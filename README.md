The purpose of this website is to present the findings of my study on the potential condescension of institutions and the press toward comedy, in contrast with audience reception. To this end, I scraped the complete historical records of the Cannes Film Festival and the César Awards and developed an LLM-based algorithm to classify comedy films without relying on the existing genre labels. The resulting datasets will be made publicly available and published on Kaggle.
