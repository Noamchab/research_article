    "film_title": "Anna and the King of Siam (film)",
    "Synopsis": "In 1862, Anna Owens arrives in Bangkok with her son Louis to tutor the children of the King. Her letter from the King asking her to come to Siam includes a promise that she will have a house of her own away from the Palace, but the Kralahome (Prime Minister) says she will have to stay in the harem for now. Anna goes to the Kralahome's office the next day and asks him to introduce her to the King so she can get the house business straightened out and start her school. When she meets the King, he tells her it is polite to prostrate oneself before him; Anna says she will bow as she would to her own Queen. Mongkut introduces her to his many wives and his 67 children and insists she live in the palace, where she will be more accessible. When she insists, she is shown a sleazy house in the fish market, but rejects it and stays in the palace, starting her school there. He finally cedes to Anna on the matter of the house. Mongkut begins summoning Anna in the middle of the night to discuss the Bible and other scholarly matters. On the way back from one of these sessions, she discovers a chained slave with a baby. This is L'Ore, who belongs to Lady Tuptim, the King's newest wife. Tuptim refuses to let L'Ore go, even though L'Ore's husband has offered to pay for her. Anna reminds the King that his own law requires that slaves must be freed if the money is offered. Tuptim runs away. Mongkut expects English visitors and asks Anna to dress some of his prettiest wives in European style and to provide English-style decor and utensils to show that he is not a barbarian. Anna suggests that the King invite consuls to come from other countries at the same time. The party is a great success, combining British, European, and Siamese traditions and convincing the visitors that Siam is a civilized nation with a proud history. Lady Tuptim is found in a Buddhist temple, disguised as a young man. At trial, she explains she couldn't stand being shut up, and so disguised herself and went to the monastery, where she was accepted as a novice and studied with Phra Palat, her former fiancé, who took holy vows when Tuptim was presented to the king. No one believes her story. Anna begs the King's help, but he is insulted that she even knows about such a private matter. Anna loses her temper and tells the king he has no heart. Phra Palat and Tuptim are both burned at the stake. Anna decides that she has had enough and says goodbye to the children. The royal wives read her a letter pleading with her to stay. Lady Thiang says that the crown prince may not grow up to be a good king if Anna doesn't stay to educate him. At the same time, Louis dies in a riding accident. When the King asks Anna to continue secretarial duties, she says, \"It's the children I want,\" and goes on with her school. Many years later, Anna is summoned to the bedside of the dying King. The King says that Anna spoke the truth to him and was a good influence on the children. He expresses his gratitude and dies. The Kralahome asks Anna to stay and help the prince. When Chulalongkorn is crowned, his first act is to abolish the practice of prostration before the King so that everyone can respect each other and work together.",

    "film_title": "Beauty and the Beast (1946 film)",
    "Synopsis": "While scrubbing the floor at home, Belle is interrupted by her brother's friend Avenant, who tells her she deserves better and suggests they get married. Belle rejects Avenant, as she wishes to stay home and take care of her father, who has suffered much since his ships were lost at sea and the family fortune along with them. Belle's father arrives home announcing he has come into a great fortune that he will pick up the next day, along with gifts for his daughters, Belle and her shrewish sisters Adelaide and Felicie. Belle's roguish brother Ludovic, believing they will soon be wealthy, signs a contract from a moneylender allowing him the ability to sue Ludovic's father if he can not pay. Belle's sisters ask for a monkey and a parrot as gifts, but Belle asks only for a rose. However, the next day, Belle's father finds on his arrival that his fortune has been seized to clear his debts and he is as penniless as before. He has no money for lodging and is forced to return home through a forest at night. He gets lost in the forest and finds himself at a large castle whose gates and doors magically open themselves. On entering the castle, he is guided by an enchanted candelabra that leads him to a laden dinner table where he falls asleep. Awakened by a loud roar, he wanders the castle's grounds. Remembering that Belle asked for a rose, he plucks a rose from a tree which makes the Beast appear. The Beast threatens to kill him for theft but suggests that one of his daughters can take his place. The Beast offers his horse Magnificent to guide him through the forest and to his home. thumb|left|150px|Page of the original scenario on display in the Jean Cocteau House in [[Milly-la-Foret, France]] Belle's father explains the situation to his family and Avenant. Belle agrees to take her father's place and rides Magnificent to the castle. Upon meeting the Beast, Belle faints at his monstrous appearance and is carried to her room in the castle. Belle awakens to find a magic mirror which allows her to see anything. The Beast invites Belle to dinner, where he tells her that she's in equal command to him and that she will be asked every day to marry him. Days pass as Belle grows more accustomed to and fond of the Beast, but she continues to refuse marriage. Using the magic mirror, Belle sees that her father has become deathly ill. Belle begs for permission to visit her family, and the Beast reluctantly grants her permission to leave for a week. He gives Belle two magical items: a glove that can transport her wherever she wishes and a golden key that unlocks Diana's Pavilion, the source of the Beast's true riches. He tells Belle that he gives her these precious items to show his trust in her, and says that if she does not return at the end of the week, he will die of grief. Belle uses the glove to appear in her bedridden father's room, where her visit restores him to health. Belle finds her family living in poverty, having never recovered from Ludovic's deal with the moneylender. Jealous of Belle's rich life at the castle, Adelaide and Felicie steal her golden key and devise a plan to turn Ludovic and Avenant against the Beast. Avenant and Ludovic devise a plan of their own to kill the Beast, and agree to aid Belle's sisters. To stall Belle, her sisters trick her into staying past her seven-day limit by pretending to love her. Belle reluctantly agrees to stay. The Beast sends Magnificent with the magic mirror to retrieve Belle but Ludovic and Avenant find Magnificent first, and ride him to the castle. Belle later finds the mirror which reveals the Beast's sorrowful face in its reflection. Belle realizes she is missing the golden key as the mirror breaks. Distraught, Belle returns to the castle using the magic glove and finds the Beast in the courtyard, near death from a broken heart. Meanwhile, Avenant and Ludovic stumble upon Diana's Pavilion. Thinking that their stolen key may trigger a trap, they scale the wall of the Pavilion. As the Beast dies in Belle's arms, Avenant breaks into the Pavilion through its glass roof, whereupon he is shot with an arrow by an animated statue of the Roman goddess Diana and is himself turned into a Beast. As this happens, arising from where the Beast lay dead is Prince Ardent who is cured of being the Beast. He explains that because his parents did not believe in spirits, the spirits turned him into the Beast as revenge. Prince Ardent and Belle embrace, then fly away to his kingdom where she will be his Queen. He promises that her father will stay with them and Belle's sisters will carry the train of her gown.",

    "Synopsis": "In a railway station refreshment room, a man and a woman are sitting glumly at a table. One of the woman's friends comes in and immediately begins chatting away. After some terse pleasantries, the man leaves to catch his train. The woman explains that the man is about to move to Africa. After the man leaves, the woman abruptly disappears but soon returns, explaining that she wanted to see the express train pass by. After a short interval, the two women head for their own train. At home, Laura Jesson, the woman at the table, sits in the living room with her husband Fred. Laura silently reflects on her recent experiences, which she retells in the form of a confession to her husband. Laura visits Milford every week to shop and watch a matinée film. During one such outing she meets idealistic doctor Alec Harvey, who works at the local hospital on Thursdays. Alec charms her by gently removing a piece of grit from her eye. Laura continues visiting Milford on Thursdays. The following week, she runs into Alec at the chemist. The week after that, they eat lunch and watch a film together. Although they are both married with children, their innocent, casual relationship begins to deepen. The situation makes them uneasy, though they admit they love each other. thumb|250px|left|Laura (Celia Johnson) and Alec (Trevor Howard) say their penultimate goodbyes at the railway station Laura and Alec continue meeting in public until they unexpectedly run into some of Laura's friends, necessitating the first of many deceptions. Eventually, they agree to make love at the flat of Alec's friend Stephen, who has dinner plans. However, Stephen returns unexpectedly. Stephen overhears Laura sneaking out and subtly chides Alec for his infidelity. A distraught Laura wanders the streets for three hours until a concerned police officer urges her to go home. At the railway station, Laura and Alec admit that their relationship is unworkable. For the sake of his family, Alec decides to end his relationship with Laura by taking a job in Johannesburg. The next week, Laura and Alec have their final meeting in the railway station refreshment room, as previously shown in the opening scene. As they prepare to part for the last time, Laura's acquaintance Dolly Messiter interrupts them, oblivious to their anguish. Alec’s train arrives before they can say a proper goodbye. He discreetly squeezes Laura’s shoulder as he departs. Laura, overcome with emotion, nearly commits suicide by jumping in front of an express train. However, she gathers herself and returns home to her family. At home, Fred acknowledges Laura's emotional distance, though whether he knows the cause remains unclear. He thanks her for coming back to him and she weeps in his arms. A parallel subplot involves the interactions of the station and refreshment room staff. Two of the staff flirt with each other but cannot engage in public displays of affection during work hours, which humorously contrasts with Laura and Alec's ability to meet openly with each other and inability to have a relationship outside of work hours.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1875, after world-famous opera singer Alice Alquist is murdered at her home in Victorian London, her orphan niece Paula is sent to Italy to follow in her footsteps. As an adult, Paula marries her accompanist Gregory Anton after a two-week whirlwind romance. They agree to settle in London and occupy her late aunt's long-vacant townhouse. Paula grapples with the memory of her aunt's murder, and Gregory suggests storing Alice's furnishings in the attic. When Paula finds a letter to her aunt from a man named Sergis Bauer, Gregory reacts violently but apologizes. He hires a young maid, Nancy, and insists that she never bother his \"high-strung\" wife. Paula is surprised when Gregory chides her supposed forgetfulness, but on a visit to the Tower of London, she cannot find an heirloom brooch he gave her, although it was stored safely in her handbag. She is plagued by noises coming from the boarded-up attic, and notices the gaslights dimming for no apparent reason when Gregory is not home. thumb|With Gregory looking on, Paula has discovered the letter from Sergis Bauer. Gregory flirts with Nancy, whose disgust for his wife only worsens Paula's nerves. Her anxious behavior is noticed by Inspector Brian Cameron of Scotland Yard, a childhood admirer of Alice. Struck by Paula's resemblance to her aunt, Cameron attempts to reopen the cold case, discovering that a gift of royal jewels was not recovered after Alice's murder. Isolating his wife from the world, Gregory convinces her that she is a kleptomaniac, responsible for hiding a painting, and is too unwell to be in public. Unable to prevent her from attending a party hosted by her old family friend, Gregory accuses Paula of stealing his pocket watch. When he \"finds\" it in her handbag, Paula becomes hysterical in front of the guests. Taking Paula home, Gregory angrily claims that her mother died in an asylum, and that the letter she discovered from Sergis Bauer never existed. Doubting her own sanity, Paula breaks down. Meanwhile, Cameron has recruited a patrolman to watch Gregory, who they learn often visits an abandoned house nearby, and is planning to institutionalize Paula. While Gregory is out, Cameron offers Paula his help, confirming that the attic noises and flickering gaslights are indeed real. He deduces that Gregory has been entering his own attic through a skylight via the neighboring vacant house, to search through Alice's belongings. When he lights the attic lights, the gas to the downstairs lights is reduced. Cameron pries open Gregory's desk, and Paula finds the letter from Bauer that her husband insisted was a delusion. \"Gregory\" is actually Sergis Bauer, who murdered Alice but was interrupted by a young Paula before he could find her jewels. His marriage to Paula was a scheme to gain access to her aunt's home, followed by a cunning strategy to have Paula institutionalized and so gain full access to Alice's estate. At the same time, Sergis discovers the jewels hidden in plain sight, sewn into one of Alice's famous costumes. He returns downstairs to find his desk unlocked. He questions the mentally exhausted Paula, who admits the desk was opened by a man that was visiting her. To protect Paula, the kindly cook Elizabeth denies seeing any man and assures Sergis that this was merely a figment of Paula's imagination, driving Paula to despair. Cameron appears and confronts Sergis, chasing him into the attic and tying him to a chair. Finally convinced of her own sanity, Paula is left alone with Sergis, who urges her to cut him free. Instead, Paula taunts him, musing that the knife in her hand might not be real and also finding the \"missing\" brooch. As the police drive Sergis away, Cameron expresses interest in seeing Paula again.",

    "Synopsis": "Johnny Farrell, an American newly arrived in Buenos Aires, Argentina, wins money from sailors at the city's docks by playing craps with weighted dice. He is rescued from a robbery attempt by a stranger, Ballin Mundson. Mundson tells Farrell about an illegal high-class casino in the city, but warns him not to cheat there. After winning at blackjack by card counting, he is taken to see the casino's owner, who turns out to be Mundson. Farrell talks Mundson into hiring him and soon becomes his trusted casino manager. Mundson returns from a trip to the United States and announces he has an extremely beautiful new wife, Gilda, whom he has married after only knowing her for a day. Farrell and Gilda instantly recognise each other from the past, though both deny it when Mundson questions them. Mundson assigns Farrell to watch over Gilda. She cavorts with men at all hours in increasingly more blatant efforts to enrage Farrell, and in return he grows ever more spiteful towards her. Mundson is visited by two German mobsters. Their organisation had financed a tungsten cartel, with everything in Mundson's name in order to hide their connection to it. They have decided that it is safe to take the cartel back since World War II has ended, but Mundson refuses to transfer ownership. Suspicious of the Germans, the Argentine police assign agent Obregón to try to obtain information from Farrell, but he knows nothing about this aspect of Mundson's operations. The Germans return to the casino during a Carnival celebration, and Mundson shoots and kills one of them. Farrell rushes to take Gilda to safety. Alone in Mundson's house, they have another confrontation and, after declaring their undying hatred for each other, passionately kiss. After hearing the front door slam, they realize that Mundson has overheard them, and a guilt-ridden Farrell pursues him to a waiting private airplane. The plane explodes in mid-air and plummets into the ocean. Mundson parachutes to safety, but Farrell, unaware of this, concludes that he is dead. Gilda inherits Mundson's estate, and she and Farrell immediately marry. He cannot set aside his resentment and suspicion of her, however. Leaving her to live alone, he also has her followed day and night by his men to keep her from seeing anyone else. Gilda tries to escape the tortured marriage a number of times, but Farrell thwarts every attempt. Obregón confiscates the casino from Farrell and informs him that Gilda was never truly unfaithful to Mundson or to him, prompting Farrell to try to reconcile with her as he prepares to return to the United States. At that moment, Mundson reappears, revealing his faked suicide. He tries to kill both Gilda and Farrell but casino worker Uncle Pío fatally stabs him in the back. When Obregón arrives, Johnny tries to take the blame for the murder, but Obregón points out that Mundson was already declared legally dead. Farrell gives Obregón incriminating documents from Mundson's safe. He and Gilda finally reconcile, agreeing to go home together. <gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"160px\"> File:Gilda trailer rita hayworth2.JPG|Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford) and Gilda (Rita Hayworth) File:Gilda trailer hayworth1.JPG|\"Gilda, are you decent?\" </gallery>",

    "Synopsis": "The film begins in 1944 with a parade of German prisoners of war. Among the crowd of Soviet citizens observing them is Tatyana Krylova, who listens to a woman comment on the prisoners' unkempt appearance, calling them barbarians. When the woman points out a limping soldier with an intellectual demeanor, suggesting he may have been forced into the war, Tatyana interjects, stating she has seen such \"civilized\" Germans before, and all turned out to be killers. She then begins recounting her story. In 1942, Tatyana, assigned the number 217, and her friend Klava Vasilyeva are forcibly taken to Germany as Ostarbeiters. Klava is sent to work in a factory, while Tatyana becomes a maid for the Krauss family, who own a grocery store. Another Ostarbeiter, Sergey, a mathematician, works for the Krausses as a stablehand. The family, including their daughter Lotte and her fiancé, Rudolf Peschke, treat Tatyana with disdain, subjecting her to heavy labor and constant humiliation. Despite the hardship, Tatyana finds hope in Sergey’s plan to save leftover bread to prepare for an escape in spring, intending to take Klava with them. Klava's situation at the factory is even worse, as the workers are frequently beaten. Meanwhile, Lotte and Rudolf plan to marry, but Rudolf, seeking to appear wealthy, pressures the Krausses for money, knowing they hold a significant sum left with them by a Jewish acquaintance. Tensions escalate as Rudolf resorts to abusing Sergey, who secretly continues his mathematical work, leading to Sergey’s mental decline. Matters worsen when Max, the Krausses’ son, returns from the Eastern Front with his friend Kurt, revealing himself to be a hardened and brutal soldier. Conflict erupts over the hidden money, culminating in Max and Kurt murdering Sergey after falsely accusing him of defaming Germany. That night, during a Soviet air raid, Tatyana kills Max and Kurt in their sleep and escapes with Klava. The Krauss household is destroyed in the bombing, but Klava succumbs to her injuries during their journey. Tatyana eventually finds refuge in a train carrying injured Ostarbeiters back to the Soviet Union. Returning to 1944, it is revealed that the limping soldier Tatyana observed is Rudolf, likely conscripted after Germany declared total war. Tatyana delivers a poignant speech, asserting that Germans cannot absolve themselves by blaming Adolf Hitler alone. She emphasizes their responsibility to remember the horrors of war and its devastating consequences forever.",

    "film_title": "María Candelaria",
    "Synopsis": "A young journalist presses an old artist to display the portrait of a naked indigenous woman that he has in his study. As the artist begins to tell the story behind the painting, the action becomes a flashback to Xochimilco, Mexico in 1909, right before the Mexican Revolution. Xochimilco is an area with beautiful landscapes inhabited mostly by indigenous people. The woman in the painting is María Candelaria (Dolores del Río), a young indigenous woman shunned by her own people for being the daughter of a prostitute. She and her lover, Lorenzo Rafael, face constant exclusion and threats. They receive criticism and condemnation from the townspeople. They are honest and hardworking, yet nothing ever goes right for them. Don Damián, a jealous Mestizo store owner who wants María for himself, prevents María and Lorenzo from getting married and pursues Maria over a minor debt. Maria owes Don money for goods. She tries to sell him her flowers and Lorenzo tries to sell him vegetables but he refuses to take them. Instead, he kills a piglet that María and Lorenzo planned to raise and sell for profit so that they would have enough money to get married. When María contracts malaria, Don Damián refuses to give the couple the quinine necessary to fight the disease. Lorenzo breaks into the store to steal the medicine and takes a wedding dress for María. Lorenzo goes to prison for stealing and María agrees to model for the painter to pay for his release. The artist begins painting her portrait and then asks her to pose nude, which she refuses to do. The artist finishes the painting with the nude body of another woman. When the people of Xochimilco see the painting, they assume it is María Candelaria. They think that she turned out just like her mother so they stone her to death, and burn her house, while Lorenzo watches helplessly. Similarly, the portrayal of prejudiced villagers - primarily shrill and bullying women - is not particularly subtle, though the interactions with the priest reveal a more complex and fluctuating negotiation between narrowminded superstition and (in this context) a relatively enlightened form of Christianity. The village women's malevolent temperament (all scowlers giving the evil eye) is contrasted with María Candelaria's 'innocent' beauty - \"the essence of authentic Mexican beauty,\" according to the painter (Alberto Galán), who is also crucial in the tragedy that unfolds.",

    "Synopsis": "The film takes place in the occupied Republic of Czechoslovakia after the assassination of Schutzstaffel-Obergruppenführer and General der Polizei Reinhard Heydrich, head of the Reich Security Main Office, the combined security services of Nazi Germany, and acting Reichsprotektor of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. In Prague on 27 May 1942. Jirka is a boy whose family was murdered in the village of Lidice as repercussions for the assassination of Heydrich. He stays with his uncle, engineer Petr Lom and Marta, a young girl living next door, who works at the post office to help take care of the boy. Lom has just started working on the military airport, governed by Sudeten-Nazi Ullman. Resistance is quite active in the airport, collecting arms and grenades and communicating with allies. They have a lot of great intel thanks to secretary Jana Tomešová, who is Ullman's trustee and has access to a lot of restricted information. Jirka also starts working at the airport, but he is filled with sorrow and in need of revenge. He gets caught stealing a grenade and is arrested by the Gestapo, and later shot. When Jana sees him she faints and Ullman finds a secret message she had with her. He tells his Gestapo friends and goes to the warehouse to investigate where he gets killed by being pushed onto a transformer. The Gestapo start arresting and searching houses of airport workers, revealing that Marta is an informer for the Germans. Lom is not aware of this as he is still struck by Jirka's death. He picks the gun from his hideout and walks back to the airport. After the neighbours tell him the truth about Marta, Lom kills her and helps Jana escape. Germans gather airport workers and threaten to kill them if no one says who killed Ullman. Then Lom appears saying he did it and kills some Gestapo officers, he is killed by the soldiers. In the last scene of the film, a dying Lom has a vision of the future. He sees a woman with gun going forward with war atrocities around her. However she does not stop until the war is over and the Czechoslovak flag appears on a mast.",

    "Synopsis": "In a little town in the south-west of France during the German occupation, Édouard Martin handles the insurance needs of his fellow citizens and also, unknown to his family, is the local head of the Resistance. An officer in the First World War, he runs his network on disciplined lines, following orders from headquarters in London, who supply radios and arms by air. When a stranger named Jourdan is parachuted in and wants to mount dangerous attacks, he deduces that the man is an imposter and has him shot. Called in for questioning and asked if he knows Jourdan, he says the man is a Gaullist bastard. “Oh”, says the German officer, “He' s one of our agents, but seems to have gone missing.” When it becomes apparent that the Germans are using a factory near his house to build mini-submarines, he asks for the Royal Air Force to destroy it. Since a raid might damage his own house and those of his neighbours, he asks them all to a dinner party in a restaurant. The pretext is the engagement of one of Édouard's deputies, Pelletier, who is in love with his daughter Monique. Lancaster bombers flatten the factory and the Germans, deducing that Édouard must have known in advance, arrest him. Damaged but alive, he is rescued by his network and, when the Germans retreat in 1944, reunited with his proud family.",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should contain between 400 to 700 words. --> In April 1946, Alicia Huberman, the American daughter of a convicted German spy, is recruited by government agent T. R. Devlin to infiltrate a group of German emigréss who escaped to Brazil after World War II. When Alicia refuses to help the authorities, Devlin plays recordings of her fighting with her father, insisting that she loves the United States. right|thumb|Devlin and Alicia meet at the racetrack. While awaiting the details of her assignment in Rio de Janeiro, Alicia and Devlin fall in love, though his feelings are complicated by her promiscuous past. When Devlin receives instructions to persuade her to seduce Alex Sebastian, her father's friend and a leading IG Farben executive, Devlin fails to convince his superiors that it is too much to ask of Alicia. The superiors cynically observe that seduction is not out of character for her. Told that Sebastian was once in love with Alicia, Devlin puts up a stoic front when informing Alicia about the mission. Mistakenly, Alicia infers that he was pretending to love her as part of his job. Devlin contrives to have Alicia meet Sebastian at a riding club. Recognizing her, Sebastian pursues her, saying he always knew they would be united. He invites Alicia to a dinner party at his home, where he will host a few business acquaintances. Devlin and Captain Paul Prescott of the U.S. Secret Service instruct Alicia to memorize the names and nationalities of everyone there. At dinner, Alicia observes a guest become agitated at the sight of a certain wine bottle; he is ushered quickly from the room. When the gentlemen are alone at the end of the dinner, this guest apologizes and tries to go home, but another insists on driving him, implying that the neurotic and untrustworthy associate will be killed. Alicia soon reports to Devlin, \"You can add Sebastian's name to my list of playmates.\" Later, Alicia informs Devlin and Prescott that Sebastian has proposed to her. Disappointed by Devlin's indifference, she marries Sebastian. left|thumb|Alicia takes the wine cellar key while Sebastian dresses for the party. The gown is by Edith Head. After returning from her honeymoon, Alicia tells Devlin that the key ring her husband gave her lacks a key to the wine cellar. Devlin suggests that Alicia throw a grand party and invite him, so he can investigate. Alicia secretly steals the key from Sebastian's ring, and Devlin and Alicia search the cellar. Devlin accidentally breaks a bottle; inside is black sand, later proven to be uranium ore. Taking a sample, Devlin hastily cleans up and locks the door. As Sebastian comes down for more champagne, Devlin kisses Alicia to create a distraction from their search. Alicia insists to Sebastian that Devlin is drunk and persistent; she brought him down to the cellar to prevent him from making an embarrassing scene in front of the party guests. Sebastian realizes that the cellar key is missing from his key ring, but the next morning, he finds that Alicia has reattached it during the night. Returning to the cellar, he finds remnants of glass and sand from the broken bottle. Sebastian knows he must silence Alicia but cannot expose her without revealing his own blunder to his unforgiving co-conspirators, who will kill him if they learn that he has married an American agent. Sebastian discusses the situation with his mother, who suggests that Alicia \"die slowly\" by poisoning. Alicia soon falls ill, and her illness worsens until she collapses and is confined to her room, where the telephone has been removed. Too weak to leave, she perceives that she has been exposed. Alarmed by Alicia's continuing absence, Devlin sneaks into Alicia's room, where she tells him that Sebastian and his mother are poisoning her. Shaken by Alicia's peril, he confesses his love for her. He supports her down the steps in full view of Sebastian and his co-conspirators. To avoid the others catching on, Sebastian feigns husbandly concern, helping Devlin support Alicia down the steps, and accepting Devlin's story that hearing Alicia call out, Devlin found her condition worsened and needing immediate hospitalization. The conspirators are suspicious. Outside, Sebastian begs Devlin and Alicia to take him with them in Devlin's car, but they contemptuously drive away, leaving him behind to suffer a grim fate at the hands of his co-conspirators.",

    "Synopsis": "In Brooklyn, New York, an upright piano is being lifted into the home of the Gershwins, Morris and Rose, and the two sons, Ira Gershwin, and his little brother, George Gershwin. Morris tells Ira that she set him up for piano lessons, but Ira shows distaste for it. As they talk, they hear George play a tune on the piano. Morris and Rose change their mind and quickly sign George up for lessons. As George grows, and his talents beginning to set in, he starts to become more interested in the music of Tin Pan Alley. He passes through multiple teachers, and finally stays at Prof. Franck. George shows the Prof. his musical talents with Jazz, and Prof. Franck says that if this is what he wants to do, he should pursue it. George begins to write many songs, but none of them really take off. He gets a job as a pianist for a show held by Harpo Marx. He is mocked by the actor on stage, and George storms out of the theater, with Ira by his side. George then gets a job as a song plugger, playing songs for people to see if they would like the piece of music. Through this, George meets Julie Adams, who's a singer on Broadway. George notices how good a singer she is, and suggests that she sing a song he wrote, \"Swanee.\" She eventually likes it, and George gives her his copy of it, and the rest of the copies he plays, even some he didn't write. George calls his boss and tells him he quits. George goes to pitch his song to Max Dreyfus. While waiting, George meets Oscar Levant, who will eventually become his closest friend. George shows his song to Max, and Max sees potential in the song, and the writer. Max, still with Gershwin in his office, calls the singer Al Jolson, and asks him if he will sing the tune in a show, and Al, after hearing Gershwin playing it on the other end, says he will. Al sings the song to a thunderous applause, which inspires Gershwin to write his own musical. He casts Julie as his leading lady, as she's the only one for the role. The show flops, but Gershwin continues, and eventually his shows begin to skyrocket, all with Julie in the lead. While this, Julie begins to fall in love with George, while he seems oblivious to it. While Gershwin is backstage dressing up for a dinner party, he is approached by the bandleader Paul Whiteman. Whiteman tells Gershwin of a show he's putting on, aiming to fuse Jazz and serious European Classical Music. At the dinner party, Prof. Franck and Dreyfus get into a fight about this idea, Max saying it won't work and he should continue to write hits, and Franck telling him to do what he feels right. Gershwin eventually agrees, and writes Rhapsody in Blue. Gershwin plays the piano for the piece at the premiere, which was attended by the like of Igor Stravinsky and Sergei Rachmaninoff. He performs to a wonderful applause, and his career is now in action. After the performance, he goes to visit Prof. Franck, but learns he fell sick and couldn't make it to the performance because he was dying. Shortly after, a man approaches Gershwin to write a Concerto for the New York Philharmonic and to premiere at the prestigious Carnegie Hall, but Gershwin is hesitant at first, because he feels that he doesn't have enough experience with classical music to write one. Gershwin continues to write musicals, and finds that Ira is aspiring to be a lyricist. George quickly finds that Ira is a wordsmith, and let's Ira write the lyrics for his next musical, \"Lady be Good\", which becomes a smash hit. Gershwin then travels to Paris to find inspiration for his concerto, where, in a small night club, he hears his song Fascinating Rhythm being played to welcome him to the country. While in Paris, Gershwin meets Christine Gilbert. They begin to go on many outings together, and they eventually both fall in love with each other. Gershwin takes Christine back to America, where he hosts a party. He also invites Julie, who meets Christine, and is greatly distressed. It is here where George and Ira coin each other \"Mr. Words\" and \"Mr. Music\". George eventually plays his song \"The Man I Love\" on the piano, with Julie's accompaniment, but while singing, Julie becomes overwhelmed with Christine and George, begins to cry, and leaves without saying anything to George. Not very soon after, Gershwin becomes infatuated with painting, and begins to paint regularly. Christine walks in on George painting, where she admits her love to him. George tells her they'll have a pent house in New York, built for two. Julie disregards this, saying that he \"sounds like his songs.\" She tells him to get back to his painting, which he does, and she leaves heartbroken.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1944, on the eve of Rome's liberation by the Allies, communist and local leader of the Italian Resistance Luigi Ferraris (hiding under the alias of engineer Giorgio Manfredi) eludes capture by the SS. He takes refuge at the home of Francesco, another resistance fighter. With the help of Francesco's pregnant wife Pina, Luigi contacts Don Pietro, a Catholic priest, who helps deliver money and messages to a group of partisans outside the city. thumb|left|Anna Magnani as Pina in a famous scene from the film Nazi commander Major Bergmann organises a raid of Francesco's apartment building. While Luigi again escapes, Francesco is arrested and thrown in a truck to be hauled off. Seeing him, Pina breaks through a cordon screaming his name, but is shot dead by the soldiers in front of her young son. Don Pietro, who was in the building to erase any trace of the Resistance weapons under the guise of administering last rites for a dying man, holds her in his arms and prays. The German convoy carrying Francesco and other Italian prisoners is attacked by the partisans. Most of the prisoners manage to escape, and Francesco reconnects with Luigi. The two then hide at the home of Luigi's girlfriend, nightclub performer Marina. Luigi rebukes Marina over her lifestyle and Marina, having become addicted to painkillers by Gestapo agent Ingrid, betrays both him and Francesco to the Nazis. Luigi and Don Pietro are arrested the next morning, while Francesco narrowly eludes capture. Ingrid rewards Marina with a fur coat and more painkillers. Bergmann, seeking to extract everything from his captives before dawn in order to take the partisans by surprise, orders Luigi to be tortured and forces Don Pietro to watch. In an attempt to sway Don Pietro, he describes Luigi as an atheist, a communist and an enemy of the Church, while Don Pietro placidly responds that anyone who strives to live a righteous life is doing God's work. Luigi eventually dies without revealing anything. Marina, who was in the adjacent officers' club, faints after witnessing the aftermath. Ingrid declares that she is now useless and retrieves her fur coat. Don Pietro is executed the following morning, though a German officer has to intervene when the Italian firing squad appears reluctant in carrying out the order. The parish altar boys look on and whistles a Resistance tune to Don Pietro, which heartens him. The boys then bow their heads in grief and slowly depart, the city of Rome and the dome of St. Peter's Basilica looming in the background.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1940, Czechoslovak Army Captain Karel Hašek escapes from Dachau and reaches France during the German invasion. He assumes the identity of a dead British officer, Geoffrey Mitchell, and becomes a prisoner of war after the German victory. Hašek is initially suspected of being a spy by the British prisoners, because he can speak German and no one else from Mitchell's unit was captured. Some wish to lynch him. But Major Dalrymple, the senior British officer, hears Hašek out and believes him, especially after Gestapo agent Forster visits the camp. Forster ran Dachau during Hašek's stay, and eyes Hašek suspiciously. To avoid exposure, Hašek must maintain the fiction that Mitchell is still alive. He gets a letter from Mitchell's abandoned wife Celia, reminding her husband of their two children and hoping to rekindle their marriage. Since the Germans read all prisoner correspondence, Hašek decides he must respond as if he were Mitchell, now returning Celia's affection. They exchange many letters, and develop a relationship. Forster visits the camp several times, and Hašek fears he may be unmasked. Forster compliments him on his nearly perfect German and seems to recognise him, but cannot quite place him. Later, after almost four years captivity, Forster tells Hašek he knows he is not Mitchell and that his photograph has been sent to Berlin for identification. Soon after, it is announced that some prisoners are to be repatriated, but when Hašek goes for his medical exam, he is turned away. The other prisoners devise a plan to save him without his knowledge. Private Mathews is on the repatriation list and volunteers to let Hašek go in his place. Major Dalrymple, Hašek's friend Lieutenant Stephen Hardy, and Mathews (a burglar in civilian life) break into the Kommandant's office and replace \"Mathews\" with \"Mitchell\" on the list. The plan works, and Hašek is \"returned\" to Britain. Celia goes to meet the repatriation group, but is baffled when her husband does not appear. Hašek explains his situation to the British authorities, and enrolls in the Free Czechoslovak Army. He also travels to Celia's residence and breaks the news of her husband's death and his impersonation. She is devastated, and Hašek leaves. After she recovers, however, she rereads his letters, realizing that she has fallen in love with the writer. When Hašek calls her on the telephone on V-E Day, she is eager to speak with him.",

    "Synopsis": "When the Allies land in southern Italy in 1943, Allied prisoners of war held there are evacuated north by their captors. Some prisoners escape when a train is bombed at night, and Englishman Lieutenant Halliday and American Sergeant Braddock team up. A civilian hides them in a cart carrying sacks of wheat past an Italian security check, and they break off into the countryside. They search for a boat to cross a river, and a pretty young woman tells them an armistice has been signed. They enter a town which is strangely quiet, just before the Germans arrive to take over. The woman's uncle gives the two men civilian clothes and recommends they sneak aboard a freight train. At one stop, they watch helplessly as a woman named Frau Wittels is separated from her husband by the Germans. They leave the train to head into the mountains where they encounter partisans who let them cross a bridge, warning them not to endanger the people in the town. They encounter a friendly priest in the church and introduces Halliday Giuseppe, who can guide them with some refugees through the mountains. Among them are a Polish tailor and his niece, a factory worker from Belgrade, a professor more concerned about his papers than his own life, Frenchwoman Madame Monnier, Frau Wittels and her son Bernard. British Major Telford, also hidden in the church, persuades Halliday and Braddock to join the partisans. A radio broadcast announces that Il Duce, the deposed Italian fascist leader, has been freed by the Germans and a disgruntled former fascist leaves to betray the refugees. That night, shooting is heard coming from the bridge. The priest tells the group to hide in the woods, leaving the children and old people in his charge, and persuades the three soldiers to lead the refugees to Giuseppe. The fascist informant reluctantly tells the priest that he has to take him to the Germans. The refugees reach Giuseppe's village to find the Germans have gotten there first and killed Giuseppe and all other men of the village. The major reluctantly agrees to take the new orphans with them into the mountains. The aged tailor cannot keep up in the snowstorm, but the others find shelter in a mountain rescue hut. When the storm ends, a German patrol appears with orders to close the frontier. They bypass the hut but block the pass. Halliday proposes he create a diversion with the five bullets left in the major's pistol, but Telford refuses. Instead, the entire party set out at night, hoping to escape detection, and elude a ski patrol when Bernard draws the Germans away, at the cost of his life. The others make it into Switzerland, though Halliday is shot. A Swiss officer informs them only children, people over 65 and political refugees can remain but gets authority from the government to let everyone stay. In the final scene, they attend Halliday's funeral.",

    "film_title": "The Lost Weekend",
    "Synopsis": "On Thursday, alcoholic New York writer Don Birnam is packing for a weekend vacation with his brother Wick. Although they are leaving mid-afternoon, when Don's girlfriend Helen drops by with gifts for him and two tickets for a concert that afternoon, Don suggests that Wick attends with her; the brothers can then catch a later train. His motive is self-serving: he has a bottle hanging by a rope outside the window and wants to retrieve it and secure it in his suitcase. Wick eventually discovers the bottle. Don claims to have forgotten it was there; Wick pours it down the drain. Now, knowing that all the liquor Don had hidden in the apartment has been disposed of, and believing that he has no money for more, Helen and Wick go to the concert. After finding ten dollars Wick left for the cleaning lady, Don heads for Nat's Bar, calling in at a liquor store on the way to purchase two bottles of rye. He intends to be back home in time to meet Wick and catch their train but his drinking makes him lose track of time. Arriving home, he sees Wick and Helen on the street and, concealing himself, overhears Wick say that he has given up on helping Don and is leaving, scolding Helen for deciding to stay and wait for Don. Don sneaks back into the apartment and hides a bottle while drinking the other one. On Friday, at Nat's Bar, Don learns that Helen came in looking for him the previous night. Don says that he intends to write a novel about his battle with alcoholism, called The Bottle. In a flashback, he recalls how he first met Helen at the opera house. The cloakroom has mixed up their coats. Subsequently, the two strike up a romance, and he remains sober during this time. While going to meet her parents, he overhears them talking about his unemployment and how they are not certain if he is good enough for Helen. He loses his nerve and sneaks off, after phoning Helen from a booth and making a phony excuse, ostensibly intending to meet her parents later. However, he returns home and gets drunk. She goes to his apartment, where Wick tries to cover for him, but Don confesses that he is two people: \"Don the writer\", whose fear of failure causes him to drink, and \"Don the drunk\", who always has to be bailed out by Wick. Helen devotes herself to helping him. After telling Nat the story behind his proposed novel, Don heads back home to begin writing it. However, his alcohol cravings get the better of him and he begins a search for that second bottle from the previous night. He cannot remember where he hid it. He goes to a nightclub, realizes that he cannot pay the bill and steals money from a woman's purse. He is caught, thrown out, and told never to return. Once home, he finds the hidden bottle by chance and drinks himself into a stupor. On Saturday, Don is broke and feeling sick. He decides to pawn his typewriter so he can buy more alcohol, although he dreads the walk to the shop because he feels so ill. He discovers the pawnshops are closed for Yom Kippur. Desperate for money, he visits Gloria, a prostitute who has a crush on him. She gives him some money, but he falls down her stairs and is knocked unconscious. On Sunday, Don wakes up in an alcoholics' ward at Bellevue Hospital, where a nurse, Bim Nolan, mocks him and other guests at \"Hangover Plaza\". Bim offers to help offset his sure-to-come delirium tremens, but Don rejects the assistance and escapes while the staff is occupied with a raving, violent patient. On Monday, Don steals a bottle of whiskey from a store after threatening the owner and spends the day drinking. Suffering from delirium tremens, he hallucinates a nightmarish scene in which a bat flies in through his window and kills a mouse, spilling its blood. His screams alert the tenant, who contacts Helen, who immediately goes over. Finding Don collapsed and in a delirious state, she assists him to clean up and get to bed; she stays overnight on his couch. On Tuesday morning, Don slips out and pawns Helen's coat, the one that had brought them together. She trails him to the pawn shop and learns from the pawnbroker that Don traded the coat for his gun, for which he has bullets at home. She races back to Don's apartment and interrupts him just as he is about to shoot himself. She pleads with him, even going so far as to beg him to drink the last portion of whisky left in the bottle he had stolen and which she had concealed. She declares she would rather he be alive as an alcoholic. He refuses and, while they are arguing, Nat arrives to return Don's typewriter. After Nat leaves, Helen finally convinces him that \"Don the writer\" and \"Don the drunk\" are the same person. He commits to writing his novel The Bottle, dedicated to her, which will recount the events of the weekend. As evidence of his resolve, he drops a cigarette into the glass of whisky to make it undrinkable.",

    "Synopsis": "In German-occupied Denmark during World War II, the young Danish saboteur Michael (Poul Reichhardt) sits in a Gestapo jail and awaits his execution. His thoughts go back to the events that led to his capture. In a meadow in Jutland, Michael and his comrades wait for a British airdrop of weapons and explosives to use for the resistance. Afterward, while in his hideout, Michael is surprised by German soldiers. He shoots his way out and is able to slip free. On a country road, a car driven by a German Field Officer (Arne Hershold) stops. Michael overpowers the officer and shoots him. Dressed in the officer's uniform, Michael is able to reach Copenhagen and find his girlfriend Ruth (Lisbeth Movin) at the hotel where she lives. Toto (Lau Lauritzen), the leader of the resistance group, is waiting for him. They are planning to sabotage a weapons factory. However, there is suspicion that there is an informant in the group, so the plan is delayed. One of the group's members, Dreyer (Freddy Koch), is arrested, so Ruth and Michael flee to her uncle's summer house. Ruth is frightened of losing Michael. She says, If you die, then everything is meaningless - then I'm not a person anymore - and the meadows aren't green anymore -- they are colored the red of your blood. Plans for the sabotage are completed and the group goes into action. But it is revealed that there has been an informant, when the group is surprised by soldiers lying in wait for them. During the firefight, Michael is wounded. However, he is able to blow up the factory before he is captured. Back in the Gestapo jail, the prison guard Steinz (Per Buckhøj) who hates the war and the Nazis, tries to help Michael in small ways, but is unable to prevent his torture. Michal is able to resist during the brutal torture, but he is condemned to death. While in jail, Michael suspects who the informant is and through Steinz gets a message to his comrades: The apple is rotten. A trap is set and Prikken (Preben Neergaard) reveals himself as the informer. There is no other way but to kill him and it is not difficult to find members who will do it. While being driven to his execution, Steinz tells Michael that he has received a message—Steinz's entire family was killed during an Allied aerial bombardment that week. Michael asks Steinz to escape with him. Steinz declines and shoots himself in the car. Michael flees and seeks refuge in a bakery where he is able to contact Toto. Both Michael and Ruth find transport to Sweden where they can finally rest.",

    "Synopsis": "Francesca Cunningham is a brilliant concert pianist suffering from a delusion that she has lost the use of her hands. Despairing, she slips out of the nursing home where she is staying and jumps into the river. She survives, but is unresponsive. Dr. Larsen, a psychiatrist specializing in hypnosis, leads Francesca to describe events in her life, that appear as flashbacks. When she is 14, and at boarding school, music is \"everything\". Following a transgression, a teacher canes Francesca on her hands, causing her fingers to swell and thus ruining her chances of winning a piano scholarship that afternoon. After the sudden death of her father, Francesca is placed in the care of his second cousin, Nicholas, a misogynistic bachelor who walks with a cane. Nicholas ignores her until a school report reveals that she is a gifted pianist. Nicholas does not play well, but he is a brilliant and inspiring teacher. They work for hours every day and he arranges for Francesca to become a pupil at the Royal College of Music; but he violently rejects her demonstration of gratitude. At the college, Francesca meets Peter, a brash American musician studying in London, who charms her and opens a new world to her, including music (in particular a waltz) that Nicholas scorns as \"suburban shop girl trash\". Francesca proposes to Peter, who accepts, but when Nicholas hears the news he calmly orders her to pack a bag because they are leaving for Paris the following morning to continue her studies. When Francesca tries to defy him he reminds her that she is only 17, and under his control until she is 21. Francesca tells Larsen that for the next seven years Nicholas never let her out of his sight as they prepared for her future as a concert pianist. Over and over again, he reminded her to take care of her precious hands. Prior to Francesca's debut concert in Venice, an old school friend visits her dressing room and tactlessly reminds her of the failed music exam; the stress is so great that, although the concert is a success, Francesca faints on stage at its completion. \"I could almost feel my fingers swelling …\" she tells Larsen. Francesca’s career progresses and eventually she performs at the Royal Albert Hall, to an overwhelming audience response. Nicholas presents her with flowers after her performance, but she brushes past him to go out to find Peter. She finds him by chance, after seeing a poster outside the elegant nightclub where he leads the band. The band plays \"their\" waltz and they dance; but Francesca refuses to tell the doctor what happened next. Instead, she tells him about Maxwell Leyden, an artist whom Nicholas commissions to do her portrait. Francesca and Max soon fall in love and decide to go to live in Max's villa in Italy. Nicholas is outraged. Francesca tells him she is grateful for many things, but will never forgive him for others. As he rants loudly that she belongs to him, Francesca plays the second movement (adagio cantabile) of the Piano Sonata No. 8 by Beethoven, louder and louder, drowning him out. Furious, he slams his cane down on the keyboard, just missing her hands. She screams and runs to Max who whisks her away in his car. But there is an accident and Francesca wakes in the nursing home with bandages on her slightly burned hands, irrationally convinced she will never play again. The story has come full circle. While she is still under hypnosis, Larsen gets her to play the adagio, but the memory of Nicholas intrudes, and she faints. Max removes her from the nursing home and refuses to let Larsen continue treatment. Larsen goes to Nicholas and plays a recording of the adagio, but Nicholas breaks the record. Larsen thanks him for revealing what Francesca means to him. Nicholas goes to Max's house and convinces Francesca that Larsen can help her. Meanwhile, Larsen sees Peter, who tells him that the night Francesca returned, he told her he was married. However, he is now divorced. Larsen brings Peter to Nicholas's home, where Max also waits, and they go upstairs. We hear Peter's waltz, and then the adagio. Larsen descends while Francesca plays. He warns the three men that she is a new Francesca, no longer afraid, who will want to be with the one she loves, trusts, has been happiest with, and cannot live without. Nicholas withdraws to another room. Smiling, Francesca runs downstairs, through the door and into his arms.",

    "Synopsis": "The story is told from the point of view the old storyteller Slyshko. The skilled gemcutter Prokopych is getting old, and the landlord's bailiff forces him to take an apprentice. Prokopych tries to teach several boys, but none of them understands \"the soul of stone\". Eventually he picks a young boy Danilo, who appears to be very scatterbrain and careless in everything else, but shows extreme talent in shaping gemstones and creating patterns. He quickly surpasses his old teacher, who takes a liking to him. Prokopych decides to keep him away from the craft for the time being because gemcutting can seriously damage health. Years pass. One day the landlord summons Prokopych. He announces that he has been to France and visited a marquess, who showed him the beautifully crafted casket; the landlord started bragging that he had \"a better one at home\", and they made a bet that the landlord's casket would prove more beautiful. He now needs to present the casket, so he orders Prokopych to make one that should be so beautiful that \"you will not be able to take your eyes of it\". Prokopych works day and night, but fails to think of an original design. Danilo makes the malachite casket for him. The landlord's wife is very satisfied with his work and orders a stone cup \"that would look exactly like a flower\". Danilo starts working on the cup. He wants to create something outstanding to reveal \"the full power of stone\". Prokopych scolds him for trying too hard for no good reason, but secretly admires Danilo's determination. He believes that it is a sign of the expert craftsman. Danilo works on his flower cup for several months, paying little attention to his fiancée Katinka. After he finishes the cup, every villager admires his work, but Danilo is unhappy. He feels that there is no true \"living\" beauty in his malachite cup, yet he wants to collect \"all the beauty of the real flower\" and convey it though stone. An old craftsman warns him against walking this path, otherwise he might end up as one of the Mistress of the Copper Mountain's craftsmen. Those craftsmen understood the beauty of stone after they saw the legendary Stone Flower. However, those who saw the Flower never wanted to go back from the Mistress' domain. Katinka asks her beloved to forget about the Stone Flower, but he is tempted. Danilo finally decides to marry Katinka. Nevertheless, at the wedding he goes back to his room, destroys his flower cup and goes to the mine. He begs the Mistress of the Copper Mountain to show him the Stone Flower. She warns him that he would never want to go back to people after seeing it, and reminds him of Katinka. He replies that he does not feel alive anyway. In the domain of the Mistress, he finally sees the Flower. He stays there, working on the new cup. Danilo is saddened by the fact that his work, albeit marvellous, will never be seen by people. He admits that he thinks about Katinka day and night, but the Mistress of the Copper Mountain claims that she is jealous and refuses to let him go. She asks him to marry her, but Danilo refuses. Katinka never marries another, believing that Danilo is still alive. She moves in with Prokopych and takes care of the old man. He teaches her some gemcutting. Although he believes that this is not \"a woman's craft\", Katinka's work is good. She earns enough money to make ends meet. While searching for some good stones in the forest, Katinka meets the Mistress of the Copper Mountain and demands that she let her beloved go. Inside the mine, Katinka rejoins with Danilo. The Mistress praises Danilo for his honor and fidelity, and says that the couple passed her test. She presents a casket filled with jewellery for Katinka, and rewards Danilo by letting him remember all that he learned at her domain. Danilo and Katinka leave together.",

    "Synopsis": "During the Great Patriotic War, German and fascist forces advance toward the Volga River. The Wehrmacht concentrates troops to seize a Russian city on the Volga's banks. The Soviet high command fears that the fall of the unnamed city (marked on maps as \"Stalingrad\") could have catastrophic consequences for the Eastern Front, provoking an attack on the USSR by Japan and other nations. General V. V. Vinogradov, commanding the front, suggests retreating to avoid disaster and save the army, but General Krivenko argues against it. The Supreme Command of the Soviet Armed Forces appoints General K. S. Muravyov to lead the front and orders: \"The city must not be surrendered; prepare to defeat the German forces!\" Muravyov prepares an active defence for the city and reunites with his wife, Liza, who also serves in the army. Muravyov believes the key to victory is to buy time without depleting strategic reserves, exhausting the enemy before delivering a decisive blow. He feels his opponent, the German general von Klaus, has overestimated his strength and underestimated the Red Army. Muravyov reluctantly orders the evacuation of industrial enterprises to be halted because \"an empty city will not be defended.\" General Vinogradov is reassigned as chief of staff. Heavy German attacks are constantly reinforced but Muravyov refuses to send soldiers or tanks from his own strategic reserves. The German forces are halted, but not before occupying significant portions of the city. Muravyov's wife dies in the fighting. Muravyov replaces General Krivenko, who advocates for a flanking counterattack, with the cautious and strategic General Panteleev. An expert on fortifications, Panteleev believes the city’s defensive position offers significant advantages, depriving the enemy of their key asset: mobile tank units. He proposes measures for active defense. Muravyov stresses that the city must not be surrendered, urging the defense of every building on the western bank of the Volga, and predicts von Klaus will use his best divisions inside the city, creating an opportunity for Soviet forces to encircle the Germans. Soviet intelligence reports the timing of the German final assault, and Muravyov plans a concentrated artillery strike to weaken the approaching German forces. When a barrage of artillery strikes the German concentrations on time, the Soviets anxiously await their decision: will the Germans proceed with the attack or delay? Muravyov’s plan proves correct as despite heavy losses, von Klaus launches his offensive, triggering the Soviet counterattack. Soviet forces, bolstered by strategic and front-line reserves, push the Germans back with a counteroffensive. Muravyov successfully executes the Supreme Command's plan, trapping and destroying the enemy forces.

    "Synopsis": "A sadistic secondary school Latin teacher, nicknamed \"Caligula\" by his long-suffering students, rules his classroom at a Stockholm school like his kingdom. He singles out Jan-Erik, one of his most diligent students. One night Jan-Erik is returning home and finds an intoxicated young woman crying on the street. He recognizes her as Bertha, the clerk in a tobacco store near the school, and he walks her home. Bertha has a taste for men and liquor, and Jan-Erik spends most of the night on her bedside. He becomes very involved with her, and his schoolwork suffers. Bertha also has an older man whom she fears, although she will not reveal his name. It transpires that he is Caligula, and he learns of his student's involvement. Caligula retaliates by making life at school even worse for Jan-Erik, and forces Bertha to do his will by threatening to suspend Jan-Erik. But Caligula is too violent with Bertha, and one day, Jan-Erik arrives to find her dead. He finds Caligula hiding in a corner, and calls the police. With no proof, however, Caligula is soon released, and quickly arranges for the expulsion of Jan-Erik, who accuses Caligula of murder, and finally strikes him in front of the principal of the school. Jan-Erik goes to stay in Bertha's apartment. The principal of the school comes to the apartment, and offers his assistance in helping Jan-Erik back on track. A shaken, weakened Caligula comes to the apartment after the principal has left, seeking some sort of forgiveness, but Jan-Erik rejects him and instead walks out into the day to a view that overlooks the whole city.",

Buster Dingle, who goes by the stage name \"Buzzy Bellew\", is a loud and goofy performer at the Pelican Club, while Edwin Dingle is a studious, quiet bookworm writing a history book. The two brothers have not seen each other for years. Buster becomes the witness to a murder committed by mob boss \"Ten Grand\" Jackson and is promptly murdered himself. He comes back as a ghost, calling on his long-lost brother for help to bring the killer to justice. As a result, the shy Edwin must take his brother's place until after his testimony is given. In the meantime, he has to dodge Jackson's hitmen and fill in for Buster at the nightclub. To help him out, Buster who cannot be seen or heard by anyone but Edwin possesses him, with outrageously goofy results. Edwin, possessed by Buzzy, performs a bit where he pretends to be a famous Russian singer allergic to flowers. A vase of flowers is nonetheless placed on a table near him, and his song, \"Otchi Chornya\", is frequently interrupted by his loud and goofy-sounding sneezes. The love interests of the brothers further complicate the situation; while the murdered Buster was engaged to entertainer Midge Mallon, librarian Ellen Shanley admires Edwin. In the end, Ellen marries Edwin, while Midge consoles herself by marrying the owner of the Pelican Club.",

    "Synopsis": "Johannes is a sailor who returns home after seven years of travel and finds Sally, the girl he once loved, and many memories resurface in him. Realizing that he still loves her, he declares it to her but Sally rejects him. Johannes walks wandering on the beach and thinks back to the past, to something that happened seven years ago during a marine recovery. Since Captain Blom, his father, is absent, Johannes, in order to keep the sailors under control, takes command of the operation. Meanwhile, Blom goes between one tavern and another and in one of these he starts a fight and, after courting a girl named Sally, he takes her away with him. Blom is later diagnosed with a serious eye disease that will lead to blindness. Sally goes to live in the Blom family's boat, but furious arguments break out between Johannes and his abusive father. Johannes and Sally fall in love and this causes Blom's anger to become even stronger. While Blom's wife tries to persuade her husband to return to her, Johannes and Sally make love in an old mill and Sally later confesses to the captain her love for Johannes. A heated discussion ensues in which Sally tells Blom that he is a total failure. During the resumption of the recovery operation, where Johannes works under the keel as a diver while Blom is in charge of the pump, the latter tries to kill his son by interrupting the flow of air that goes to the diving suit. Johannes is saved, but Blom, in a fit of madness, plunges the recovered wreck into the sea and destroys everything. When the police arrive to arrest him, he throws himself out of the window, nearly killing himself. After this shocking episode, Johannes embarks as a sailor and leaves for India, while Sally returns to sing and dance in the seedy club where she worked before. Before Johannes departs, he promises to take Sally away with him one day. Seven years later, where the film began, Johannes goes back to Sally and reminds her of his promise. Initially, Sally resists and tells Johannes she wants nothing to do with him. After much insistence by Johannes, Sally eventually agrees to go away with him and they both depart on a ship together.",

    "Synopsis": "Episcopal priest Father Lambert is shot dead on a Bridgeport, Connecticut street at night. The police, led by Chief Robinson, fail to immediately find the murderer. The case soon becomes a political hot potato, with the police accused of incompetence and the city's reform-minded administration attacked by the corrupt political machine that it had displaced. Robinson and prosecutor Henry Harvey face severe pressure by cheap political leaders, the press and the public to find the killer or otherwise seek outside help. Strenuous local efforts yield nothing. However, vagrant military veteran John Waldron is arrested in Ohio and meets the general description of the murder suspect. He is extradited to Connecticut and identified in a lineup. Waldron is interrogated for two days by the corrupt police until, suffering from severe sleep deprivation, he confesses. A gun that was in his possession is believed to be that which was used in the shooting, and witness testimony and other circumstantial evidence seem solid enough to guarantee conviction. Harvey questions Waldron and investigates the evidence and the witnesses. He develops serious doubts about Waldron's guilt. In court, Harvey states that a prosecutor must seek justice, not merely attempt to convict. He presents the flaws in the case before the judge and indicates that he intends to dismiss the charges. Suspecting that Harvey's plea is driven by political motives, the judge warns him that he will hold his actions to the highest scrutiny. Chief Robinson thwarts a lynch mob trying to seize Waldron outside of the court building. Harvey is threatened by reform party kingpin and real estate swindler Paul Harris, who seeks to blackmail him based on Harvey's wife's innocent contribution to a community fund for park land that Harris secretly owns. Harvey threatens to physically remove Harris from his home. At a preliminary hearing, Harvey presents detailed evidence that would lead to Waldron's exoneration. Meanwhile, a reporter conducts his own investigation into possible wrongdoing. In court, the reporter secretly threatens to reveal Harris' double dealing, and Harris commits suicide in the courtroom. Waldron is exonerated and the narrator explains that the murder was never solved and that the character of Henry Harvey was based upon Homer Cummings, who rose from state prosecutor to become the United States attorney general.",

    "Synopsis": "In Washington D.C., a former US Army soldier named Joseph Samuels is found dead in a hotel room. Police Captain Finlay suspects that the murderer may be among a group of demobilized servicemen had been with Samuels and his female companion Miss Lewis at a hotel bar the night of his death. One of the soldiers, former police officer Sgt. Montgomery, tells Finlay that he and his friend Floyd Bowers met Samuels at the hotel bar and went up to his apartment to find Samuels talking to Cpl. Arthur \"Mitch\" Mitchell. Soon upon their arrival, a heavily drunk Mitch left Samuels' apartment alone, then Montgomery and Floyd left a minute or so later. Montgomery claims that it was the last time they saw Samuels alive. Sgt. Peter Keeley, concerned that Mitch may be the prime suspect, investigates the murder himself, hoping to clear his friend's name. After helping Mitch escape from police capture, Keeley meets him in a movie theater, where Mitch recalls Montgomery arguing with Samuels inside his apartment. After Mitch left, he spent part of the night with Ginny Tremaine, a working girl he met in a dance hall. When Mitch woke up the next morning in Ginny's apartment, she was not there. After hearing a knock at the door, Mitch met an odd man, who offered to make him coffee, and claimed he was waiting for Ginny too. While the man looked for some cigarettes, Mitch hastily left the apartment. Meanwhile, Montgomery and Floyd meet in an apartment. Montgomery tells Floyd to stay out of sight and to keep their stories straight, that they had no argument with Samuels and left his apartment shortly after Mitch. Keeley knocks on their door and asks Floyd about the killing while Montgomery hides. After Keeley leaves, Montgomery – the actual killer – kills Floyd for refusing to stay out of sight, and then stages a hanging suicide. Escorted by Captain Finlay, Mitch's wife Mary visits Ginny at her apartment, hoping that Ginny will confess to spending the night with Mitch and prove he is innocent. Mary asks Finlay to wait outside, as a cop might make Ginny clam up. Ginny claims to have no knowledge of meeting Mitch, at which point Finlay enters the apartment to question her. Ginny recants and admits to knowing Mitch, but states that she never met him at her apartment. At this point, the odd man appears from a back room and tells Finlay that he remembers Mitch, thereby providing a partial alibi, but not for the estimated time of the murder. Back at the police station, Finlay questions Montgomery a second time, hoping to uncover the motive for Samuels' murder, but sends him on his way. With Keeley in his office, Finlay suspects that antisemitism was the likely motive for Samuels' murder, since Samuels was Jewish and no person involved otherwise knew him personally. Both suspect that Montgomery was responsible for killing both Samuels and Floyd, since he is clearly antisemitic. Finlay delivers a personal antiracist message to Keeley and a naïve soldier named Leroy, who was in Montgomery's unit, by recalling the death of his Irish grandfather during earlier historical bigotry. Winning over Leroy, Finlay sets a trap to catch Montgomery. Leroy tells a surprised Montgomery that Floyd wants to meet him and shows him an address he wrote down where he can find Floyd. Montgomery shows up at the apartment where he killed Floyd, presumably to check if he is still alive, and encounters Finlay and another cop. Finlay tells Montgomery he gave himself away as the address on the piece of paper was actually to a different building, nevertheless he came to the right apartment, proving he had been there before when he killed Floyd. Montgomery tries to escape but is shot dead by Finlay. After Montgomery is killed, Finlay and Keeley say their goodbyes. As Finlay drives away, Keeley offers to buy Leroy a cup of coffee.",

    "Synopsis": "<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot length should be between 400 and 700 words. This article is currently at 546.--> In Florida, while a large circus spends the off-season in its winter grounds, a flock of white storks delivers many babies to the animals. One elephant, Mrs. Jumbo, does not receive her baby, and keeps scanning the sky in hope. The next spring, the circus sets out on a new tour. A belated stork catches up with a moving train named Casey Jr. and drops off the expected baby elephant, Jumbo Jr. The other elephants are initially delighted, until they see the baby has revealed far-oversized ears, and mockingly nickname him \"Dumbo\". Mrs. Jumbo shows her baby great care and love, defending him from the others' abuse. Being clumsy due to his ears, Dumbo is made into a sideshow attraction. When some rowdy boys start to bully Dumbo and his ears, even breaking into his pen, the furious Mrs. Jumbo spanks their leader. The circus staff is drawn in by the commotion and sees Mrs. Jumbo throwing hay bales at spectator, the shocked staff remove Dumbo from the pen, causing Mrs. Jumbo to be further enraged, eventually dousing the circus's ringmaster in a water tub. She is subsequently deemed mad and locked up in a cage, while Dumbo is blamed for the incident by the elephants, and is still bullied by the others. After scaring off the other elephants, Timothy, a mouse that travels with the circus, befriends Dumbo and decides to make him a star. He whispers in the ringmaster's ear while the latter sleeps, convincing him to try a new stunt with Dumbo as the top of a pyramid of elephants. Dumbo trips on his ears during the show and knocks over the pyramid, injuring the others and causing the big top to collapse. After, all elephants exile Dumbo permanently as he is put in with the clowns' firemen act, regularly jumping from a \"burning building\" prop into a vat of pie filling. Despite his newfound popularity, he hates the new performance and is upset. Timothy decides to take Dumbo to see Mrs. Jumbo, but they cannot see each other's faces and can only intertwine trunks. Meanwhile, the clowns decide to increase the popularity of their fireman act by dangerously raising the platform Dumbo jumps from. In celebration of the plan, they drink champagne, and a bottle of it falls into a water vat. Crying after visiting his mother, Dumbo has an unsettling case of the hiccups, so Timothy takes him to the vat for some water, only to discover that the water contains champagne. Both of them get drunk, and hallucinate pink elephants. While recovering the next morning, Dumbo and Timothy are later discovered asleep high up in a tree by Jim Crow and his gang of crows. Initially making fun of Timothy's assertion that Dumbo flew with his ears while being drunk, the crows are soon moved by Dumbo's sad story. They decide to help Timothy, giving him a \"magic feather\" to help Dumbo fly. Holding the feather, Dumbo does indeed take off a second time. He and Timothy return to the circus with plans to surprise the audience. During the clowns' fire act, Dumbo jumps off the platform and prepares to fly. He drops the feather, but Timothy assures him it was only a psychological aid. As Dumbo successfully flies about the big top, much to the audience's delight, he throws a trunkful of peanuts to the other elephants as payback. Dumbo gains fame and fortune, Timothy becomes his new manager and signs him to a Hollywood contract, and Mrs. Jumbo is freed. She and Dumbo are given a private coach on Casey Jr., and the crows wave goodbye to the duo as they travel away.",

    "Synopsis": "A woman wanders through Los Angeles, saying little more than \"David\". Admitted to a hospital's psychiatric ward in a catatonic stupor, and interrogated by a doctor, she calls herself Louise Howell, and recounts her life in intermittent spurts, starting with her memory of her lover David Sutton playing Schumann for her, she saying, \"I want to have a monopoly on you.\" He does not return her passion, but returns her home in a boat, and tells her their relationship is over. She lives, and works as a nurse, at the lakeside home of the Grahams. Louise takes care of Pauline, the invalid wife of Dean Graham. Pauline is irascible and venomous, and thinks Louise is having an affair with her husband; Louise wants to leave. Later, the police trawl the lake and find Pauline's body. Dean says she killed herself. The Graham children Wynn (a young boy) and Carol (a college-age young woman) return home. A coroner's hearing is held, with a verdict of accidental death. Afterwards, Louise encounters Carol, who angrily says Pauline's letters said Louise was attractive to Dean. Carol wants Louise to leave; Dean, who has arrived, demands Carol apologize, and slaps her. David comes by, and says Dean's oil business needs him as an engineer; he is hired. Louise speaks to him and thinks he has another woman, which he denies. Louise goes with the Grahams to Washington, D.C., taking care of Wynn. David happens to be there, and Louise starts drinking and looks strained; he says he is out of love with her forever, and she slaps him. She says she'll quit her job, but Dean asks her to marry him; she agrees, even though she says she is not in love with him, which he accepts. Louise visits Carol at college, wanting to be liked by her; there is a reconciliation. At the wedding, the uninvited David arrives late, and speaks to the crying Carol, who says she asked him for marriage at 11 years of age, which he remembers. Louise warns him away from Carol, and tells him to leave. Later, Carol invites him over to their box at a piano recital; Louise has a distressed recollection of David at the piano, and leaves. At home, she has a lengthy hallucination: Carol returns with David, who kisses Carol. Louise confesses to killing Pauline. Carol says she'll tell Dean; Louise hits her, and she rolls down the stairs and dies. After the hallucination ends Carol then comes home for real, but not with David. Louise, feeling disturbed, visits a doctor under a false name, and is recommended to go to a psychiatrist, but walks out. She asks Dean for a divorce; Dean asks why, and Louise says Pauline hates her. On a vacation back at the lake house, Louise climbs to Pauline's bedroom, screams, and when Dean runs up there, Louise says Pauline is in the room, saying to her, \"Kill yourself, Louise\". Dean says she's dead, and turns on the light; Louise doesn't see her any more, but confesses to helping her kill herself. Dean says that was false, as Louise was in the village on her day off. Back at their regular home, Louise, happy to be free of Pauline's ghost, wants to go dancing; but she and Dean see David and Carol at the nightclub. Louise later lies to Carol that David really wants her, Louise. David drops by, and confronts Louise, who says Carol said she, Carol, is tired of David. Louise then admits lying, and that she's willing to do anything to keep David; he threatens to tell Dean about Louise and their past. Dean confronts Louise, and says a doctor will come see her; she gets angry that it's a mental specialist, though she agrees to talk to him. She sneaks away to David, and says she is worried about being institutionalized. David says he will call Dean, and that he is going away that night to marry Carol. Louise gets out a gun; he taunts her, and she shoots him repeatedly. She awakens at the hospital, and admits killing David. Dean visits, and the doctor says it is psychosis, as if she is possessed of devils, but he can restore her. He also says her tortured mind and delusion that she helped Pauline kill herself, made her present condition almost inevitable, and that if he had seen her sooner, her problems could have been averted. Re the upcoming trial about David's death, the doctor says Louise is not responsible for any of her actions. They go see the sleeping Louise, and the doctor says the healing process will be long and difficult, and she'll suffer a great deal before recovery. Dean pledges to help support his wife recover fully, no matter what.",

    "Synopsis": "Chuck Scott is a World War II veteran who is now a penniless drifter in Miami tormented by bizarre dreams. After finding a wallet and returning it to Eddie Roman, a vicious gangster, he is hired by Roman to be his driver. Roman tests his new driver, whom he nicknames Scotty, by assuming control of his car from the back seat. Scotty does not know that Roman has an accelerator in the rear passenger compartment. This bizarre trick unnerves Scotty and Roman's right-hand man Gino. Roman reveals himself as a tough gangster by killing any competition, and is harsh and controlling with his wife, Lorna. She goes for a ride every night, and one day she asks driver Scotty to take her to Havana, Cuba in exchange for $1,000. He consents and realizes that he is in love with her. When they reach Havana, they stop for a drink at a club, where Lorna is stabbed to death. All the evidence points to Scotty as the killer, including the fact that he had, earlier that day, apparently purchased the knife used in the murder. He realizes that he is being framed. A photograph from the club that proves Scotty's innocence is destroyed by Gino, who has come to Cuba to exact revenge against Lorna and Scotty. Scotty escapes police custody but is supposedly gunned down by Gino when he returns to the curio store from which the knife was purchased. Scotty's face is never shown during this scene. Scotty wakes in Miami on the night that he and Lorna are supposed to abscond to Havana. He is sweating profusely and immediately takes his pills, presumably prescribed to treat his posttraumatic stress disorder from battle. He remembers nothing, and visits the naval hospital to seek treatment from his doctor, Commander Davidson. Davidson urges him to try to remember why he was dressed as a driver, but Scotty is unable to do so. The two go drinking at the Florida Club. Lorna is shocked that Scotty abruptly quit his job and departed earlier that night, and she is locked in her room after Roman discovers her writing a letter to Scotty. Roman and Gino go to the Florida Club to cool down, unknowingly sitting across the club, and behind a partition, from Scotty. Davidson realizes that the woman whom Scotty loves is Roman's wife, but by this time, Scotty remembers where he was supposed to be and leaves to find Lorna. He rescues her and they head for the port, but Gino and Roman are also heading to the port after they discover that Scotty was seen there buying tickets earlier that morning. With Roman using his master accelerator to push the car's speed to 100 mph, the car crashes into an oncoming train, killing both gangsters. Scotty and Lorna are now free to sail to Cuba and be together.",

    "Synopsis": "Stage-struck Asa Yoelson wants to sing in burlesque performer Steve Martin's act. Cantor Yoelson, his father, refuses to consider it. After Asa runs away but is found in Baltimore, the Yoelsons grudgingly consent. Martin eventually gives him billing, under a new name: Al Jolson. Soon afterward, an entertainer named Tom Baron, who is in the same show as Martin and Jolson, passes out drunk, and Jolson goes on in his place. Jolson receives a job offer from minstrel-show master Lew Dockstader, who is in the audience, and Martin releases Jolson. Al succeeds with the minstrel troupe and is invited to join a Broadway show (thanks to Martin, behind the scenes). Al becomes the leading player and takes the show on tour. Al hires his old mentor Martin, now unemployed, to be his manager. (In real life, Jolson never had a manager with this name. Jolson had three managers over the course of his career- Steve Martin is a composite of all three.) Jolson's career prevents him spending much time at home. He had always thought that someday he would marry his childhood friend, Ann Murray, but she eventually accepts a proposal from Roy Anderson, another childhood friend. Soon afterward, Al meets up-and-coming dancer Julie Benson. It is love at first sight for Al, who proposes to her that night. (Al Jolson was actually married four times. The character Julie Benson is modeled on his third wife, Ruby Keeler.) Julie does not love him immediately, but Al refuses to take no for an answer, and she eventually agrees to consider it. After Al misses a show in order to attend the opening of Julie's first show, she realizes his feelings for her are genuine and they marry. Al electrifies the show world with his first feature film, The Jazz Singer, and eagerly signs for more movies. His wife wants to quit show business and settle down, but Al persuades her to continue with her career. Julie becomes a movie star, but eventually can't stand any more of Al's nonstop, show-biz lifestyle. Al realizes that the only way to keep Julie is to quit show business. Al refuses all job offers and absolutely will not sing, even for family and friends. Papa Yoelson persuades his son to join him in a song the music he and Mama Yoelson danced to at their wedding and Al gets caught up in it. They adjourn to a nightclub, where the audience demands a song. Al agrees to a single number but the crowd yells for more. Julie, seeing Al happier than he's been in years, leaves while he's performing. She walks out of the nightclub and out of his life, leaving Al to his first love: singing.",

    "film_title": "The Strange Love of Martha Ivers",
    "Synopsis": "thumb|thumbtime=15|The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946) On a rainy night in 1928 in a Pennsylvania factory town called Iverstown, thirteen-year-old Martha Ivers tries to run away from the guardianship of her wealthy aunt, Mrs. Ivers, with her friend, the street-smart, poor Sam Masterson. She is caught and taken home, where Martha's tutor, Walter O'Neil Sr., presents his timid son, Walter Jr., as the one responsible for Martha's capture. Walter privately tells Martha that despite what his father said, he was not the one who sent authorities on her track, and would never betray her. His father claimed this in order to ingratiate himself with the aunt. Scolded by her aunt, Martha defiantly states her name is not Ivers, but Smith, her father's name. During a power failure, Sam comes for her, but Martha's aunt hears her calling to him from downstairs. While Sam slips out unnoticed, Mrs. Ivers starts beating Martha's kitten with her cane. Martha wrestles the cane away from her aunt and strikes her across the head, causing her to fall down the stairs, accidentally killing her. When the power comes back on, Martha lies about the incident to Walter Sr. Even though Walter Jr. saw everything, he backs her up. The greedy Walter Sr. makes it clear to both Walter Jr. and Martha that he knows what happened but that as long as he and his son stand to benefit, he will play along. Sam leaves town. Seventeen years later, in 1946, Walter Sr. is now dead, and Walter Jr. is now Iverstown's district attorney and is married to Martha, who has used her inheritance to expand the Ivers milling empire. Their marriage is one-sided; he loves her, but Walter knows she does not love him, and knows that all she wants is control. Sam, having been a soldier and itinerant gambler while he was away, drives into the small town by chance and, after an accident, leaves his car to be repaired. While waiting, he goes to his old home, now a boarding house. He meets Antonia \"Toni\" Marachek, who has just been released from jail. She misses her bus, and they spend the night in adjoining rooms in a hotel. She is later picked up for violating her probation by not returning to her hometown. Sam asks Walter to use his influence to get Toni released. Walter is convinced Sam has blackmail in mind. When Martha reacts joyfully to seeing Sam, a jealous Walter forces Toni to set him up. Sam is beaten up and driven out of town, but he is too tough to be intimidated. When all else fails, Walter makes a half-hearted attempt to kill Sam himself but is easily disarmed. Walter inadvertently blurts out his fears of blackmail, only to learn that Sam had not witnessed the death. Through old newspapers Sam learns that Walter Sr. had presented Martha's version of the 1928 accidental murder to the police: that an intruder murdered Martha's aunt. With that leverage, Walter Sr. had made Martha marry his son. When the police identified a former employee of the aunt as the murderer, the two Walters and Martha helped convict him, and he was hanged. Only Walter junior has any qualms about this, which he still has, but the other two, particularly Martha, were too strong for him to go against them. Sam is torn between his old love and his new one with Toni. Although he eventually forgives Toni for betraying him, he and Martha spend an idyllic day together, rekindling his feelings for her. Martha breaks down and laments that he left without her all those years ago, taking her only chance for love and freedom with him. Walter gets drunk and arranges to meet Sam to settle matters. Martha finds out about the meeting. When Walter drunkenly falls down the stairs, Martha urges Sam to kill her unconscious husband. Sam instead brings Walter around. Martha pulls out a gun and threatens to shoot Sam in \"self-defense\" as an intruder. Sam tells her it would work if she could get Walter to corroborate her story. Saying he does not believe she will shoot him, Sam turns his back on her and leaves. Martha drops the gun and Walter picks it up. Walter thinks she still loves Sam. Martha says she was afraid Walter would leave her. He embraces and kisses her as she tells him it can be just like nothing ever happened. Walter pulls out the gun and points at her midriff. She puts her thumb over his finger on the trigger and presses. As she is dying, she defiantly states her name is not Martha Ivers, but Martha Smith. Outside, Sam hears the shot. He runs toward the mansion and sees Walter holding Martha's body. Walter then shoots himself. In the final scene, Sam and Toni drive away from Iverstown. Sam says to Toni, \"Don't look back, you know what happened to Lot’s wife.” Toni says, “Whose wife?” And Sam says, “Sam’s wife.” Toni smiles and says, “Sam’s wife!”",

    "Synopsis": "The movie opens with the camera panning over a Heaven somewhere beyond the sky. The residences of great showmen gone to their eternal reward are shown: Shakespeare, whose home looks like the Globe Theater; P.T.Barnum, whose residence in the afterlife resembles a circus Big Top; and Florenz Ziegfeld, whose home's entrance is reminiscent of the theater where he staged the Ziegfeld Follies on Broadway. Talking to the audience, Ziegfeld guides the viewers along a wall with three-dimensional paintings or shadow boxes containing dolls that look like the stars he cast in his Follies over the years. The film dissolves into a stop-motion puppet sequence as Ziegfeld provides a voice-over of the opening of one of his shows. Following this, he steps out onto a balcony, musing how he wishes he could stage just one more Follies, with current and past stars in the cast. A Higher Power causes a cigar-sized crayon and a sheet of parchment to appear, and Ziegfeld begins to write. As he does so, the skits and performance numbers appear on the screen.",

    "Synopsis": "After surviving a Nazi POW camp where comrades were murdered by guards during an escape attempt, Frank Enley is respected for his fine character and good works in the small California town of Santa Lisa, where he, his young wife Edith and baby had settled after moving from the East. What his wife does not know is that Frank moved them in an attempt to escape the fall-out from events in that WWII prison camp. Frank has a nemesis, Joe Parkson, once his best friend, who lived through the ordeal and was left with a crippled leg. Unable to convince Joe not to make an escape attempt, Frank had alerted the SS Nazi camp commander to the prisoners' plan, taking the camp commandant at his word that he would \"go easy\" on the men. The prisoners were bayonetted and left to die, and only Joe survived by playing dead. Joe is now determined to exact justice on Frank, whose location he has learned from a newspaper story commending Enley for his civic endeavors. Joe's girlfriend, Ann Sturgess, knows everything about her man, but cannot dissuade him from his passion to right past wrongs by seeing Frank dead. Joe confronts Edith at their house and tells her the truth about Frank. Doggedly pursued by Joe, Frank goes to a trade convention at a Los Angeles hotel. Edith shows up to hear the truth straight from her husband, before fleeing back home. Joe finds Frank and they scuffle. Frank runs through downtown Los Angeles and ends up on Skid Row, where he is picked up in a bar by a woman, Pat, who introduces him to a shady lawyer, Gavery, and a thug for hire, Johnny. A drunken Frank gives Johnny the information he needs to lure Joe into an ambush at the Santa Lisa train station. Waking from his drunken binge, Frank regrets the deal. He goes home and tries to persuade Edith that it is all over. While she is seeing to their child, he leaves and goes to the station to warn Joe. Johnny is waiting with a gun, but as he fires, Frank jumps in front of Joe and is hit. Frank manages to grab Johnny as he speeds off in his car, causing it to crash into a lamppost, killing Johnny. Frank falls into the street near the fiery crash and dies. Joe, realizing what Frank has done, kneels by his old captain and tells the surrounding crowd that he will be the one to tell Frank's wife about her husband's death.",

    "film_title": "An Act of Murder",
    "Synopsis": "Calvin Cooke, a principled but stubborn judge, presides over a murder case in which lawyer David Douglas is unsuccessful in proving that his client's state of mind was a mitigating factor. Cooke's daughter Ellie complains to her mother Cathy about how unyielding her father can be; Cathy insists that he is a loving husband. Anyway, it is their 20th wedding anniversary and she is planning to celebrate with friends at their house. Cooke does not know that Ellie (herself a law student) and Douglas are romantically involved until Douglas arrives during the party to take her on a date. Cooke and Douglas exchange sharp words of disagreement about their philosophies of the law. At the party, Cathy talks to Dr. Morrison, an expert neurologist and friend of the family, about her intermittent symptoms of weakness and headaches. At his office, Morrison performs a series of tests and then consults other experts. Rather than tell her the truth, Morrison contacts her husband. Cathy has an inoperable brain tumor <!-- that word is not spoken, but one of the doctors says \"neoplastic\" --> and will suffer increasingly until it kills her. Cooke agrees, rather than spoiling her remaining days, to keep the information secret. The doctor gives him a bottle of pills called Demarine for pain relief, strongly warning him about the maximum dosage, and a prescription for more. Cooke, who previously said he was too busy with cases to take Cathy on a second honeymoon as she wished, now agrees to go at once. But her condition worsens rapidly, including excruciatingly painful headaches. Cooke gives her a dose of Demarine, pretending it is aspirin. While he is calling the doctor from a pay phone so Cathy will not hear, a dog is run over in the street, and a police officer ends its suffering with a gunshot. Cooke, evidently feeling disgust at similar thoughts of his own, discards the remaining pills. Cathy, looking through their luggage for toiletries, accidentally discovers the doctor's written diagnosis and prescription. When Cooke returns to the room, she says she is feeling better but would like to return home. In the car, her symptoms return. They stop at a gas station to have a car problem repaired and Cooke asks urgently about the nearest drugstore. Back on the road, Cathy collapses in the car. Cooke can stand it no more. He deliberately drives off an embankment, not caring if he is also killed. He survives, confesses that he crashed on purpose, and in keeping with his philosophy, demands to be prosecuted for murder. At Ellie's request, Douglas agrees to defend Cooke. He requests an autopsy in case Cathy had actually died from her illness before the crash. The finding is a surprise: she did die before the crash, but from a Demarine overdose. Douglas shows that she had had the prescription filled before the drive home, and taken the drug while at the gas station. The trial judge then dismisses the murder charge, but declares that Cooke knew very well that what he tried to do was wrong, and should consider himself morally guilty. Cooke agrees, and announces that in expiation, if allowed to remain a judge, he will now rule on the basis that similarly a person can be legally guilty but morally innocent&mdash;just what Douglas and Ellie have been asking for.",

    "Synopsis": "In an effort to escape the law, two small-time thieves, Francesca and Walter, hide among the crowds of female workers heading to the rice paddies in the Province of Vercelli in the upper reaches of Piedmont in the Po Valley. While attempting to board the train for the fields, the pair runs into Silvana, a peasant rice worker. Francesca boards the train with Silvana, who introduces her to the planters' way of life. Francesca does not have a work permit, and struggles with the other \"illegals\" to find a place on the rice fields. After initial resistance from documented workers and bosses, the illegals are allowed a place in the fields. At work in the fields, Silvana and Francesca meet a soon-to-be-discharged soldier, Marco, who unsuccessfully tries to attract Silvana's interest. Toward the end of the working season, Walter arrives at the rice farm and becomes involved in a plot to steal a large quantity of rice. Excited by his criminal lifestyle, Silvana becomes attracted to Walter. She causes a diversion to help him carry out the heist, but Francesca and Marco manage to stop Walter and his accomplices. Francesca and Silvana face each other, armed with hand-guns. Francesca confronts Silvana and explains that she has been heartlessly manipulated by Walter. In response, Silvana turns her gun on Walter and kills him. Soon afterwards, her guilt leads her to commit suicide. As the other rice workers depart, they pay tribute to her by sprinkling rice upon her body.",

    "Synopsis": "An express messenger rides to Vienna and reports at a ball given by Prince Lichnowsky that Napoleon Bonaparte is approaching Vienna with his troops. The news spreads like wildfire in the city and also reaches Beethoven, who, together with his friends, is sitting in the tavern. Beethoven is very enthusiastic about the ideals embodied by Napoleon after the French Revolution. He hurries home to write a powerful and glorious symphony - which later becomes famous as Beethoven's \"Eroica\" - for Napoleon. After the symphony is successful, two messengers from Napoleon come to see Beethoven. They request Beethoven to participate in a reception given by the French emperor. Favouring the glamour, Napoleon has elaborated detailed clothing instructions for Beethoven. Beethoven is disappointed by his idol's superficiality and deletes the dedication to Napoleon from the title page of the symphony. For his safety, Beethoven travels to Hungary and finds quarters at the aristocratic home of his pupil Therese von Brunswick and her cousin Giulietta Guicciardi. Beethoven falls in love with Giulietta, who is even willing to leave her fiancé for Beethoven. This interpretation of Beethoven's life is distorted, however, as it was in 1800, four years earlier, that Beethoven actually met Giulietta. In the film story, Therese thinks that, due to his talent, it is not Beethoven's destiny to have a fulfilling relationship with a woman. Beethoven not only worries about his nephew Karl whom he thinks is leading a dissolute life and is under his mother's harmful influence but also becomes aware of a worsening of his hearing abilities. As Beethoven despairs of a reason why God would want to deprive him of his hearing, Beethoven's friend Amenda replies that Beethoven's destiny is to compose a type of music never heard before. It is saddening for Beethoven to learn during rehearsals for his opera \"Fidelio\" that the musicians cannot follow his \"conducting\", and in fact are actually following their music director instead. In a depressed mood, Beethoven goes home and once more speaks with God, as Amenda's words come to his mind. When Therese comes to look after him, he comes to terms with his destiny and begins to compose again.",

    "Synopsis": "Gino Monetti is a rags-to-riches Italian-American banker in New York City whose questionable business practices result in a number of criminal charges. Three of his four grown sons, the ambitious Joe, playboy Tony, and physically imposing Pietro (a budding prize-fighter), unhappy at their domineering father's dismissive treatment of them, refuse to help Gino when he is put on trial. Joe is especially angry—he has to support a wife with expensive tastes on $65.00 a week (about $1500 in 2025). Max, a lawyer, is the only son who stays loyal to his father. He believes Gino has done nothing that warrants punishment by jail time, and serves as Gino's attorney during the trial. After Gino signs ownership of his bank over to his wife Theresa as a temporary protective measure, Joe persuades his mother to sign it over to him and seizes control. Gino is relegated to an early retirement with a meager monthly allowance. The three brothers conspire to send Max to jail as well. When Max tells Joe of his plan to bribe a sympathetic juror to ensure a mistrial for Gino, Joe arranges for the police to catch him in the act. Max is disbarred and sentenced to seven years in prison; Max's fiancé Maria Domenico breaks off their engagement to marry Tony, but Irene Bennett, a former client of Max's whom he fell in love with, waits for him. Meanwhile, Gino's trial ends in an acquittal, but he remains humiliated by Joe, Tony, and Pietro's betrayal and is directionless without his bank to run. He drinks and smokes heavily, and writes countless letters to Max decrying his other sons' mistreatment of them both. Irene urges Gino to stop sending the letters, knowing that Gino is trying to divide the brothers and provoke Max to take revenge, but Gino refuses. Eventually, Gino dies, and Max is let out of prison for a half-day to attend the funeral. There, Max vows revenge on his brothers and ignores his mother's pleas to let go of the hate that Gino had cultivated between them. Max returns to the family home after completing his sentence, intent on destroying his brothers and their bank, but has a sudden change of heart when he realizes that his father was the source of the family conflict. Max is then confronted by his brothers, who still believe Max will follow through on his vow. After a fight in which Max is incapacitated, Joe orders Pietro to throw Max off their house's balcony to his death. Pietro hesitates, and Joe begins insulting Pietro in the same way their father always had, prompting Pietro to turn on Joe instead. Max saves Joe from Pietro's wrath by convincing Pietro that if he kills Joe, he would be doing exactly as their father would have wanted. Max then leaves his brothers to re-join Irene and travel to San Francisco, where they plan to start a new life together.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1922, Scott Mason Carter graduates from Chase Medical School in Chicago and marries Marcia. Both are African American but are light-skinned enough to be mistaken for whites. Scott has landed an internship, but his fellow graduate, the dark-skinned Jesse Pridham, wonders if he will have to work as a Pullman porter until there is an opening in a black hospital. When Scott goes to Georgia, the black hospital director tells him that the board of directors has decided to give preference to Southern applicants and rescinds the job offer when he sees him. The couple live in Boston with Marcia's parents, who have been passing as white. Her father and some of their black friends suggest they do the same. Instead, Scott continues to apply as a Negro and is repeatedly rejected. Scott finally yields, quits his job making shoes, and masquerades as white for a one-year internship in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. There, Scott responds to an emergency. At an isolated lighthouse, he has to operate immediately on a sport fisherman who is bleeding to death. His patient turns out to be Dr. Walter Bracket, the well-known director of a local clinic. Impressed, Dr. Bracket offers Scott a position as town doctor in Keenham (a fictionalized version of Keene, New Hampshire), replacing Bracket's recently deceased father. Scott declines, explaining that he is a Negro. Dr. Bracket, though he admits he would not have made the offer had he known, recommends Scott take the job without revealing his race. With his wife pregnant, Scott reluctantly agrees. Scott and Marcia are relieved when their newborn son appears as white as they do. Scott slowly gains the trust and respect of the residents. By 1942, when the United States enters World War II, the Carters are pillars of the community. Their son, Howard, attends the University of New Hampshire, while daughter Shelly is in high school. Scott goes to Boston once a week to work at the Charles Howard Clinic, which Jesse Pridham and he established for patients of all races. The Carters have kept their secret even from their own children. When Howard invites a black classmate, Arthur Cooper, to visit, Shelly worries aloud what her friends will think about a \"coon\" staying in their home. Scott sternly orders her never to use that word again. When Arthur goes to a party with Howard, some guests make bigoted remarks behind his back. Scott and Howard enlist in the United States Navy, but after a background check, Scott's commission as a lieutenant commander is suddenly revoked for \"failure to meet physical conditions\". The only position open to blacks in the Navy is steward. The Carters have no choice but to tell their children the truth. Howard breaks up with his white girlfriend. He rents a room in Harlem and roams the streets. When Shelly's boyfriend Andy asks her about the \"awful rumor\" about her family, Shelly confesses that it is true. He asks her to the school dance anyway, but she turns him down. In Harlem, Howard investigates screams and finds two black men fighting. When one pulls out a gun, Howard intervenes. The gun goes off and the gunman flees, but Howard is taken into custody. To a sympathetic black police lieutenant, Howard explains, \"I came here to find out what it's like to be a Negro.\" Arthur Cooper collects his friend from the police station. Howard and his father return to Keenham. When they attend their regular Sunday church service, the minister preaches a sermon of tolerance, then notes that the Navy has just ended its racist policy. The narrator announces that Scott Carter remains the doctor for a small New Hampshire town.",

    "Synopsis": "Clive Riordan, a wealthy London psychiatrist, learns that his wife Storm is romantically involved with Bill Kronin, an American. He resolves to exact revenge on both by committing the perfect murder of Kronin. After kidnapping Kronin at gunpoint, Riordan keeps him prisoner for months, chained up in a hidden room accessed from a nearby garage in a bomb damaged part of London. The authorities mount a search for the missing American, which with no leads, dissipates after a few weeks. Riordan theorises that keeping the American alive for months until his disappearance is all but forgotten will allow him to be killed without anyone suspecting a connexion to himself, the 'perfect' part covering the motive and opportunity. During one of his daily visits to bring food and supplies, Riordan is unknowingly trailed by his dog Monty. The doctor reveals to Kronin that he plans to kill him and dissolve his corpse in an acid bath, fearing that Monty might lead others to the secret location, Riordan resolves to kill the dog with the bath prepared for Kronin, but Kronin manages to save the dog and keeps him safe from Riordan. The doctor had also been bringing hot water bottles full of acid to fill the bath, the perfect way to dispose of a body. Riordan's plan appears to be succeeding until Superintendent Finsbury from Scotland Yard visits the doctor's office. Finsbury claims to be investigating the missing dog, but as the conversation drifts to the Kronin case it becomes clear that Finsbury harbours suspicions about Riordan. After a few chats with Riordan, Finsbury realises he has been having regular company with an American after hearing him use the Americanism, 'thanks, pal.' While overhearing a conversation between Storm and Finsbury Riordan decides it’s time to act and poisons Kronin, only to discover that he has trained Monty to empty the acid bath by pulling the plug chain. The police find Riordan’s car in his garage, which leads them to the hidden room and Kronin’s body.

Her voiceover recalls her excitement and delight at the first holiday with Howard for years. She is half asleep when a man is shown into the adjoining room. She remembers a New Year's party, 9 years before: We see that it is that same man, Steven. Driving home from the party, Mary remembers her affair with Steven and how much in love they were. She dreams of how she refused his proposal because she “wants to belong to herself.” Howard goes to Germany and Italy on a business trip. Steven calls Mary. She goes to his apartment for lunch. The sun is setting as he recalls their love and they kiss. They begin an affair, not thinking about consequences. Howard returns. They agree he should know. Meanwhile, Howard is preoccupied with a pair of theatre tickets that Mary left behind. He goes to the theatre and sees the seats are empty. Steven brings Mary home; Howard invites him in for a drink. Mary sees Howard's program. Steven tells Howard they have always been in love. Mary tells Steven to leave. In the morning he receives a letter from Mary. He finds the Justin house full of trunks and dust sheets. He confronts Howard, who tells him he does not really know Mary. They are leaving for Washington. Mary confirms what Howard said and runs upstairs, weeping. “That was 9 years ago,” Mary's voiceover returns, wondering what she would have done if she had known he was the man in the adjoining room at the Hotel Splendide. They meet at breakfast. Steven has a half-day before returning to London. They go by boat and cable car to picnic on a mountain. Steven reveals that he has two children with his wife. Mary asks him if he is happy, and seems happier herself that she is. Mixed expressions tell of regrets. When they return from the mountain, Howard, who has arrived early, sees them disembarking together.

His pride is further hurt when Mary rushes by him to the terrace, not realising he is there, to wave goodbye enthusiastically to Steven.

Mary decides she must save Steven and tells him that Howard has withdrawn the divorce. She tells Howard that nothing happened in the Hotel Splendide. She knew nothing of the adjoining room. Howard tells her the divorce is not about that. He had not expected love but only affection and some loyalty. Instead he was given 'the love you'd give a dog, the kindness you'd show a beggar, and the loyalty of a bad servant'. He yells at Mary to get out, but quickly calms down and retracts what he said in genuine remorse, revealing that he has developed the type of romantic love for Mary that he has always disdained, but his back is turned and Mary has already left. Mary runs into a London Underground station. Standing on a platform, she stares at the tracks, drawing dangerously close to the platform edge. Just as she is about to leap, someone catches her round the waist. It is Howard. She trembles and weeps as he holds her. They go home.",

    "Synopsis": "Captain Herman Suvorin is a Russian officer of the engineers in St Petersburg in 1806. He constantly watches the other officers gamble at faro, but never plays himself because he is averse to the risk of losing his money. Herman overhears gossip among several military officers about the aging Countess Ranevskaya, who knows the secret of winning at cards and won a large sum of money after selling her soul, several decades earlier in her youth. Later Herman purchases a book titled The Strange Secrets of the Count de Saint Germain purporting to tell the true stories of people who sold their souls for wealth, power or influence. One chapter of the book describes how in 1746 a \"Countess R***\" obtained the secret from the count and subsequently won a fortune from gambling. The countess had to promise not to disclose the secret. Herman assumes \"Countess R***\" is Countess Ranevskaya. The countess (now very elderly) has a young ward, Lizaveta Ivanovna. Andrei, a military officer of noble birth and a friend of Herman, encounters Lizaveta in a bird market and decides to become her suitor. At the same time, Herman tries to seduce Lizaveta with love letters in order to persuade her to let him into the countess's house. Andrei discovers Herman's advances, breaks off their friendship and warns Lizaveta that Herman is dangerous. Lizaveta rejects Andrei's warning. Herman gains access to the house and accosts the countess, demanding the secret. He offers to assume her sin in exchange. He repeats his demands, but she does not speak. He draws a pistol and threatens her, and the old lady dies of fright. Herman then flees to the apartment of Lizaveta in the same building. There he confesses to frightening the countess to death. He defends himself by saying that the pistol was not loaded. He escapes from the house with the aid of Lizaveta, who is disgusted to learn that his professions of love were a mask for greed. Herman attends the funeral of the countess, and is terrified to see the deceased open her eyes in the coffin and look at him. Later that night, Herman reads a chapter of his book entitled \"The Dead Will Give Up Their Secrets\". Subsequently, the ghost of the countess visits his apartment. The ghost names the secret of the three cards (three, seven, ace), but orders him to marry Lizaveta as a condition. The next day Herman tries to reconcile with Lizaveta, but she again rejects him. Herman takes his entire savings to a gaming salon. When he arrives, Andrei challenges him to a duel. Herman accepts on condition that Andrei play a hand of faro with him; Andrei accepts. Herman bets all his savings on the three of spades and wins. Herman and Andrei agree on a second round, which Herman wins on the seven of spades. A third round is played. Herman spots the ace of spades in his hand in front of the queen of spades. Herman places his selected card face down on the table and bets on the ace—but when cards are shown, he finds he has bet on the queen of spades and loses everything. Showing compassion, Andrei escorts a very distraught Herman from the gambling table, who mumbles repeatedly \"three, seven, ace … three, seven, queen\". Lizaveta and Andrei celebrate their future happiness together by fulfilling Lizaveta's dream of purchasing every bird in the bird market and setting them all free.",

    "Synopsis": "Bill \"Stoker\" Thompson, a 35-year-old has-been boxer, is about to take on a 23-year old, gangster-backed opponent called Tiger Nelson, at the Paradise City Arena. His wife, Julie, fears that this fight may be his last and wants him to forfeit the match. Tiny, Stoker's manager, is sure he will continue to lose fights, so he takes money for a \"dive\" from a mobster. He is so certain of Stoker's failure that he does not inform the boxer of the set-up. Stoker and Julie passionately debate whether he should participate in the fight. Julie tells him that she has a headache and won't attend. Stoker says that winning tonight's fight might let him \"get a top spot\" in his next fight, a fight which might pay him $500 or $600. A $500 prize could allow them to buy a cigar stand or invest in another boxer, Tony Martinez, and start a new life. Julie says she cares more about his well-being than money, but Stoker responds: \"If you're a fighter, you gotta fight.\" After Stoker departs for the arena, Julie continues to struggle with her fear and desire to support his boxing. Ultimately she doesn't use her ticket to the event, and instead roams the streets surrounding the arena. At the beginning of the fourth round of what is a vicious match with the much younger and heavily favored Tiger Nelson, Stoker learns about the fix. Even though he is told that Little Boy, a feared gangster, is behind the set-up, he refuses to give up the fight. Stoker wins the vocal support of blood-thirsty fans who had at first rooted against him. He eventually defeats Nelson. Little Boy exacts revenge by having him beaten in an alley outside the arena. In spite of his gameness against the thugs he is overcome and has his hand irreparably smashed with a brick. He staggers out of the alley and collapses into Julie's arms. \"I won tonight,\" he tells her, both of them realizing he can never fight again. \"Yes,\" she answers. \"You won tonight. We both won tonight.\"",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- MOS:FILMPLOT advises plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. Please do not expand this section any further. Please do not remove this message. --> Holly Martins, an American author of Western pulp novels, arrives in the British sector of Allied-occupied Vienna seeking Harry Lime, a childhood friend who has offered him a job. However, Martins is told that Lime was killed by a car while crossing the street. At Lime's funeral, Martins meets two Royal Military Police officers, part of the ICPO: Sergeant Paine, a fan of Martins' novels, and Major Calloway. Afterward, Martins is asked to lecture at a book club a few days later. He then meets a friend of Lime's, \"Baron\" Kurtz, who tells Martins that he and another friend, Popescu, carried Lime to the side of the street after the accident, and that, before he died, Lime asked them to take care of Martins and Lime's girlfriend, actress Anna Schmidt. As Martins and Anna query Lime's death, they realise that accounts differ as to whether Lime was able to speak before his death, and how many men carried away the body. The porter at Lime's apartment tells them that he saw a third man helping. He offers to give Martins more information but is murdered before they can speak again; Martins and Anna flee the scene after a mob begins to suspect him of the murder. When Martins confronts Major Calloway and demands that Lime's death be investigated, Calloway reveals that Lime was stealing penicillin from military hospitals, diluting it, and then selling it on the black market, injuring or killing countless people. Martins agrees to drop his investigation and leave. An inebriated Martins visits Anna and confesses his feelings for her. A man crosses the street towards her front door, but moves away after seeing Martins at the window. After leaving, Martins walks the streets until he notices Anna's cat and realises someone is watching from a darkened doorway. In a momentary flash of light, Martins sees that the man is Lime. Martins calls out, but Lime flees and vanishes. Martins summons Calloway, who realises that Lime has escaped through the city's sewers to the Soviet sector. The British police exhume Lime's coffin and discover that the body is that of a hospital orderly who had been assisting him. Anna, who is Czech, is to be sent to the Soviet sector after the British police discover that she has a forged Austrian passport, and is questioned again by Calloway. Martins goes to Kurtz and asks to see Lime. Lime and Martins meet and talk as they ride the Wiener Riesenrad. Lime speaks cynically of the insignificance of his victims' lives and the personal gains to be earned from the city's chaos and deprivation. Martins realises that Lime sold Anna out to the Soviet authorities for his own benefit. Lime obliquely threatens Martins as now the only 'proof' that Lime is alive. Lime then offers Martins a chance to join in on his scheme before leaving quickly. Calloway asks Martins to help arrest Lime; he agrees provided that Calloway will arrange for Anna to leave Vienna rather than be handed over to the Soviets. The British authorities arrange for Anna to take a train to Paris, but she spots Martins, who has come to observe her departure, at the station. After persuading Martins to reveal the plan to capture Lime, she leaves in order to warn him. Exasperated, Martins decides to leave Vienna; on the way to the airport, Calloway stops at a hospital to show Martins children dying of meningitis who were treated with Lime's diluted penicillin, which convinces him to stay and assist in capturing Lime. Lime arrives at a café in the international zone to meet Martins, but Anna is able to warn him that the police are closing in. He flees into the sewer, with the police following him underground. Lime shoots and kills Sgt Paine, but Calloway shoots and badly wounds Lime. Lime drags himself up a cast-iron stairway to a street grating but cannot lift it. Martins, armed with Paine's gun, runs after Lime finding him beneath the grating where they stare at each other. Calloway, realising Martins has chased Lime, shouts that Martins must not take any chances and shoot on sight. Lime nods his head slightly at Martins. Calloway follows down the tunnel as a single shot is heard. Martins attends Lime's second funeral at the risk of missing his flight out of Vienna. He waits on the road to the cemetery to speak with Anna, but she walks past without glancing in his direction.",

Contrary to company rules, he begins secretly dating co-worker Alice Tripp. Alice believes George's Eastman name will bring her advantages. George is invited by Charles to a social event, where George meets socialite Angela Vickers. They have a mutual attraction and fall in love. Just as George enters the intoxicating and care-free lifestyle his new life with Angela brings, Alice announces she is pregnant, and unable to procure an abortion, expects George to marry her. George puts Alice off and continues spending more time with Angela without Alice's knowledge. George is invited to Angela's family lake house over Labor Day and tells Alice the visit will advance his career. Alice discovers George's lie after seeing a newspaper photograph of George and Angela boating with friends. Alice calls George at the Vickers home and threatens to come there and reveal herself unless he leaves and returns to her. Shaken, George tells his hosts his mother is sick and he must leave. The next morning, George and Alice drive to City Hall to get married, but it is closed for Labor Day. George is relieved, and remembering Alice cannot swim, begins forming a plan to drown her in the lake by feigning an accident. Alice unsuspectingly agrees to the lake venture. Arriving at the lake, George attempts to cover for the upcoming murder by falsely stranding his car in the woods and renting a rowboat under a false name. While they are out on the lake, Alice talks about her dreams concerning their happy future together with their child. As George apparently takes pity on her, Alice tries to stand up in the boat, causing it to capsize, and Alice drowns. George escapes, swims to shore, behaves suspiciously when he comes across campers on his way back to the car, and eventually drives to the Vickers' lodge. He fails to report the accident. Alice's body is discovered, and her death is treated as a homicide as the evidence against George begins to mount. Just as Angela's father approves Angela's marriage to him, George is arrested and charged with Alice's murder. George's furtive actions before and after Alice's death condemn him. His denials are futile, and he is found guilty of murder and sentenced to death in the electric chair. Near the end, he agrees when the priest suggests that although he did not kill Alice, he did not act to save her because he was thinking of Angela. The priest then states that in his heart, it was murder. Angela visits George in prison, saying that she will always love him, and George slowly marches toward his execution.",

    "Synopsis": "At the Sarah Siddons Award ceremony honoring rising actress Eve Harrington, narration from acerbic theatre critic Addison DeWitt introduces the attendees and hints that there is more to Eve's story. The narration switches to Karen Richards, wife of playwright Lloyd Richards. She recalls the previous October, when she introduced Eve to aging Broadway star Margo Channing, who was starring in a play written by Lloyd. Eve tells Karen, Lloyd, and Margo's maid Birdie that she followed Margo's last theatrical tour to New York City after seeing her perform in San Francisco. She tells of her impoverished childhood and losing her husband in the South Pacific during World War II, and, moved by Eve's story, Margo takes her into her home as her assistant. Eve quickly manipulates her way into Margo's life as both secretary and adoring fan. Margo is also concerned about her romantic relationship with Bill Sampson, eight years her junior, who is directing a film in California. Without telling Margo, Eve arranges a midnight long-distance phone call from Margo to Bill on his birthday. Eve hopes the unexpected late call will show Bill that Margo forgot his birthday and also sends her own greeting. Margo realizes that Eve set her up and asks producer Max Fabian to hire Eve at his office to get her away from Bill; instead, Eve has Karen convince Fabian to make Eve Margo's understudy without Margo's knowledge. thumb|The film's trailer As Margo's irritation grows, Karen sympathizes with Eve, believing that Margo is overdramatizing her resentment towards her. Hoping to humble Margo, Karen conspires for her to miss a performance so Eve can perform in her place. Eve secretly invites the city's theater critics, including Addison, to attend the performance. Eve's performance is a triumph. Later that night, Eve attempts to seduce Bill, but he rejects her. Addison interviews Eve for a column, which harshly criticizes Margo for resisting younger talent. Eve apologizes to Lloyd for the things said in the article, and subtly convinces him to consider her instead of Margo for the lead role, Cora, in his next play. Margo and Bill announce their engagement while dining out with Lloyd and Karen. Eve, who had been dining at the same restaurant with Addison, summons Karen to the ladies' room. After first appearing regretful, she delivers an ultimatum: Karen must recommend her to Lloyd to play Cora or she will have Addison expose Karen's part in Margo's missed performance in his newspaper column. When Karen returns to the table—to her relief—Margo surprisingly announces that she does not wish to play Cora. Margo admits that she is too old for the ingénue role, and her impending marriage means that the theater no longer has to be her entire life. Eve is cast as Cora, despite the objections of Bill, who is directing the play. Just before the out-of-town opening, Eve tells Addison that she had seduced and plans to marry Lloyd so that he can write plays for her to star in. Angered by Eve's audacity, Addison reveals he knows her backstory is false; her real name is Gertrude Slescynski, she never went to San Francisco, she was never married, and she was paid to leave town over an affair with her married boss. He blackmails Eve, forbidding her from trying to marry Lloyd and saying she now \"belongs\" to him. The story catches up to the opening scene; months later, Eve is a Broadway star headed for Hollywood. While accepting the Sarah Siddons Award, Eve thanks Margo, Bill, Lloyd, and Karen, who react with indifference. Eve skips the after-party and returns home, where she encounters Phoebe, who claims to be a teenage fan who slipped into her apartment and fell asleep. Eve is angry but softens after Phoebe professes her adoration and ingratiates herself. Eve is considering inviting her to stay over rather than take the long subway ride back home when the doorbell buzzes. Phoebe offers to answer the door and recognizes Addison, who has brought Eve's award back from the taxi cab where she left it. Addison quickly realizes that Phoebe isn't her real name and that she, like Eve, has her sights on stardom. Phoebe lies to Eve that a taxi driver had dropped off the award. When she is alone, Phoebe puts on Eve's elegant cloak and poses in front of a floor-length mirror, holding the award and bowing.",

    "Synopsis": "During World War II, American sergeant Larry Nevins is blinded by a German sniper while fighting in North Africa. He is taken to a Pennsylvania hospital for other blinded soldiers, where he struggles to accept his disability. Though initially despondent, Larry is taught to orient himself and walk the grounds and in town by memorization and with use of a cane. He befriends Joe Morgan, another blinded veteran, and Judy, a local bank teller who volunteers by socializing with disabled soldiers. One day, Larry, unaware that Joe is black, utters a racial slur, causing a rift between Larry and the others. Meanwhile, he progresses well in his recovery, passing a crucial test to see how well he can handle himself on the street. He is cleared for furlough, so Judy takes him to spend a weekend at her sister's nearby cabin, where he fishes and is entertained by her family. From Judy's brother-in-law, Larry learns of a very successful blind lawyer, giving him hope for the future. After dinner, Judy reveals her love for him. Larry tells her that he needs more security and family support and already has a fiancée in his Florida hometown. Somewhat dispirited, he returns home and faces difficulty dealing with the racial attitudes of his Southern parents and friends. His fiancée's family harbors doubts about his fitness as a son-in-law, and his parents are downcast because of his disability. Larry is happy to see his fiancée Chris, although he still thinks of Judy. After a bad experience at his homecoming party, he tells Chris of the difficulties that they can expect with his disability and that he wants to relocate rather than be patronized with the menial local job that her successful father has offered him. After some thought, Chris tells Larry that she does not feel strong enough to marry and move far away with him while he struggles to make a new life for both of them. Returning to the hospital, Larry takes a side trip to Philadelphia and meets the successful blind lawyer, who tells him that life is difficult but worth the struggle and that his wife was an invaluable helper to him in his career. At the train station en route to begin a more advanced rehabilitation course, Larry is unexpectedly reunited with Judy, and they joyfully declare their love. Boarding the train, he hears Joe Morgan's name called. He catches Joe's arm, apologizes for all of the hurt he has caused and asks that they remain friends, and Joe accepts the apology. They board and sit together as the train leaves the station.",

They attempt to rob a blind street musician and, failing at first, later track him down, beat him, and destroy his instruments. With the help of Pedro, El Jaibo tracks down Julián, the youngster who supposedly sent him to jail. El Jaibo puts his unharmed arm in a sling, hides a rock in it and confronts Julián, who denies that he reported him to the police and refuses to fight El Jaibo because it would not be a fair fight. As Julián starts to walk away, El Jaibo hits him in the back of the head with the rock. He then beats Julián to death with a stick and takes his money. El Jaibo warns Pedro not to report the crime and shares Julián's money with Pedro to make him an accomplice. thumb|left|Alfonso Mejía as Pedro (right, behind) in a publicity photo for the film Pedro's mother resents her son's behavior, and shows that she doesn't love or care for him. Pedro is saddened by this, vows to start behaving better and finds work as apprentice to a blacksmith. One day, El Jaibo comes to talk with him about their secret and, unbeknownst to Pedro, steals a customer's knife from the blacksmith's table. Pedro is accused of the crime and sent to a juvenile rehabilitation program, the \"farm school\", where he gets into a fight and kills two chickens. The principal tests Pedro by handing Pedro a 50 pesos bill to run errands with. Pedro accepts and leaves with the intention to complete the errands. As soon as he leaves, he encounters El Jaibo, who steals the money. Upset that his attempt to be good was foiled again, Pedro tracks down El Jaibo and fights him. The fight ends in a stalemate, but Pedro announces to the crowd that it was El Jaibo who killed Julián. El Jaibo flees, but the blind man has heard the accusation and tells the police. Pedro tracks El Jaibo down once again to murder him. El Jaibo kills Pedro. While fleeing, El Jaibo encounters the police and, as he tries to run away, the police shoot and kill him. Meche and her grandfather find Pedro's body in their shed. Not wanting to get involved, they dump his body down a garbage-covered cliff.

    "Synopsis": "Lolotta, a kind old woman, discovers a baby in her cabbage patch and adopts the boy, who she names Totò. She teaches him things like math, but also instills him with joy and wonder, and they live together happily until he is 11, when Lolotta dies. Totò is sent to an orphanage, where he stays until reaching adulthood. Cast out alone into the cold Milanese winter, Totò, who has not lost his openhearted optimism, winds up settling in a shantytown on the outskirts of the city. Totò's presence initiates a transformation in the shantytown, and soon it begins to become a real community, with the inhabitants working together to build sturdier and more elaborate structures along named streets surrounding a central square. New arrivals are welcomed, and the community grows. One day, Brambi and Mobbi, two wealthy businessmen, come to look at the plot of land on which the squatters are living, as Mobbi is considering purchasing it from Brambi. Totò invites them to warm their hands at a small fire, and an uncomfortable Mobbi, who does not like Brambi's price for the land anyway, makes a speech saying the squatters should not have to move, and that they are all brothers. The squatters cheer Mobbi as he and Brambi beat a hasty retreat. During a celebration, as a hole is being dug for a maypole, oil is discovered beneath the shantytown, though the residents initially mistake the clear liquid for water. Rappi, a scheming resident who does not get along with his neighbors, alerts Mobbi in exchange for a reward, and Mobbi promptly purchases the land and sends one of his employees to tell the squatters to leave. The residents drive the man away, and Totò brings the leaders of the settlement to talk with Mobbi, as he believes the magnate's earlier speech was sincere. While he delays the leadership of the shantytown in his office, Mobbi sends his personal police force to begin the evictions, and Totò and his comrades return to discover their neighbors defeated. They lead a charge that pushes back the officers, but then Mobbi arrives with more forces, and the residents are driven back against the railroad tracks by smoke bombs. Totò climbs the maypole and waves his handkerchief as a white flag, but, just then, the ghostly spirit of Lolotta comes down from the sky and gives him a magical dove, saying it will allow him to do whatever he wants, before she flies off, chased by two angels. Using the dove, Totò drives away Mobbi and his troops. His neighbors have noticed the miraculous occurrences, however, and they start to ask him for things. Some requests are practical, and many are not, but he does not discriminate, and spends the next several hours granting as many wishes as he can. With difficulty, Totò eventually slips away to talk with Edvige, a young woman with whom he is smitten. She is initially frightened of him, but he denies there is anything magical or holy about him, and she gradually relaxes. All she can think to ask for is a new pair of shoes, but, after they kiss, Totò offers to give Edvige the Sun. As they watch it rise (after having set not long before), the angels take back the dove. Unfortunately, Mobbi's regrouped troops made a plan to attack at sunrise. They storm into the shantytown and quickly overrun the residents and herd them into police wagons. Edvige evades capture and finds a dove, which she hurries to bring to Totò, handing him the bird through the bars just as the squatters are being taken past Milan's central square. It is just an ordinary dove, but Lolotta almost immediately appears and swaps it for the magical one, which she has retrieved from the angels, who then take her and the ordinary dove up to heaven. thumb|A still from the final scene, the escape on broomstick Totò makes the police wagons fall apart and yells for the squatters to grab broomsticks from the workers sweeping the square. They take off, flying over the Milan Cathedral on their way \"towards a land where 'good morning' really means 'good morning'!\"",

    "Synopsis": "Following a scandalous broken engagement, Miss Julie, the daughter of Count Carl, forgoes a family Midsummer's Eve celebration to \"honour\" the estate servants' ball with her presence. There, she dances with one of the servants, Jean, whom she is attracted to. She orders him to sit at the table with her for beers and humiliatingly forces him to kiss her shoe. Outside, she makes advances on him; the hand, hiding behind a sculpture, witnesses the encounter in shock. Miss Julie asks Jean if he has ever been in love. He replies that he loved her as a boy when he lived in poverty and saw her on the estate, but he was chased off as an \"urchin.\" The servants march forward, singing and looking for Jean; Julie and Jean realize the scandal that will erupt if they are seen together and attempt to escape and hide, but the hand has already told of what he saw. Jean and Julie contemplate escape; Jean, condemning the tradition and class bias of Sweden, wishes to take a train to Italy, where he can run a hotel with investment capital from Julie. Julie replies that she has no money of her own and is shocked by his sudden demeanor of callousness towards her. He is unconcerned about her fears of the Count learning of the scandal and reveals he is not willing to die for her, as he suggested. Just as he had told her about his boyhood, Julie recounts her girlhood: Her mother Berta was a commoner who believed in women's rights and had to be persuaded to marry. She married Count Carl, and they had Julie, who was dressed in boy's clothes, but Julie preferred playing with dolls. The Countess set fire to their home. The Count later attempted suicide by firearm. Upon hearing the story, Jean declares himself of superior heritage, as Julie is the daughter of an arsonist. Before leaving on Midsummer's Day, Jean sees Julie's finch Serine and declares they cannot take a birdcage. When Julie says she would rather Serine die than be left behind, Jean breaks its neck; Julie curses him and the day she was born. When the Count returns, he finds Julie has killed herself by razor, under the portrait of the Countess.",

    "Synopsis": "The film tells about the activities of the association of composers \"The Five\", who were drawing inspiration from Russian folk art. Like many representatives of the Russian intelligentsia, members of this musical community were imbued with the plight of the peasants and sought to write works that would draw people's attention to this poorest layer of society. The young composer Modest Mussorgsky decides to devote his life to music and to make it the property of the people. Only his mother supports his “ignoble” undertakings. The young man leaves military service and ponders writing a work about the peasants, together with members of The Five. The Imperial Musical Society is not pleased with the activities of composers; it excludes Mily Balakirev. The writer Vladimir Stasov expresses his opinion by calling the Society newspaper musical liars, eventually ending up in court for libel, and being sued for a monetary penalty. During a trial, many supporters of \"The Five\" are presented. A peasant music school, created by composers, is described for debts. Meanwhile, not one of the editions of Mussorgsky's opera Boris Godunov was allowed to appear in the imperial theaters. The directorate surrenders when the whole city begins to protest; the opera is a tremendous success. Boris Godunov radically changes the direction of the work of Russian composers.",

After reaching Naples by train, Ciccio tries to slip away but is grabbed by Vanni. Vanni tells Barbara where to meet at the border if anything should go wrong. In Rome, Ciccio points out Vanni to the police. In the shoot-out, both Vanni and Ciccio escape. The others are arrested. They are ordered by the police to return to Sicily or be charged with \"illegal expatriation\". With Saro as leader, and nearly out of money, they head north instead.

    "Synopsis": "Andrew Crocker-Harris is an ageing classics master at an English public school, and is forced into retirement by his increasing ill health. The film, in common with the original stage play, follows the schoolmaster's final two days in his post, as he comes to terms with his sense of failure as a teacher, a sense of weakness exacerbated by his wife's infidelity and the realisation that he is despised by both pupils and staff of the school. The emotional turning point for the cold Crocker-Harris is his pupil Taplow's unexpected parting gift, Robert Browning's translation of the Agamemnon, which he has inscribed with the Greek phrase that translates as \"God from afar looks graciously upon a gentle master\". Rattigan extends the screenplay far from his own one-act play, which ends with Crocker-Harris's tearful reaction to Taplow's gift. Therefore, the play ends well before Crocker-Harris's farewell speech to the school; the film shows the speech, in which he discards his notes and admits his failings, to be received with enthusiastic applause and cheers by the boys. The film ends with a conversation between Crocker-Harris and Taplow, and the suggestion that Crocker-Harris will complete his translation of the Agamemnon.",

Unlike the other veterans, his happiness at returning home is clouded by the death of his brother, a partisan shot by the Germans because of the betrayal of a fellow villager. Determined to avenge his brother, he tries to get the name of the informer told, but the villagers, tired of the violence and the blood of the war, refused to reveal it. Mastro Antonio, a modest carpenter friend of Bruno, for fear that an innocent person might be killed, makes him believe that the man he is looking for is him. At that confession Bruno takes a file and throws it at his heart. Before dying, the carpenter admits that he lied and sacrificed himself in place of the culprit. Having found the real culprit, he offers himself to Bruno's machine gun shots, but the latter, mindful of his friend's words, does not have the strength to hit the culprit, since an innocent person has already paid for him.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1923, Tate College freshman Harold Diddlebock is brought into his college's football team where he scores the winning touchdown. The mild-mannered Harold is quickly offered a job by the pompous advertising tycoon J.E. Waggleberry. Although Harold dreams of becoming an \"ideas man\", Waggleberry assigns him to a lowly position in the bookkeeping department. In 1945, the now middle-aged Harold is let go by Waggleberry for old age and not being an ideas-man. He is given an 18 karat Swiss watch and a severance check for $2,946.12, the remains of his company investment plan. He bids farewell to Miss Otis, a young woman who works at an artist's desk down the aisle, giving her the paid-for engagement ring that he had, having planned to marry each of her six older sisters (Hortense, Irma, Harriet, Margie, Claire, and Rosemary) when they had worked there before her. He wanders out, aimlessly through the streets, his life's savings in his trouser pocket. Harold is approached by Wormy, a local con artist, petty gambler, and racetrack tout, who asks Harold for some money so he can place a bet. Seeing the large amount of cash that Harold has, and hoping to get him drunk enough to acquire some of the cash, Wormy takes Harold to a local bar for a drink. When Harold tells the bartender, Jake, that he has never had a drink in his life, the barkeep creates a potent cocktail he calls \"The Diddlebock\". The effects of the alcohol causes Harold to yowl uncontrollably. Gazing at himself in the bar mirror, Harold suddenly declares himself a loser and races out to remake himself. Soon Harold is getting his hair cut and his nails manicured at a local tailor shop and salon, and is trying on a gaudy plaid suit supplied by tailor Formfit Franklin. In the midst of his transformation, Harold overhears Wormy talking with his bookie Max, and impulsively bets $1,000 of his money on a 15-to-one long shot horse named Emmaline. To everyone's surprise, Emmaline wins, and the now-rich Harold celebrates all around town on a day-and-a-half binge of spending, gambling, and carousing. Days later, Harold wakes up on the sofa inside the house of his widowed sister Flora. She chastises him for his behavior. He is hungover, and finds he has a garish new wardrobe and a ten-gallon cowboy hat. Unable to remember much about his drunken binge, Harold goes to return the plaid suit and is surprised to learn that he now owns a horse-drawn cab, complete with an English driver named Thomas. A worried Wormy then rushes up and informs Harold that, with winnings from a second bet, Harold also bought a bankrupt circus. Seeing no future with the ownership of the circus, Harold gets the idea to sell the circus to a Wall Street banker. Harold and Wormy visit the circus-loving Wall Street banker Lynn Sargent, but he turns them down because he is trying to unload his own bankrupt circus. When the rest of the town's bankers follow suit, Harold comes up with an idea. To get past the bank guards, Harold dresses up in his plaid suit and brings along Jackie, a tame circus lion, who incites panic. Carrying a filled Thermos, Wormy gives shot drinks of the potent \"Diddlebock\" cocktail to each of the bankers they visit so their inhibitions will fade and convince them to put in bids for ownership of the circus. Harold, Wormy, and Jackie the Lion are arrested and thrown in jail. Miss Otis bails them out the following day. They find that the publicity has attracted a mob of bankers at the jail who want to buy the circus &ndash; but Ringling Brothers outbids them. Harold celebrates with another \"Diddlebock\", and again has another relapse. Harold wakes up days later in the horse-drawn cab with Miss Otis, where he learns that he received $175,000 for the sale of the circus, he is now an executive at Waggleberry's advertising agency, and that he and Miss Otis are married. Reassuring Harold that she truly loves him, Miss Otis gives him a big kiss.",

From there, she was transferred to an orphanage run by Asim Effendi (Fattouh Nashati) and the director (Negma Ibrahim), who name her Laila Abdullah and entrust her to the wet nurse, Zainab (Aziza Helmy). Dr. Kamal Al-Safty (Mahmoud el-Meliguy), who lives nearby and supervises the nurses at the orphanage, wishes to adopt Laila but demurs to avoid bothering his barren wife (Zouzou Hamdi El Hakim). Zainab continues to care for Laila but catches diphtheria from a recovering orphan named Jamila (Suhair Fakhri); before Zainab dies of it, she asks Laila to call Zainab’s daughter Kawkab, who lives in the affluent Al-Munirah neighborhood of Cairo. Laila (Mariam Fakhr Eddine) grows up to become a nurse and is recruited by Kamal to work in his hospital, earning the jealousy of her colleagues. Laila rents a room in Al-Munirah from Umm Soraya (Ferdoos Mohammed) alongside milk seller Kawkab (Magda al-Sabahi), who knows and keeps the secret of being Laila’s milk sibling. The nurse Samira (Sanaa Samih) is the ringleader of those who discover Laila’s secret and expel her by telling Kamal she was secretly claiming to be his own child. A jurist named Sayid Amir (Hussein Riad), who she operates on, helps her find work outside Cairo, specifically at Al Mouwasat University Hospital in Alexandria, while Kawkab gets married and joins her husband in Faiyum. Laila finds friendship and soon something more with Dr. Rushdi Abdellatif (Gamal Fares), bringing out jealousy once again from nurse Souad (Samiha Tawfik. On Amir’s advice, she comes clean about her origins to Rushdi, who accepts her and takes her to meet his father Abdellatif (Abbas Faris) and mother (Zainab Sidqi) in Faiyum. Rushdi tells his parents that Laila is the daughter of a wealthy man, but Kawkab innocently reveals otherwise, causing Abdellatif to reject Laila. Laila accepts this, not wanting to come between father and son, but Amir steps in and proclaims that if he can accept her as his daughter, Abdellatif can accept her as daughter-in-law, paving the way for the happy ending.",

He pretends they know each other and asks her to dance, unaware it is Lise, the girl Henri loves. Lise, uninterested in Jerry, rebuffs him, but Jerry persists. Milo is upset that Jerry flirted with another girl in her presence and abruptly leaves. In the car, she tearfully criticizes Jerry for being rude and inconsiderate. The next day, Jerry calls Lise, but she tells him to leave her alone. Meanwhile, Milo has arranged a showing with a collector interested in Jerry's work. Before the meeting, Jerry goes to the parfumerie where Lise works, and his persistence finally wins her over. She agrees to meet him that evening but wants to avoid public places; they share a romantic song and dance along the banks of the Seine River (\"Love Is Here to Stay\"). Lise then rushes off to meet Henri after his performance (\"I'll Build a Stairway to Paradise\"). Henri tells Lise he is going on tour in America and proposes marriage to her. Later Adam humorously daydreams he is performing Gershwin's Concerto in F for Piano and Orchestra in a concert hall. As the scene progresses, Adam is also the conductor, other musicians, and even an audience member enthusiastically applauding at the end. Milo rents Jerry a lavish art studio and tells him she is planning an exhibition of his work in three months' time. Jerry initially refuses the studio but accepts on condition he will repay Milo when his work sells. After a month of courting, Jerry brings Lise to his apartment building. When Lise suddenly rushes off in a waiting taxi, Jerry is confused and complains to Adam, who realizes that Henri and Jerry are in love with the same girl. Henri and Jerry later discuss the girl they each love ( 'S&nbsp;Wonderful\") without realizing it is Lise. That night, Jerry and Lise meet by the Seine. Lise informs him that she and Henri are to be married and will be going to America. Though Lise feels duty-bound to Henri for protecting her during the war, Jerry and Lise proclaim their love for each other before parting. Dejected, Jerry invites Milo to the art students' masked ball, where they run into Henri and Lise. Jerry admits to Milo that he loves Lise. When Henri overhears Jerry and Lise saying goodbye, he realizes the truth. As Henri and Lise drive away, Jerry fantasizes through a diverse and extended dance scene with Lise all over Paris and set to George Gershwin's An American in Paris. A car horn breaks Jerry's reverie; Henri releases Lise from their relationship to return to Jerry, where they embrace on the staircase and leave together to Gershwin's music as the film ends.",

    "Synopsis": "Detective Jim McLeod, whose violent criminal father drove his mother to insanity, nurtures a lifelong hatred of lawbreakers and is convinced that he has a flawless instinct for identifying criminals. He maintains a particular contempt for Dr. Karl Schneider, whom McLeod is convinced has performed illegal abortions that have resulted in the deaths of both women and their babies. McLeod has persuaded Schneider's assistant to implicate him in a police lineup. However, Schneider bribes her not to identify him, infuriating McLeod. Several other cases are being processed in the bullpen. The detectives have arrested burglar Charley Gennini, who is revealed to be a psychopath with an extensive criminal record, including murder and rape. McLeod also books a young man named Arthur Kindred who has admitted to stealing money from his employer to try to impress the girl whom he loves. Although the employer is sympathetic and wants to drop charges after he is repaid, McLeod refuses to release the remorseful Kindred, saying that leniency only leads to more crime. Despite evidence of Kindred's kind nature, McLeod is unwilling to distinguish between a first-time offender like Kindred and a dangerous repeat offender like Gennini. McLeod misses another chance to establish Schneider's guilt when a victim dies in the hospital. Schneider boasts that he has sensitive knowledge about McLeod, who finally explodes in anger and brutally attacks him, requiring McLeod's commanding officer Lt. Monoghan to escort Schneider to the hospital in an ambulance. Schneider, half-conscious, mentions the name Giacoppetti in connection with a woman supposedly linked with McLeod. When Schneider's lawyer Endicott Sims arrives to protest the incident, he inadvertently discloses that the woman to whom Schneider was referring is McLeod's wife Mary. Monaghan has Mary brought to the station and interviews her in private. She denies any connections until Monaghan invites Giacoppetti to enter and he greets her by name. Mary admits to her husband that years ago she had become pregnant by Giacoppetti. McLeod, who had been worried about her apparent infertility, is disgusted by the thought that it was caused by her abortion by Schneider, especially when Sims hints that there may have been more lovers. After McLeod accuses her of infidelity, Mary tells him that he is cruel like his father was and leaves him. Gennini suddenly takes advantage of a distraction to steal an officer's revolver, and he fatally shoots McLeod before being disarmed. Dying, McLeod instructs his partner to release Kindred and to tell his wife that he begs her forgiveness. The local paper praises McLeod for dying in the line of duty.",

    "Synopsis": "Idle Tom Ramsay continually borrows from his hard-working brother George. George later puts up the Ramsay estate for sale so he can buy out his business partner, despite Tom's protests. Shortly afterwards, George is approached by car dealer Philip Cronshaw, who notifies him that Tom has stolen one of his automobiles. To avoid a scandal, George pays for it, but it was all a fraud; Cronshaw and Tom split George's money. While squandering his ill-gotten funds, Tom discovers that Gertrude Wilmot, the third richest woman in the world, is staying at the same seaside resort. He becomes acquainted with her, then (surmising that she is fed up with lying admirers) frankly admits that he is a scoundrel attracted to her great wealth. Surprisingly, this approach works and they become engaged. Tom pays George back for all the money he borrowed over the years. When George complains about the injustice of Tom not having to work for his good fortune, Tom mentions that Gertrude is buying the family estate. English spinster Molly Reid takes a sea cruise to Jamaica. To the annoyance of the other passengers and the crew, she talks non-stop on the outbound voyage. When the captain (Noel Purcell) learns that she will be returning on the same ship, he decides that something must be done to save the sanity of the crew. The ship's doctor suggests setting her up with a suitor. Pierre, the steward, is ordered to keep Molly occupied. The plan works; the crew's ears are spared, though Molly tells Pierre that she knows he is not in love with her. When disembarking from the ship, Molly tells the captain and crew that she knew all along that the romance had been arranged. In Monte Carlo, Stella and Syd Cotman have a very successful nightclub act. She dives from a great height into a small, shallow tank of flaming water. However, a visit by Flora and Carlo Penezzi unnerves her. The older Penezzis used to have a similarly dangerous act: Flora was shot out of a cannon. Stella and Syd argue when she refuses to dive a second time each night, forcing Syd to change their contract with the nightclub manager. In desperation, Stella takes their life savings, and attempts to win enough at the gambling tables so she can quit, but loses everything. Syd is infuriated when he finds out. With no choice, she goes on with the act, even though she is terrified that she will eventually be killed. When Flora tells Syd how frightened his wife is, he rushes up the tower to stop her. But she, seeing his concern, dives safely into the tank.",

    "Synopsis": "The plot begins when the Pérez family of country bumpkins arrive from the countryside at the Madrid train station, disoriented, gawking and loaded down with baggage, including a basket of live chickens. The Pérez family consists of a mother (who is never named in the movie), the fiftyish aged father, Manuel, his older son Pepe (who had visited Madrid during the Spanish Civil War), his younger son, Manolo and his slightly impish, but completely naïve daughter, Tonia. They move in with a relative of the mother in a run down apartment complex that is overrun with hordes of children who do cruel things every time they get a chance, showing that none of them are attending school at that point in Franco's Spain. In the apartment they meet the relative's daughter, the street smart Pili. Pili makes a living for her mother and herself by selling contraband American cigarettes in the street. Pili has an evil boyfriend, El Mellao. El Mellao works for the even more evil black marketer, but well dressed, very rich and smooth, Don Roque (\"El Chamberlain\"). Pepe quickly makes an implacable enemy of El Mellao when he defends Pili from his abuses and Don Roque hires Pepe in the place of El Mellao to drive around his contraband, because Pepe will do it for less. Pepe and Pili also become a couple and move in together. The father, Manuel tries selling candy in the street for his sister in law, but fails when the multitude of street children demand that he give it to them for free. Then a police officer takes away his entire supply because he is selling without a license. His sister in law is so enraged that she makes a very proud Manuel do kitchen work. Then, to Manuel's surprise, a note arrives that he has gotten a job in a foundry. However, when he attempts to work in the arduous conditions, he is quickly overcome by the noise and heat of the foundry and faints, losing the job almost immediately. His sister in law then again relegates him to humiliating kitchen work. Pepe's job for Don Roque is to work with a gang that steals sacks of potatoes from trucks that are climbing a hill and then deliver those potatoes to Don Roque to sell on the black market. Tonia also meets Don Roque through Pepe and Pili, who immediately has designs on her. First, he hires Tonia as a maid for his mistress. Tonia is very impressed by all the fine clothing that Don Roque's mistress has. When Don Roque hears Tonia sing while working, he tells her she has talent and offers to pay for singing lessons for her. With her mother's reluctant consent, Tonia accepts enthusiastically. He buys her a lot of attractive clothing, supposedly so she will be well dressed for her performance as a singer. However, when she actually gets the chance to sing on stage, some ruffians, hired by Don Roque, disrupt her performance and make her look foolish. Tonia runs off the stage in tears. Then, Don Roque comforts Tonia and takes her away in his limousine to deflower her and make her his mistress. Manuel is totally shocked by the whole thing and slaps his wife around for letting it happen. Then, Manuel shows up unexpectedly at the door of the love nest, slaps a shocked Tonia hard and cries bitterly while she goes to get her things so he can take her away. Pepe loses his job with Don Roque when he confronts him about deflowering his sister and demands that Don Roque marry her, which Don Roque laughs off with contempt. Pili still demands that he steal from trucks, but the rest of Don Roque's gang refuses to accompany him and El Mellao tips off the authorities that Pepe is about to try it without them. When Pepe hops into the back of the truck, they are waiting for him. They shoot him and he is further injured when he jumps off the truck. When he returns in the truck, badly injured, he finds El Mellao trying to drag away Pili as his prize. El Mellao then hits Pepe on the head with a large wrench and rushes off to chase a fleeing Pili. Don Roque arrives to find Pepe badly injured, but still alive. He takes him to a bridge and throws him onto railroad tracks as a train passes under the bridge. In the last scene of the movie, Manuel, his wife, Manolo and Tonia have returned to their village where Pepe is being buried. Manuel picks up a handful of soil from the grave and tells his family that they have to return to the country. His wife says people will laugh, but Manuel replies that, even with shame, they have to return to the land.",

When Oliverio's mother is dying, she wants to quickly write a will so that the youngest son gets his share and the two older brothers don't collect everything. Because his mother is too weak to travel, Oliverio is supposed to bring a notary from the city to her. So he takes the bus, but unforeseen events constantly interrupt the journey. These interruptions affect all aspects of life; a birth as well as a funeral, and a breakdown when the bus hits a river. The most pleasant companion for Oliverio on this journey is the seductive Raquel. In the end, Oliverio returns to his mother, who has died in the meantime, without the notary, but he can still secure his share of the inheritance by means of a fingerprint under the will she wants.",

    "film_title": "Othello (1951 film)",
    "Synopsis": "The film closely follows the plot of the play, but restructures and reorders individual scenes. Welles trimmed the source material, which is generally around three hours when performed, to a little over 90 minutes for the film. The opening funeral scene is not in the original play. The movie opens with Othello and Desdemona's funeral. The first main scene shows Iago's complaining to Roderigo about not being advised of the marriage between Othello and Desdemona. Roderigo is contemplating killing himself but Iago says “Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen, I would change my humanity with a baboon,” meaning Iago would rather be a baboon than kill himself over a woman. Iago further says \"Put but money in thy purse\" and urges Roderigo to sell all his lands and give the money to Iago, who will use it to convince Desdemona to have sex. Desdemona's father Brabantio is furious about the marriage after being told of it by Iago and Roderigo. Brabantio accuses Othello of bewitching his daughter. Othello convinces Brabantio that it was not witchcraft but rather by his tragic tales. By planting a handkerchief, Iago convinces Othello that Desdemona is having an affair with Cassio. Othello previously promoted Cassio to lieutenant over Iago, hence Iago's jealousy. Othello strangles Desdemona. Iago knifes Emilia to death as she protests Desdemona's innocence. Othello realises his mistake.",

The story is located in Spain during the barbarian invasions. The warrior Roderico, tired of fighting, stops Klingsor from abusing a captive woman. Klingsor challenges him as a coward before the barbarian king who holds the holy lance. In the fight, Roderico wins but refuses to kill Klingsor, who treacherously wounds him. Roderico leaves with the captive. The king disapproves of treachery. Klingsor challenges him and becomes the king of the barbarians. He devotes himself to magic. After Roderico's death, the captive bears a boy, Parsifal. She tries to find the grail but cannot. They refuge in Montserrat. A troop of grail knights passes and encourages the young child. When looking for Parsifal, his mother falls to her death. Parsifal is bred by wolves in the mountain. As a young man armed with his father's bow, Parsifal meets the knights again. He also meets Kundria, Klingsor's daughter, the first woman he meets after his mother. He watches Kundria seduce Amfortas, who is wounded by Klingsor. Klingsor sends his virgin daughter to seduce Parsifal, but he refuses. She repents and leaves. Parsifal clashes with Klingsor's tribe. A barbarian dwarf changes sides and brings the knights. Parsifal and Klingsor fight a single combat. Like his father, Parsifal wins and Klingsor tries to kill treacherously. The dwarf kills him with Roderico's bow. Parsifal quests helping the weak against the oppressors. He confronts the seven capital sins in the guise of young women. He resists temptation and proceeds in his quest. Having smelled the flower of pride, his good deeds are however tainted. Years pass. Parsifal's feats are no longer out of pride. Amfortas suffers of his wound and the grail is kept in a case. On Good Friday, Gurnemancio meets an armed knight. He reproaches him, and the knight disarms, revealing Parsifal with Christ-like beard and mane. Parsifal kneels before the lance and his sword, that are laid in a cross shape. Kundria has led a life of repentance and washes Parsifal's feet with her hair, like Mary of Bethany did to Jesus. He baptises her. Entering the grail cave, he touches Amfortas with the lance. A dove returns to fly over the grail. In the frame story, the soldiers close the book and watch an old priest leaving a chalice on the altar of a ruined church while supernatural light shines on it.",

    "Synopsis": "thumb|left|upright|260px|Giulio Stival as the mayor and [[Renato Rascel as Carmine]] The Northern Italian town of Pavia in the 1930s. Carmine De Carmine, a clerk employed in the town hall, lives very modestly in a rented room. He is devoted to his work, but is continually ignored or demeaned by the town's general secretary as well as by the mayor, an ambitious and corrupt politician, who has both a wife and a mistress. Carmine wears a shabby and threadbare coat which leaves him exposed to cold winter winds, but since he can barely pay the rent, a good winter coat is beyond his means. One day a beautiful and elegant woman, taking him for a beggar, gives him a considerable sum which Carmine brings to a tailor as a downpayment for an elegant coat with a fur collar. thumb|left|upright|260px|Giulio Calì as the tailor with [[Renato Rascel]] At work, Carmine is accidentally present at a compromising meeting during which businessmen promise a bribe to the general secretary who, to keep Carmine quiet, promises him a large productivity bonus. Meanwhile, the coat is finally ready and, as Carmine puts it on, he feels like a king and walks around the town as if he owns the place, followed by the tailor who is proud of his own role in Carmine's transformation. On New Year's Eve wearing, as usual, his precious overcoat, he goes to the reception to which he had been invited by the secretary general. There, he sees the same beautiful lady who had given him the money and who, unknown to him, is the mayor's mistress. Tipsy from the numerous New Year's toasts, Carmine makes a speech expressing compassion for the impoverished masses, which is very coldly received by the other attendees. Finally, before leaving, he waltzes with the beautiful woman. After the party, as Carmine is walking home down a dark street, filled with the aspiration of finally being somebody, he is attacked and robbed of the coat. Desolate, he asks for help and sympathy from anyone who would listen, but they are all indifferent, including policemen, municipal officials and, above all, the mayor, who brusquely tells Carmine not to bother him with such trivialities. In a hopeless mindset, Carmine returns to wearing his tattered old coat, but soon suffers a nervous breakdown followed by pneumonia which ends his life. thumb|left|upright|260px|Yvonne Sanson as the mayor's mistress and [[Giulio Stival as the mayor]] However, even after death, Carmine's hurt and humiliated spirit cannot rest. After the noisy passage of his funeral wagon disturbs a pompous public ceremony officiated by the mayor, Carmine's apparition roams the town streets, stripping pedestrians of their winter coats during cold and foggy winter evenings and frightening them with sound of his voice. He appears in the house of the mayor's beautiful mistress, while the mayor is there, violating their privacy and causing the mayor to experience a premonition of unease which comes to a realization when, on his way home through a dark street, he is confronted with the visible image of Carmine, floating a slight distance above the ground. Shocked, the mayor listens as Carmine recounts to him, from the beyond, the weight carried by the lack of empathy and humanity from him and others like him. As Carmine speaks, the mayor's dark hair turns white and he repents.",

    "Synopsis": "Police disperse an organized street demonstration of elderly men demanding a raise in their meager pensions. One of the marchers is Umberto D. Ferrari, a retired government worker. He returns to his room and finds that his landlady has rented it out for an hour to a young couple to have sex. She threatens to evict Ferrari at the end of the month if he cannot pay the overdue rent, fifteen thousand lire. He sells a watch and some books, but only raises a third of the amount. The landlady refuses to accept partial payment. Meanwhile, the sympathetic maid confides in Umberto that she has her own problems. She is three months pregnant, but is unsure which of her two lovers (both soldiers) is the father, the tall one from Naples or the short one from Florence. Feeling ill, Umberto gets himself admitted to a hospital. It turns out to be tonsillitis and he is discharged after a few days. When he returns to the apartment, he finds workmen renovating the entire place. The landlady is getting married. Umberto's room has a gaping hole in the wall. The maid tells him it is to become part of an enlarged living room. The maid was taking care of his dog Flike, but a door was left open and Flike ran away. Umberto rushes to the city pound and is relieved to find his dog; however, when he makes a veiled plea for a loan to one of his friends who has a job, the friend refuses to listen. Unable to bring himself to beg from strangers on the street Umberto contemplates suicide, but knows he must first see that Flike is taken care of. He packs his belongings and leaves the apartment. His parting advice to the maid is to get rid of the boyfriend from Florence. Umberto attempts to find a place for Flike, first with a couple who board dogs, then a little girl he knows, but the latter's nanny makes her give the dog back. Flike goes to play with some children and Umberto slips away, hoping that one of them will adopt him. Despite Umberto's attempt to abandon Flike, the dog finds him hiding under a footbridge. Finally in desperation, Umberto takes the dog in his arms and walks on to a railway track as a speeding train approaches. Flike becomes frightened, wriggles free and flees. Umberto runs after him. At first, Flike seems to be frightened and hides from Umberto, but Flike seems to be coaxing Umberto away from the tracks and back into the park. The chase slowly morphs into play as Umberto lures Flike with a pine cone. The movie ends with Umberto and Flike running and playing down the park lane.",

    "Synopsis": "Emiliano Zapata is part of a delegation sent to complain about injustices to corrupt longtime president Porfirio Díaz, but Díaz dismisses their concerns, driving Zapata to open rebellion, along with his brother Eufemio. He unites with Pancho Villa under the leadership of naive reformer Francisco Madero. Díaz is finally toppled and Madero takes his place, but Zapata is dismayed to find that nothing is changing. Madero offers Zapata land of his own while failing to take action to distribute land to the campesinos who fought to end the dictatorship and break up the estates of the elites. Zapata rejects the offer and seeks no personal gain. Meanwhile, the ineffectual but well-meaning Madero puts his trust in treacherous general Victoriano Huerta. Huerta first takes Madero captive and then has him murdered. As it becomes clear that each new regime is no less corrupt and self-serving than the one it replaced, Zapata remains guided by his desire to return to the peasants their recently robbed lands while forsaking his personal interests. His brother sets himself up as a petty dictator, taking what he wants without regard for the law, but Zapata remains a rebel leader of high integrity. Although he is able to defeat Huerta after Madero's assassination, as a result of his integrity, Zapata loses his brother and his position. Although in the end Zapata himself is lured into an ambush and killed, the film suggests that the resistance of the campesinos does not end. Rumors begin that Zapata never died, but is instead continuing to fight from the hills, feeding the campesinos a sense of hope. As several scenes suggest, over the years, the campesinos have learned to lead themselves rather than looking to others to lead them.",

    "Synopsis": "In three episodes, the film portrays the fate of women during the Meiji era: Episode 1: \"The Thirteenth Night\": Young wife Seki turns up at her parents' house, announcing that she wants to divorce her abusive husband. Her father talks her into returning to her marital home, as her parents' welfare and the career of her brother depend on the marriage, also reminding her that she will have to leave her young son behind. On her way back home in a rickshaw, she discovers that the driver is Rokunosuke, a childhood friend who never got over their separation. They reminisce their once mutual affection, but part ways without an outlook to meeting again. Episode 2: \"On The Last Day Of The Year\": Mine works as a maid in the strict household of Mrs. Yamamura, wife of a wealthy businessman. To help her sick uncle who is in debt, Mine asks her employer to lend her money. Mrs. Yamamura first agrees, but later withdraws her offer. Out of desperation, Mine steals money from a household drawer and gives it to her aunt. Moments before her misdemeanour is revealed, Mrs. Yamamura's carefree son Ishinosuke takes the remaining money to waste it on gambling and drinking, thus obliterating all traces of Mine's theft. Episode 3: \"Troubled Waters\": Courtesan O-Riki is the \"star\" of a brothel in a red light district. To her disapproval, she is still being followed by her impoverished former patron Genshichi who spent all his money on her. O-Riki gets involved with a new client, Asanosuke, but is reluctant to the possible prospect of marriage, citing her profession and her poor upbringing as reasons. Meanwhile, Genshichi forces his wife and little son to leave him due to her constant complaints that he is unable to support the family. Afterwards, he waylays O-Riki, murders her and commits suicide.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1941, Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt, a bugler and career soldier who was once a professional boxer, transfers from Fort Shafter to a rifle company at Schofield Barracks on the island of Oahu. Captain Dana \"Dynamite\" Holmes wants him on his regimental boxing team, but Prewitt refuses absolutely, with no further explanation. Consequently, Holmes makes Prewitt's life miserable and ultimately orders First Sergeant Milton Warden to prepare a court-martial. Warden suggests doubling Prewitt's company punishment as an alternative. Prewitt is hazed by the other NCOs and is supported only by his close friend, Private Angelo Maggio. Prewitt and Maggio join a social club where Prewitt becomes attracted to Lorene. Prewitt confides to her he quit boxing after blinding his sparring partner. At the club, Maggio argues with stockade Sergeant \"Fatso\" Judson. Later, at a local bar, Judson provokes Maggio and the two nearly come to blows before Warden intervenes. Despite being warned, Warden risks prison when he starts fraternizing with Holmes's wife, Karen. Her marriage to Holmes is unhappy and distant, made worse after Holmes's drinking and infidelity resulted in the stillbirth of her only child and consequent infertility. Karen encourages Warden to become an officer, which would enable her to divorce Holmes and marry him. Maggio is sentenced to the stockade after walking off guard duty and getting drunk, subjecting him to Judson's unqualified (and unauthorized) wrath. Prewitt discovers Lorene's name is really Alma, and her goal is to make enough money at the club to go back to the mainland and marry. Prewitt tells her his career is in the military, and the two wonder whether they have a future together. A member of Holmes's boxing team, Sergeant Galovitch, picks a fight with Prewitt. Holmes fails to stop it, which is noticed by the regimental commander. When Prewitt prevails in the fight, Holmes finally intervenes and is about to punish Prewitt again; but, does nothing after learning Galovitch started the fight. Maggio escapes from the stockade after a brutal beating from Judson and dies in Prewitt's arms. Seeking revenge, Prewitt engages Judson in a back alley knife fight. Prewitt kills Judson but is badly wounded and stays with Lorene. Warden covers for Prewitt's absence. After initiating a review into Holmes's conduct, the regimental commander orders his resignation in lieu of a court martial. Holmes's replacement, Captain Ross, reprimands the other NCOs, demotes Galovitch to private, and affirms there will be no more promotions through boxing. Karen tells Warden that Holmes's resignation is forcing them back to the mainland, but Warden reveals he has no interest in becoming an officer, effectively ending their relationship. Warden promises her that they will meet somewhere someday. On December 7, the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor. Warden takes command, orders coffee be made and leads a fierce resistance to the attack. Despite Lorene's pleas to stay with her, Prewitt attempts to rejoin his company but is shot dead by military police when he refuses to halt. Warden identifies him as a hardhead but a good soldier. Days later, Karen and Lorene coincidentally stand next to each other on a ship going to the mainland. Karen tosses her leis into the sea, wondering if she will ever return to Hawaii. Lorene tells Karen she herself will not return, as her \"fiancé\", whom she identifies as Prewitt, was a bomber pilot who died during the attack and was awarded a Silver Star. Karen recognizes the name but says nothing.",

    "Synopsis": "During the Heiji Rebellion, samurai Endō Morito is assigned to escort lady-in-waiting Kesa away from the palace after she had volunteered to disguise herself as the daimyō’s sister, giving the daimyō’s father and real sister time to escape unseen. Kesa is knocked unconscious when the rebels attack their caravan, and Morito takes her to his brother’s home. When Morito’s brother arrives, he reveals that he too is part of the rebellion and suggests Morito join him. Morito refuses to betray the daimyō, Lord Kiyomori. Once he and Kesa are safe, Morito proves his loyalty to Kiyomori by personally riding to him to deliver news about the insurrection, including his brother's disloyalty. After the coup has failed, Morito encounters Kesa again. Infatuated with her, he asks Lord Kiyomori, who is granting one wish to each of the loyal warriors who helped put down the rebellion, to grant him Kesa’s hand in marriage. He is informed that Kesa is already married to Wataru, a samurai of the Imperial Guard, but Morito demands that his wish be granted. Kesa is concerned by Morito's determination, but Wataru promises to protect her. After hearing Kesa perform koto music, Lord Kiyomori begins to sympathize with Morito. He decides to give Morito a chance to compete for Kesa’s hand. Morito enters a horse race in which Wataru is competing, and outrides him. However, after the race is over, he nearly attacks Wataru at a “Forget the Race” dinner, visibly disturbing everyone around him. Morito goes to speak to Kesa. At Kesa's request, her handmaid Tone tells Morito that Kesa has gone to visit her aunt. Morito goes to the aunt's home and discovers the lie. He forces the aunt to write a note to Kesa claiming she is ill and needs Kesa to come and see her. Kesa is terrified to find Morito waiting for her. When Morito threatens to kill Wataru and Kesa and her aunt if he cannot have his way, Kesa tells him she will fulfill his heart’s desires. She agrees to a plan for Morito to kill Wataru and claim her once she is widowed. Kesa returns home and behaves generously to Tone and lovingly to Wataru. After everyone has gone to bed, Morito sneaks into the bedroom and kills the figure beneath the blankets with his sword. He is horrified to discover that he has killed Kesa. Realizing that Kesa has sacrificed herself rather than subject herself or anyone else to his insanity, Morito fruitlessly begs Wataru to kill him in penance. As Wataru mourns his dead wife, Morito kneels in the courtyard, cuts off his samurai topknot and vows to live thereafter as a monk.",

His wife, Catherine, tired of his infidelities, leaves for Edinburgh to prepare for a divorce. Meanwhile, André, between several opportunistic affairs, falls in love with Patricia, a friend of his wife, and uses numerous timeworn stratagems to seduce her. After tricking her into having dinner at his house, he tells her about his life and his schemes to gain the compassion and protection of one woman after another, deceiving them and growing tired of them as soon as he has seduced them.

Unable to get his way with Patricia, who has been warned by Catherine and who understands that she is just another woman on his list, he goes so far as to fake a suicide by throwing himself out of a window, but he accidentally falls and is left paralysed for life. When Catherine hears that he has tried to commit suicide because of her, she gives up on divorce, although she does not know it was a deception to seduce Patricia: Ripois becomes, in spite of himself, his wife's \"prisoner\", condemned to a life of marital fidelity.",

    "Synopsis": "With Britain in anarchy, warring overlords Arthur Pendragon and his half-sister Morgan LeFay meet as arranged by the sorcerer Merlin to discuss how to end the bloodshed. Merlin leads them to Excalibur, a sword embedded in an anvil and stone and says that according to legend, whoever can remove the sword shall be King of England. Morgan's lover Modred attempts to draw the sword from the anvil and stone and fails, while Arthur removes the sword easily. French knight Sir Lancelot, on his way to join Arthur, encounters the siblings Percival and Elaine, and then Arthur, to whom he pledges himself after an epic duel. Modred assembles Arthur's enemies to challenge his legitimacy to the throne of England. Arthur goes to war against Modred and wins, earning him the crown. He forms a select group of knights, and England enjoys a period of peace and prosperity. During this time, Lancelot rescues Arthur's fiancée Guinevere from being kidnapped by a mysterious knight. Morgan and Modred, who continue to harbor ill feelings against Arthur, note with interest the growing warmth between Lancelot and Guinevere. To distance himself from Guinevere, Lancelot marries Elaine and rides north to defend England's border with Scotland, while Percival, now a knight of the Round Table, goes in search of the Holy Grail. Modred urges Arthur's enemies in Scotland to make peace so that Lancelot will be exposed as Guinevere's lover, and Morgan assassinates Merlin, who is aware of the affair, to prevent him from vetoeing Lancelot's recall. After Elaine's death in childbirth and Arthur's summons, Lancelot returns to Camelot. Late one night, feeling jealous after seeing Lancelot kiss Vivien, Guinevere goes to his quarters. Modred's men soon arrive to arrest them for high treason, but Lancelot and Guinevere manage to escape. They are tried in absentia and declared guilty. Lancelot later returns to surrender, and when he professes his chaste love for Guinevere, Arthur revokes their death sentence. Infuriated, Modred turns the other knights against Arthur, leading to a return of civil war. A truce is briefly agreed upon but collapses almost immediately when a knight draws his sword to kill a snake, sparking the Battle of Camlann. Mortally wounded in the battle, Arthur asks Lancelot to destroy Modred and give Guinevere his love and forgiveness. Also at Arthur's bidding, Lancelot casts Excalibur into the sea from the cliff where Arthur first drew it from the stone. He goes to the nunnery at Amesbury and delivers Arthur's message, then rides on to Modred's castle and challenges him to mortal combat. Lancelot kills Modred and leaves his body in the hands of the grieving Morgan LeFay. Lancelot and Percival return to Camelot and the empty chamber where the Knights of the Round Table had met. There, they are vouchsafed a vision of the Holy Grail, and the voice of God grants them forgiveness and a benediction for their actions.",

Wainwright was then assigned to cover the Battle of Dunkirk and after the evacuation of Allied troops and the French surrender he could not return to Paris. He later learned that his wife was murdered by the Nazis for participating in the French Resistance and that his small son went missing during a bombing raid. This background information is presented via a flashback narrated by Wainwright. The war is now over and the grieving widower has returned to Paris to find his lost little boy. His best friend is Pierre Verdier (played by Dauphin). Wainwright has been told that his son is living in an orphanage. There, he finds a sad and confused boy, Jean (played by Fourcade), who does bear a resemblance to Lisa, and Wainwright believes he might be his son. The Mother Superior (played by Dorziat) insists that the boy is his, but Wainwright is skeptical and sets out to test him. He begins to form an emotional attachment to the boy, but eventually, when the boy fails the test, Wainwright realizes that the child has been fed information in order to help him pass the test. He confronts the nun, who confesses to having tried to help the boy because of her determination to have her orphans placed in good homes and have happy lives. Though Wainwright and the boy have formed a bond, he cannot get over his grief until he speaks to a friend who advises him to face up to his wife's death. While out and about, he has seen a stuffed toy identical to one that Wainwright had won at a carnival for Lisa, and which was named \"Binky\". He buys the toy and has it sent to the orphanage. The movie ends as Wainwright returns to the orphanage, having realized that he needs the boy, even if he may not be the son he lost. Jean, seeing the stuffed dog, hugs it and calls it \"Binky\", thus revealing that he is Wainwright's son.",

    "Synopsis": "Every year, on Good Friday, a procession takes place in a small provincial village. This year the women of the village are unable to choose a girl who can play the Madonna. A local squire, with the intention of publicly mocking the curate Don Vincenzo, ensures that a young prostitute, Maddalena, receives this assignment. Magdalene accepts because she wants to take revenge with the Virgin for the loss of her daughter, who died in boarding school during her first communion, due to a trivial fire of the veil. The women of the village do not accept that a foreigner interprets the Madonna, but the curate defends her choice, even though he does not know who Magdalene really is. During a rehearsal of the procession, Magdalene faints and is invited by the priest to rest. But, passing by the church, he meets a woman in prayer who sees her and, believing that Magdalene is an apparition of the Madonna, invokes her to have her son healed from a serious illness. Magdalene tries to escape, but she is credited with healing the boy and she stays for the Good Friday procession. The squire, however, takes revenge by telling everyone who the girl really is. Faced with this confession, people attack Maddalena and start stoning her.",

    "Synopsis": "The story takes place in the Ukrainian village of Lebedivka. Marina Vlasenko, a hardworking peasant woman, eagerly awaits the return of her husband, Terentiy Vlasenko, who left five years earlier to study agronomy at the Kyiv Agricultural Institute on the kolkhoz's recommendation. However, after his return, Marina's happiness is short-lived. On the very first evening, Terentiy asks for a divorce, claiming that she is no longer his equal, that he has spiritually and intellectually outgrown her, and that he cannot bury his talent in the earth. He wants to move to the city to pursue science and write a dissertation. Marina is left alone, raising their daughter while dedicating herself to work and study. For an entire year, she conducts laboratory experiments to increase the sugar content of beets. The kolkhoz management appoints her as the leader of a new team within the collective farm, allowing her to move her experiments from the laboratory to the field. Marina’s team achieves success, harvesting a rich crop of beets (905 centners per hectare) with increased sugar content. As a result of her significant achievements in agriculture, Marina Panasivna is awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor. It is believed that the character of Marina was based on Marina Stepanovna Suvorova, the leader of the Zemetchinsky beet farm. Like Marina, Suvorova worked on growing sugar beets and was awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor in 1948.",

In Egypt in 1951, Ahmed is congratulated by the peasant farmers after improving and increasing the production of sugar cane on the peasant farm. Taher Pasha, a wealthy land owner who runs a competing sugar cane production facility, feels threatened by the villager's newfound prosperity. Along with his nephew, Riad, the Pasha floods the peasant's sugar cane crops in order to protect his own wealth. After the peasant crops are destroyed, the village Sheikh is the only person to suspect that the Pasha is responsible. Ahmed is in a love relationship with the Pasha's daughter, Amal (Faten Hamama), but due to their different social class, they hide their relationship. Riad asks the Pasha for his permission to marry Amal, but the Pasha refuses. The Pasha soon learns of a heated dispute that occurred between Ahmed's father and the Sheikh. The Pasha uses this to his benefit, as he and Riad steal Saber Effendi's rifle and set up a conspiracy against Saber Effendi. The next day, the Sheikh is found murdered. Saber Effendi is immediately blamed by the angry villagers for his death and is found guilty by the court after testimony by Hassan, the only witness to Saber's innocence. Unbeknownst to the community, Hassan secretly conspired with the Pasha to kill the Sheikh. Hassan turns against Saber, and he is sentenced to death. While Ahmed searches for Hassan to clear his father's name, Selim, the Shiekh's son, prepares to kill Ahmed to further avenge the Sheikh's death. After a short pursuit by Ahmed, Hassan is struck by a train and killed. Saber is executed, and Ahmed, fearing his death, hides in an ancient temple in the desert with the help of Amal. Here, Amal reveals to Ahmed the truth about the Sheikh's murder. Riad attempts to kill Ahmed in the temple, where Ahmed is simultaneously being pursued by Selim. Both Ahmed and Amal are wounded in the chase. Riad kills the Pasha, who confesses his crimes. Selim apologizes to Ahmed, and they both turn Riad over to the police. Ahmed and Amal embrace and walk off into the distance.",

    "Synopsis": "In the early 1900s, two young orphaned brothers, eight-year-old Harry and five-year-old Davy Mackenzie are sent to live at a Scottish settlement in Nova Scotia, Canada with their stern grandfather and grandmother after their father's death in the Boer War. The boys would love to have a dog but are not allowed, Grandaddy holding that \"ye canna eat a dog\". Then they find an abandoned baby. Living in fear of Grandaddy, who beats Harry for disobeying him, they conceal it from the adults. They view the baby as a kind of substitute for the dog that they have been denied; Davy asks his brother: \"Shall we call the baby Rover, Harry?” Grandaddy is having problems with the Dutch settlers who have arrived at the settlement in increasing numbers after leaving South Africa at the end of the Boer War. He has had a long-running dispute with Afrikaner Jan Hooft over ownership of a hill and refuses to accept a legal ruling that the land belongs to Hooft. He also keeps a close rein on his adult daughter Kirsty and is reluctant for her to make a life for herself. She is in love with the local doctor Willem Bloem, who left Holland for Canada for reasons he will not disclose. He does not seem to return her affections, but it transpires that this is because he thinks himself too old for her. To make matters worse, it turns out that the \"kidnapped\" baby is Hooft's younger daughter. When found out, Harry is tried at a court set up in the local trading store. He is suspected of taking the baby as a result of the tensions between the two families but states that he did not know her identity. Surprisingly, Hooft speaks up in his defence, stating that no harm had come to her and his older daughter should have been looking after her, but also says that it was his and his wife's fault for putting too much responsibility on the older daughter. The court official suggests that Harry be sent to a corrective school, and is immediately threatened with shooting by Grandaddy. The clerk climbs down, merely suggesting an investigation into the location of these schools in case a further kidnapping should occur. Afterwards, Grandaddy thanks Hooft for speaking up for Harry. The film ends with Grandaddy, who had never learned to read or write, instructing Harry to write to a mail order company to order the red setter they had set their hearts on. He had found the flyer for the dog in one of his best boots, where the boys had hidden it. They had noticed that he sometimes walked without these boots, slinging them over his shoulder, to save wear and tear. To pay for the dog, Grandaddy had sold them – a prized item among his few possessions. Davy is now able to say, \"I think we'll call him Rover, Harry.\" One of the film's most memorable moments comes with the horror on the face of Duncan Macrae at what his grandson must have thought of him when the little boy implores: \"Don't eat the babbie, grandaddy!\".",

    "Synopsis": "The film tells the story of the Zhurbin family, a multigenerational clan of shipbuilders. Living under one roof are grandfather Matvei, his son Ilya Matveyevich, Ilya's four sons (Victor, Konstantin, Anton, and Alexei), and his youngest daughter Antonina. The second son, Anton, returns from Leningrad to introduce a new ship assembly method. Meanwhile, the eldest son, Victor, a master model-maker, works to design a universal machine for constructing ship models. The youngest son, Alexei, stands out for his complex character and is central to the film's most challenging narrative threads. Having separated from the family to marry, Alexei faces heartbreak when his fiancée, Katya, becomes involved with a club director who abandons her after learning she is pregnant. Alexei ultimately forgives her and accepts her back, along with her child. The family faces further trials as Victor’s wife, Lida, leaves, feeling alienated in a household where every member's life revolves around shipbuilding. With the reorganization of the shipyard, many family members must adapt to new professions. Ilya Zhurbin struggles to keep up with the changes, trying to learn algebra to remain relevant. Tensions rise between Ilya and his longtime friend, foreman Basmanov, who believes their era of expertise has passed. Through these challenges, the Zhurbin family grapples with the intersections of tradition, innovation, and personal transformation.",

Then a small boy – Joe – buys a unicorn, in fact a sickly little goat, with just one twisted horn in the middle of its forehead.

    "film_title": "Bad Day at Black Rock",
    "Synopsis": "<!--plot is at maximum length; plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words per MOS:FILMPLOT-->In late 1945, one-armed John Macreedy gets off a train at Black Rock, an isolated California desert hamlet. The residents are suspicious, as this is the first time in four years that the express train has stopped at the flag stop station. After Macreedy inquires about a man named Komoko, several local men become hostile. Hastings, the telegraph agent, tells him there are no taxis; the hotel desk clerk, Pete Wirth, claims he has no vacant rooms; and Hector David threatens him. Later, Reno Smith informs Macreedy that Komoko, a Japanese-American, was interned during World War II. Alcoholic Sheriff Tim Horn is no help locating Komoko. Doc Velie, the veterinarian and undertaker, advises Macreedy to leave town immediately, but lets slip that Komoko is dead. Liz, Pete's sister, rents a Jeep to Macreedy. Driving to nearby Adobe Flat, Macreedy finds a homestead burned to the ground and wildflowers growing in the field. On the drive back, Coley Trimble tries to run Macreedy off the road. Macreedy tries to leave town, but Liz refuses to rent him the Jeep again, having been confronted by Smith. Asked by Smith about his missing left arm, Macreedy says he lost it fighting in Italy. Macreedy then postulates that the wildflowers at the Komoko place indicate a body is buried there. Smith reveals that he is virulently anti-Japanese; he tried to enlist in the Marine Corps the day after the Pearl Harbor attack but failed the Marines' physical examination. Macreedy tries to telephone the state police, but Pete refuses to connect the call. Doc Velie admits that something terrible happened four years ago, but Smith has everyone too terrified to speak openly about it. Velie offers his hearse to Macreedy to leave town, but Hector disables it. Writing a telegram to the California police to summon help, Macreedy gives it to Hastings. At the diner, Trimble provokes a fight with Macreedy. Despite having only one arm, Macreedy thoroughly beats Trimble using martial arts. Confronting Smith, Macreedy accuses him of killing Komoko with the complicity of others. Hastings arrives and tries to give Smith a piece of paper; snatching the paper, Macreedy finds his unsent telegram. Informing Hastings he has broken the law, Macreedy and Velie demand that Horn take action. Horn attempts to arrest Hastings, but Smith pulls the sheriff's badge off Horn's shirt and pins it on Hector, who casually tears up the telegram. After Smith and Hector leave, Macreedy declares that the loss of his arm had left him wallowing in self-pity, but Trimble's attempt to kill him has reinvigorated him. Komoko's son died in combat saving his life, and Macreedy came to give Komoko his son's medal. He learned that Smith leased farmland to Komoko that Smith was sure had no water, but Komoko dug a well and found water. After Pearl Harbor, when Smith was rejected for military service, he and the other men began drinking and decided to harass the Japanese Komoko. Komoko barricaded himself inside his home, which the men then set on fire. When Komoko emerged ablaze, Smith shot and killed him. Under the cover of darkness, Doc and Pete enlist Liz to help Macreedy escape. Outside the hotel, Pete and Doc lure away Hector and knock him unconscious. Liz drives Macreedy out of town but stops at Adobe Flat, setting up Macreedy. Smith shoots at Macreedy, who shelters behind the Jeep. Liz rushes to Smith despite Macreedy's warning. Telling Liz that she and the rest of his accomplices must die, Smith shoots her in the back as she flees. Finding a bottle, Macreedy fills it with gasoline from the Jeep and makes a Molotov cocktail. When Smith moves around the rocks for a better shot, Macreedy throws the Molotov cocktail at Smith, setting Smith on fire. Back in town, Macreedy arrives with Smith and the body of Liz. The state police are called and arrests are made. As Macreedy leaves, Velie requests Komoko's medal to help Black Rock heal from the terrible events. Macreedy gives it to him before boarding the train.",

    "film_title": "Carmen Jones (film)",
    "Synopsis": "Set during World War II, the story focuses on Carmen Jones, a \"shameless vixen\" who works in a parachute factory in North Carolina. When she is arrested for fighting with a co-worker who reported her for arriving late for work, the leader of the Army guards, Sgt. Brown, assigns handsome Corporal Joe to deliver her to the civilian authorities over 50 miles away. This is much to the dismay of Joe's fiancée Cindy Lou, who had agreed to marry him during his leave prior to his reporting for flight school and an eventual officer's commission. Joe plans to deliver his prisoner as soon as possible to return to Cindy Lou and his leave. While en route, he decides to save time by taking his jeep over a road warned unsuitable for motor vehicles that is half the distance to the town where he is taking Carmen. Carmen suggests she and Joe stop for a meal and a little romance, and his refusal intensifies her determination to seduce him. Their army jeep ends up hopelessly stuck in a river. Carmen suggests they spend the night at her grandmother's house nearby and continue their journey by train the following day, and that night Joe succumbs to Carmen's advances. The next morning, he awakens to find a note in which she says although she loves him, she is unable to deal with time in jail and is running away. Joe is demoted to private and locked in the stockade for allowing his prisoner to escape. Cindy Lou arrives for a visit just as a rose from Carmen is delivered to him, prompting her to leave abruptly. Having found work in a Louisiana nightclub, Carmen awaits his release. One night, champion prizefighter Husky Miller enters with an entourage and introduces himself to Carmen, who expresses no interest in him. Husky orders his manager Rum Daniels to offer her jewelry, furs, and an expensive hotel suite if she and her friends Frankie and Myrt accompany him to Chicago, but she declines the offer. Just then, Joe arrives and announces he must report to flying school immediately. Angered, Carmen decides to leave with Sgt. Brown, who also has appeared on the scene, and Joe severely beats him. Realizing he will be sentenced to a long prison term for hitting his superior, Joe flees on a train to Chicago with Carmen. Tired of being cooped up in a shabby rented room, Carmen gets dressed and leaves under the guise of buying groceries. Since he can't leave the room at all lest he be arrested, Joe questions her. Carmen becomes annoyed and tells him that she does what she wants. Carmen goes to Husky Miller's gym to ask Frankie for a loan, saying that although she has clothes, furs and diamonds, she has no actual cash. Frankie tries to convince Carmen to sit in Husky's corner so they all can be well taken care of, but Carmen is in love and refuses to double time Joe. Husky believes she is back to finally be with him, but she refuses his advances before leaving, so he tells his entire entourage that they are cut off financially until they produce Carmen (whom he nicknames Heatwave). Carmen pawns a piece of jewelry so she can buy groceries before returning to the room. When she returns not only with a bag of groceries but a new dress and shoes, Joe questions how she paid for them. Offended that he is accusing her of cheating, she argues with him and goes to Husky's hotel suite dressed in her new clothes to spend time with her friends. Frankie begins to tell fortunes by drawing cards. Carmen takes it all lightly until she draws the nine of spades. She interprets it as a premonition of her impending death and chooses to enjoy the rest of her life no matter how long it is. Cindy Lou arrives at Husky's gym in search of Carmen since she is the only one who knows where Joe is. Frankie tells her to give up on Joe because he is nothing but trouble. An angry Joe arrives, having evaded capture and intent on getting Carmen back. Although Cindy Lou is present, he ignores her while ordering Carmen to leave with him. Husky intervenes and he is threatened by a concealed knife Joe has brought with him. Husky's people try to get him to stand down due to his fighting prowess, but can't since Joe won't stop. Joe is hit with a few blows before Carmen helps him get away. Joe asks why if she no longer loves him, but she reveals it's because she can't bear to see anyone cooped up. She tells Cindy Lou to go home and find someone worthy of her. After leaving, Cindy Lou tells herself how silly it is trying to save a man who not only doesn't love her but has left her for another woman. Joe escapes the Military Police and attends Husky's big fight. Dressed to the nines, Carmen, her friends and Husky's entourage escort Husky to the ring. He falters in the first round, but comes back to beat his opponent in the second. Husky runs to Carmen's loving arms after winning, but they are parted after he is put up on his entourage's shoulders. Joe grabs Carmen as she is following Husky to his dressing room and pulls her into a storage room, where he begs her to return to him. Angry that she has moved on, he claims he should have killed her. In a matter-of-fact manner, she tells him that what they had is over and there is no going back for them. When Carmen continues to rebuff him and says he needs to kill her or let her go, Joe strangles her to death. A janitor finds him as he goes to alert the military police. He realizes he is now going to die for committing murder.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1917, during World War I, in the central California towns of Monterey and Salinas, Caleb \"Cal\" and Aron are young adult fraternal twins who live in the Salinas Valley with their father Adam Trask, a farmer and wartime draft board chairman. Adam is a deeply religious Christian. Aron is pious, dutiful, and responsible, while Cal is moody, embittered, and thinks that he is sinful. He believes his father loves only his brother Aron. Adam told the boys their mother, Kate, died when they were infants. However, Cal discovers Kate operates a brothel in nearby Monterey, though he keeps this information from Adam and Aron. Adam's idealistic plan for a long-haul vegetable shipping enterprise ends disastrously, losing his entire fortune. To recoup his father's loss, and to earn his father's love, Cal decides to enter the bean-growing business, knowing that if the United States enters the war, bean prices will skyrocket. Cal borrows the $5,000 capital he needs from Kate. Kate reveals to Cal that she deserted the family because she hated living on the farm, that she never loved Adam, and rebelled against his completely controlling her. She shot Adam in the shoulder when he attempted to stop her leaving. In lending Cal the money, Kate notes the irony that the loan proceeds from her business are intended to preserve Adam's goodness. Meanwhile, Aron's girlfriend, Abra, is growing attracted to Cal, who seems to reciprocate her feelings. Cal's bean venture is successful, and he intends to give the profits to Adam at a surprise birthday party that he and Abra have planned. As the party begins, Aron suddenly announces that he and Abra are engaged. While Adam is openly pleased, both Abra and Cal are uneasy due to their growing feelings for one another. Cal presents the money to his father; however, Adam refuses it, claiming it is war profiteering and demands he give it back to the farmers he \"robbed.\" Adam adds that Aron's gift, compared to Cal's, is \"honest and...good.\" A confused Cal sees his father's refusal as just another emotional rejection. When a distraught Cal leaves the room, Abra goes after him. Aron follows and orders Cal to stay away from her. Cal angrily tells Aron that their mother is alive, then takes him to her Monterey bordello. Cal roughly shoves the stunned Aron at the elderly Kate, causing her to fall. When Cal arrives home, Adam demands to know where Aron is. Cal initially responds that he is \"not his brother's keeper\" then tells Adam what he did. The truth about his mother drives the pacifistic Aron to get drunk, lose control, and then board a troop train to enlist in the army. When the sheriff informs Adam, he rushes to the station in a futile attempt to dissuade him. Adam fails and watches helplessly as Aron smashes his head through the rail car window, maniacally laughing as the train pulls away. A shocked Adam suffers a stroke, leaving him paralyzed and unable to communicate. Cal tries talking to Adam, but Adam is unresponsive. Abra pleads with Adam to show Cal some affection before it is too late. When Cal makes his last bid for acceptance before leaving town, Adam manages to speak. He tells Cal to fire the annoying nurse, then whispers something to him. Cal tells Abra that Adam said he wants only Cal to care for him. Cal sits alone by his father's bedside, the emotional chasm between the father and son apparently healing, with Cal presumably staying to care for him.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1948, just four hours and 45 minutes before a ceasefire takes effect, Captain Yehuda Berger instructs four volunteers - James Finnegan, an Irish former British policeman (who fell in love with a Jewish woman named Miriam Miszrahi); Allan Goodman, a tourist from the USA who fell in love with the struggle to found Israel; David Airan; and (at her insistence) Esther Hadassi (a Yemeni Jewish woman) - to take and hold the strategic \"Hill 24\", one of a number of hills dominating the highway into Jerusalem. Afterward, Finnegan relates how he first met Berger in 1946, two years before the start of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, while serving as a British policeman in Haifa. In a flashback, Finnegan is part of the police force rounding up Jews who came ashore in British-controlled Mandatory Palestine illegally at night. Finnegan finds an ailing Berger and Miriam Miszrahi, and goes to find medical help for Berger. He is relieved to learn that the pair escaped. Berger is a concentration camp survivor who arrived in Palestine illegally during the British Mandate period and joined the Jewish Brigade group to help other Jews make Aliyah Bet. Later Finnegan and Berger encounter one another at a checkpoint, where Berger is identified. Finnegan's superior lets Berger go, ordering Sergeant Finnegan to follow him and apprehend his associates. Berger spots the police tailing him and flees. The two policemen follow him all the way to an apartment, which turns out to be Miriam's, but Berger manages to get away. When Miriam gets home, she finds the police in her apartment. Miriam, a fourth generation local resident studying to be a teacher, is taken in for questioning and detained under the Emergency Defence Regulations. She is questioned about her relationship with Berger and the Jewish Underground. As she is being questioned Berger, who has been apprehended, is brought into the station. Miriam is released the next morning. Finnegan and Browning are ordered to keep her under surveillance. After several fruitless days, Lawson tells Finnegan he can make Miriam's acquaintance, much to Finnegan's delight. Finnegan falls in love with her and he convinces her to return to Haifa with him, where she is arrested by Finnegan's superior. Miriam later joins the army to fight in the 1948 War, and Finnegan joins also. He reveals to his fellow soldiers that he is an Irish Christian. Miriam and Finnegan meet briefly as Finnegan is deployed to Hill 24. As they drive towards the site of the operation Goodman, a New Yorker, tells the story of how he and Hadassi first met when he was wounded during the battle for the Old City. Hadassi, working as a nurse, helped care for him until the forces surrendered. They then signed up for Berger's unit together. The four die on the hill. Hadassi's body is found still clutching an Israeli flag. It is declared that the Hill has been claimed for Israel.",

She at first intends to give the baby to one of the Aboriginal women who work on the station, but then raises Jedda as her own, teaching her European ways and separating her from other Aboriginal people. Jedda wants to learn about her own culture, but is forbidden by Sarah. When Jedda grows into a young woman, she becomes curious about an Aboriginal man from the bush named Marbuck. This tall stranger arouses strong feelings in her. She is lured to his camp one night by a song. Marbuck abducts her and sets off back to his tribal land, through crocodile-infested swamps. Joe, a half-caste stockman in love with Jedda, tracks the two for several days. They travel across high, rocky country, and down a river until Marbuck reaches his tribe. The tribal council declares that Marbuck has committed a serious crime by bringing Jedda to them, because she is not of the right skin group. They sing his death song as punishment. Marbuck defies the elders and takes Jedda into an area of steep cliffs and canyons, taboo lands. Driven insane by the death song, he pulls Jedda with him over a tall cliff, and both perish. Joe, the narrator, says her spirit has joined \"the great mother of the world, in the dreaming time of tomorrow\".",

    "Synopsis": "Marty Piletti is an Italian-American butcher who lives in The Bronx with his mother. Unmarried at 34, the good-natured but socially awkward Marty faces constant badgering from customers, family, and friends to settle down as they point out that all of his brothers and sisters are married, most of them with children. Not averse to marriage but disheartened by his lack of prospects, Marty has reluctantly resigned himself to bachelorhood. After being harassed by his mother into going to the Stardust Ballroom one Saturday night, Marty connects with Clara, a plain high school science teacher, who is weeping outside on the roof after being abandoned by her blind date. Marty and Clara spend the evening together dancing, walking the busy streets, and talking in a diner. Marty eagerly spills out his life story and ambitions, and they encourage each other. He takes Clara to his house, where he awkwardly tries to kiss her and is rebuffed. Clara explains that she just didn't know how to handle the situation; she does like him and wants to see him again. They kiss briefly and embrace. At this point, Marty's mother returns, not pleased to see her son with a strange woman. Marty takes Clara home by bus, promising to call her at 2:30 the next afternoon, after Mass. Overjoyed on his way back home, he punches the bus stop sign and weaves between the cars, looking for a cab instead. Meanwhile, Marty's Aunt Catherine reluctantly moves in with Marty and his mother. Catherine privately warns her sister that Marty will soon marry and cast her aside. Fearing that Marty's new romance could spell her abandonment, his mother belittles Clara to Marty the next day before Mass. Marty's friends, with an undercurrent of envy, deride Clara for her plainness. They try to convince Marty to forget her and remain with them, unmarried, in their fading youth. Harangued into submission by the pull of his friends, Marty fails to call Clara. That night, back in the same lonely rut, Marty realizes that he is giving up a woman whom he not only likes but who makes him happy. Over his friends' objections, he dashes to a phone booth to call Clara, who is disconsolately watching television with her parents. When his friend Angie asks what he's doing, Marty bursts out: Just before calling Clara, Marty needles Angie with the same words he's heard so often himself: \"Hey, Ange, when are *you* gonna get married? You should be ashamed of yourself.\" Marty closes the phone booth door when Clara answers the phone. In the last line of the film, Marty says, \"Hello...Hello, Clara?\"",

    "film_title": "Miracle of Marcelino",
    "Synopsis": "The story revolves around Marcelino, an orphan abandoned as a baby on the steps of a monastery in nineteenth-century Spain. The monks raise the child, and Marcelino grows into a rowdy young boy. He has been warned by the monks not to visit the monastery attic, where a \"very big man who will take him away\" lives, but he ventures upstairs anyway, sees the man and tears off back down the stairs. At a festival, Marcelino causes havoc when he accidentally topples a pile of fruit and lets some animals loose. The new local mayor, a blacksmith whom the monks would not let adopt Marcelino because of his coarse behaviour, uses the incident as an excuse to try to shut down the monastery. Given the silent treatment by the monks, Marcelino gathers up the courage to once again enter the attic, where he sees not a bogeyman, but a beautiful statue of Christ on the Cross. Remarking that the statue looks hungry, Marcelino steals some bread and wine and offers it to the statue, which comes to life, descends from the Cross, and eats and drinks what the boy has brought him. The statue becomes Marcelino's best friend and begins to give him religious instruction. For his part, Marcelino realizes that the statue is Christ. The monks know something is strange when they notice bread and wine disappearing, and arrange to spy on Marcelino. One day, the statue notices that Marcelino is pensive and brooding instead of happy, and tells him that he would like to reward his kindness. Marcelino answers: \"I want only to see my mother, and to see Yours after that\". The statue cradles Marcelino in its arms, tells Marcelino to sleep - and Marcelino dies happy. The monks witness the miracle through a crack in the attic door and burst in just in time to see the dead Marcelino bathed in a heavenly glow. The statue returns to its place on the Cross, and Marcelino is buried underneath the chapel and venerated by all who visit the now flourishing monastery-turned-shrine. The main story is told in flashback by a monk (played by Fernando Rey) to a dying girl for inspiration. The film ends with the monk entering the now completely remodelled chapel in the monastery during Mass, and saying to the crucifix once kept in the attic: \"We have been speaking about You, O Lord\", and then, to Marcelino's grave, which is situated nearby, \"And about you, too, Marcelino.\"",

    "Synopsis": "Tony \"le Stéphanois\", a criminal who has served a five-year prison term for a jewel heist, is out on the street and down on his luck. His friend Jo approaches him about a smash-and-grab proposed by mutual friend Mario in which the trio would cut the glass on a Parisian jeweler's front window in broad daylight and snatch some gems. Tony declines. He then learns that his old girlfriend, Mado, took up in his absence with gangster Parisian nightclub owner Pierre Grutter. Finding Mado working at Grutter's, Tony invites her back to his rundown flat. She is obviously well-kept, and Tony savagely beats her for being so deeply involved with Grutter. Tony changes his mind about the heist; he now accepts on the condition that rather than merely robbing the window, they will take on the more difficult but more lucrative task of robbing the store's safe. Mario suggests they employ the services of Italian compatriot César, a safecracker. The four devise and rehearse an ingenious plan to break into the store and disable its sophisticated alarm system. The caper begins with the group chiseling through a cement ceiling from an upstairs flat on a Sunday night. The suspenseful break-in is completed, and the criminals appear to escape without leaving any trace of their identities. However, without the others' knowledge, César pocketed a diamond ring as a bauble for his lover Viviane, a chanteuse at Grutter's club. The heist makes headline news and the four men arrange to fence the loot with a London contact. Meanwhile, Grutter has seen Mado and her injuries, and she breaks off their relationship. Infuriated at Tony's interference in his life, Grutter gives heroin to his drug-addicted brother Rémy and tells him to murder Tony. But then, the other Grutter brother, Louis, shows them the diamond César gave to Viviane and they realize that César, Mario, and Tony were responsible for the jewel theft. Grutter forces César to confess. Forsaking a FF10&nbsp;million police reward, Grutter decides to steal the jewels from Tony's gang, with Rémy brutally murdering Mario and his wife Ida when they refuse to reveal where the loot is hidden. Tony retrieves it from the couple's apartment and anonymously pays for a splendid funeral for them. He then goes looking for Grutter and stumbles onto the captive César, who confesses having squealed. Citing \"the rules,\" Tony ruefully kills him. Meanwhile, seeking to force their adversaries' hand, Grutter's thugs kidnap Jo's five-year-old son Tonio and hold him for ransom. The London fence arrives with the payoff, after which Tony leaves to single-handedly rescue the child by force, advising Jo it is the only way they will see him alive. With Mado's help, he tracks Tonio down at Grutter's country house and kills Rémy and Louis while rescuing him. On the way back to Paris, Tony learns Jo has cracked under the pressure and agreed to meet Grutter at his house with the money. When Jo arrives Grutter tells him Tony has already snatched the child and kills him. Seconds too late to save his friend, Tony is mortally wounded by Grutter but kills him as Grutter tries to flee with the loot. Bleeding profusely, Tony drives maniacally back to Paris and delivers Tonio home safely before dying at the wheel as police and bystanders close in on him and a suitcase filled with FF120&nbsp;million in cash. Jo's wife, Louise, takes her child from the car and leaves the suitcase and the body to police.",

Her innate independence and assertive nature lead her to numerous passionate love affairs. While with Aleko, son of a wealthy family, she decides, as is her habit, to break up before the relationship wears off. Once she meets Miltos, a young soccer player, she seems to change. At first, she avoids his advances, but, later, gives in to him. However, she can only be with him on her own terms. No matter how much she loves him, she mostly values her freedom. Things turn complicated when she is called to choose. She repeatedly rejects Miltos' marriage proposals. When Miltos finally forces her to accept the idea of marriage, Stella does not appear in church, despite Miltos repeatedly warning her that he will kill her if she doesn't marry him. (The wedding day shares a date with the day that Greece rejects Mussolini's demands to let his fascist forces enter Greece.)

Director Bernie Dodd watches a number performed by fading star Frank Elgin and suggests that he be cast in the leading role. This is met with strong opposition from Philip Cook, the show's producer. However, Bernie insists on the down-on-his-luck Frank, who is living in a modest apartment with his wife Georgie. thumb|left|150px|Drive-in theater|Drive-in advertisement from 1955 Frank is actually a demanding alcoholic who is completely dependent on his wife. Initially Frank leads Bernie to believe that Georgie is the reason for the decline in his career, resulting in Bernie mistakenly blaming her for everything that happens during rehearsals, including Frank's requests for a dresser and a run-of-the-show contract, first behind her back and eventually to her face. The real reason Frank's career has faltered is his insecurity. When their five-year-old son Johnny was hit by a car and died while in Frank's care, he was devastated. Bernie also believed Georgie to be suicidal and a drunk, when it is actually Frank who is both. Humiliated when he learns the truth, Bernie realizes that behind his hatred of Georgie was a strong attraction to her, and he kisses her. She tells him that it does not mean that anything has changed. Frank's performance is a success on opening night. Afterward, he demands respect from Cook. Previously Georgie had said that if only Frank could stand on his own two feet, she could get away from him. At a party to celebrate the play's opening, Bernie believes Georgie will be free to leave Frank and tells her that he loves her. Later, Frank tells them he has noticed their longing looks, and all three talk. Shortly after, Frank leaves the party. Georgie says goodbye to Bernie, and he tells her he appreciates a woman who is loyal. She kisses him lightly and goes to catch up with Frank.",

    "film_title": "The Crucified Lovers",
    "Synopsis": "In Edo-period Japan, Mohei is an apprentice to Ishun, the wealthy grand scroll-maker of Kyoto. Mohei loyally serves his boss and works long hours for him. He has traditional views of morality and supports a sentence of crucifixion for an adulterous couple, even after he is reminded of Japan's double standard for wealthy men who cheat on their wives. Ishun's tightfistedness and immorality force Mohei to rethink his simplistic, duty-bound worldview. When Ishun pressures his maid Otama to sleep with him, she lies that she and Mohei are engaged. Mohei refuses to go along with the ruse, arguing that an employee's duty is to serve their employer, even if it means being raped. However, neither does he expose Otama's deception. In addition, Ishun's wife Osan ropes Mohei into her family's financial difficulties. Ishun refuses to bail out Osan's family business, so Osan (whose mother forced her to marry Ishun for his money) begs Mohei to steal money from Ishun. Mohei is secretly in love with Osan and agrees to forge a money order for her. Osan's plan fails when Mohei refuses to bribe a coworker who catches him; the coworker promptly turns him in to Ishun. Osan is about to confess, but Otama suddenly claims responsibility, hoping that her lie will protect Mohei. This backfires, as Ishun still thinks Otama is engaged to Mohei and decides to sideline his romantic rival. He puts Mohei under house arrest. In the evening, Otama informs Osan that Ishun is cheating on her. The women devise a plan to have Osan catch her husband in the act by switching rooms for the night. However, Mohei accidentally derails the plan by escaping to meet Otama (whose room is occupied by Osan). While Mohei and Osan argue about whether Mohei should flee, Ishun's aide Sukeyemon catches them together and infers adultery. After returning from a night of carousing with geisha, Ishun hypocritically accuses his wife of adultery and directs her to commit suicide to protect the family name. However, while Ishun is distracted, Osan flees and links up with Mohei. Otama is allowed to quit her job. The fugitives discover that Ishun has alerted the police to Mohei's forgery, but not his wife's purported adultery. Under shogunate law, failing to report a crime is itself a crime. However, Ishun does not want to admit his wife left him, which would scandalize his wealthy clients. Ishun's business rival Isan learns of the cover-up and conspires with Sukeyemon to reveal it at the right time so that he can destroy Ishun's company. Osan and Mohei decide to commit suicide together. They change their minds when Mohei professes his love for Osan, and fake their deaths in Lake Biwa. After finding refuge in the mountains, Mohei tries to run away, reasoning that if he is gone, Ishun will take Osan back. However, Osan catches him and pledges her loyalty to him. Ishun soon learns Osan and Mohei are alive. He uses his financial power and threats of collective punishment to turn Osan and Mohei's families against them. Mohei's father, who rents land from Ishun, betrays his own son and helps Ishun's henchmen kidnap Osan. When Osan refuses to see Ishun and returns to her family home, Ishun pays Osan's family to shame her into coming back. Mohei's father allows Mohei to flee to Osan's family home, but Osan's mother urges him to leave. When he declines, she tries to betray him to Ishun's henchmen, but the lovers run away together. At this point, Isan tips off the police about Ishun's failure to report his wife's adultery. The police apprehend Mohei and Osan, but they also banish Ishun and Sukeyemon and strip them of their wealth. Before crucifying the lovers, the police parade Mohei and Osan through the streets of Kyoto. Their coworker remarks that she has never seen Osan so happy.",

    "Synopsis": "Writer Maurice Bendrix settles in London in 1943–44 after being wounded in the war. His affair with Sarah Miles, wife of civil servant Henry Miles, \"grows into a deep and abiding passion.\" Maurice becomes jealous. He wants to marry Sarah, but she won't leave Henry yet. Maurice's apartment is hit by a buzz bomb. He revives and pulls himself from the rubble to find Sarah kneeling on the floor. As she tends to his wounds, he asks her why she was kneeling. She says she was praying and was certain he was dead. She stares at him, her face wet with tears, then leaves abruptly. He runs after her, but finds the street empty. Maurice suffers from delayed shock and is bedridden for several days. When he recovers, he tries in vain to reach Sarah and his \"jealousy turns to hate.\" A year later, the war is over. Maurice struggles with his book and his hate for Sarah. One rainy night, he sees Henry. Henry is worried about Sarah and invites Maurice over for a drink. Sarah, who \"is out at all hours,\" returns soaking wet, and is vague and detached with Maurice and Henry. Maurice confronts Sarah, who takes all the blame. Parkis, a private investigator, reports to Maurice in the darkened flat. He describes Maurice's meeting with Sarah in detail, interpreting it as a final parting and describing Sarah as \"looking ready to weep her eyes out.\" Maurice reveals himself, saying the parting was long ago. Parkis has the bottom of a discarded note in Sarah's handwriting that reads \"Nothing matters except that we should be together, now and forever.\" Parkis obtains Sarah's journal, observing that she appears to be very ill. As Maurice reads the journal, we hear Sarah's voice describing the past year. Maurice lies in the rubble. Sarah takes his hand, then returns to his room. Weeping, she prays: \"I love him, I'll do anything... I'll give Maurice up forever, only just let him be alive!\" Maurice calls her name. She plans to tell him about her \"hysterical\" promise, but then he seems to remember what it was like to be dead. \"Now the agony of being without you starts,\" she writes. At home, Henry tells her that Maurice has been taken to a hospital with delayed shock. Suddenly Sarah wants Maurice beside her. She confides in a Catholic priest and asks: \"What does God want with me?\" She lights a candle and for the first time in months feels \"a little tremble of happiness.\" At home, she finds Maurice with Henry. It took \"everything she had\" to walk up the stairs. She writes a love letter, records it in the diary and tears it up, creating the scrap of paper Parkis found. She tells her friend, Richard Smythe, she is going back to Maurice because she believes God will love her even if she breaks her vow. But when Henry tells her how much he needs her, she promises not to leave him. The diary ends with a cry of pain and love for Maurice. He closes the journal and phones her. She begs him not to come. He pursues her to the church through pouring rain, promising they will be together. Maurice comes to the house and finds Sarah is dying. At home, he finds a letter from Sarah that says she can never see him again, and that she has never loved as she loves him. Maurice replies: \"Have it your way, Sarah. I believe that you live and that He exists. But I'm tired. Just give me a little time...\"",

    "Synopsis": "Kiichi Nakajima (Toshiro Mifune) is an elderly foundry owner who is convinced he and his loved ones will all be killed in an imminent nuclear war if they stay in Japan, so he resolves to move them to perceived safety in Brazil. He does not care that no one else wants to go or that it might make things awkward that he wants to bring his three illegitimate children and two surviving mistresses along with his wife and the four children they have together, saying that nothing is more important than their continued survival. Kiichi's three oldest children convince his wife to try to have him ruled incompetent in order to keep him from wasting their inheritance on his plan, and they bring him before a three-man arbitration panel that includes Dr. Harada (Takashi Shimura). Harada, a dentist who volunteers with the family court, sympathizes with Kiichi's concerns and points out that the fear of nuclear weapons is present in every citizen of Japan. He wonders aloud whether it may be wrong to rule someone incompetent simply for being more worried than the average citizen, but the panel eventually decides that Kiichi's irrational behavior justifies removing his ability to make the financial decisions for his family by himself. After this, Kiichi tries to find a way to move forward with the move anyway, but his efforts fail, and his mental state begins to deteriorate more rapidly once he no longer feels as though he is doing anything to save himself and his family from the nuclear holocaust he is sure is coming. Growing increasingly desperate, he decides that his family will be willing to go with him to South America if they no longer have jobs or a source of income tying them to Japan, and he burns down the foundry. When this is discovered, his distress reaches a breaking point after some of his employees point out that his actions indicate he is unconcerned about their lives and his son-in-law argues that there are already more than enough nuclear weapons to destroy all life on this planet and nowhere is really safe. Harada goes to visit Kiichi at the psychiatric facility to which he has been sent. While waiting to be shown to his room, Harada talks with a psychologist, who remarks that he has found Kiichi's case particularly troubling personally, since it has made him wonder whether it may be more insane to ignore the nuclear threat than it is to take it too seriously. Harada discovers that Kiichi believes he has escaped to another planet and that he has become severely withdrawn from his surroundings. During the visit, however, Kiichi becomes agitated when he sees the Sun through his window and thinks it is the Earth burning.",

    "Synopsis": "Eight-year-old Lillian Roth is constantly pushed by her domineering stage mother Katie to audition and act. When Lillian is a young adult, Katie secures an opportunity that launches her musical career. Even though 20 years have passed, Katie still is managing Lillian, as well as running her life and career choices. Lillian learns that her childhood friend David is in the hospital, and they soon fall in love. Because David is an entertainment company lawyer, he is able to secure Lillian shows at some large venues, including the Palace Theatre. However, David feels that Katie is projecting her own ambitions onto Lillian and overworking her, and Katie believes that a new man in Lillian's life only serves to distract from her high-profile career. When Lillian informs her mother she intends to marry David, Katie is disappointed and sees a repeat of her own life happening. David suddenly falls ill and dies during the opening night of Lillian's show, and she is despondent at having lost the love of her life. Rebelling against her mother's domineering ways, Lillian turns to drinking. One night, in a drunken stupor, she marries aviator Wallie but does not remember it when sober. They remain married, but the marriage is loveless from the beginning and they both drink to excess. Lillian's career suffers as a result of her persistent alcoholism, and she spends all of her money without booking new shows. The couple divorces after Wallie says he is \"sick of being Mr. Lillian Roth\". Two years later, Lillian falls for fellow alcoholic Tony Bardeman. However, Lillian endures alcohol withdrawal when she stops drinking to please her mother, and she instead becomes a secret drinker. Lillian begs Tony to stay with her and they agree to stop drinking together, but once they are married, Tony starts to drink and Lillian is outraged. When she tries to stop him from drinking and leave him, he beats her. She escapes Tony's clutches and travels to New York to live with her mother but contemplates suicide after they fight. Lillian takes refuge in an Alcoholics Anonymous shelter but suffers bouts of delirium tremens as she experiences withdrawal. She begins to fall for her sponsor Burt McGuire, but the crippling effects of childhood polio make him wary of a relationship. As Lillian continues her recovery, she is invited to appear on the This Is Your Life television program to share her story of alcoholism and recovery.",

    "Synopsis": "The film tells the tragic story of Othello, a fearless Moor and general of the Venetian Republic, portrayed by Sergey Bondarchuk. He captivates Desdemona (Irina Skobtseva), the beautiful daughter of Brabantio (Yevgeny Teterin), with tales of his extraordinary life. Swayed by his courage and intellect, Desdemona falls in love with him, and they marry in secret. However, the union is met with outrage when the envious Venetian nobleman Rodrigo (Yevgeny Vesnik) and the spiteful ensign Iago (Andrey Popov) inform Brabantio of the marriage. Desdemona openly declares her love for Othello, defying her father's disapproval before the Doge of Venice. As a Turkish fleet threatens Venice, Othello is sent to Cyprus, where he achieves a decisive victory. Iago, driven by ambition and hatred, begins a campaign of deceit to discredit Othello's trusted lieutenant, Cassio (Vladimir Soshalsky), and take his place. Manipulating events, Iago orchestrates Cassio's disgrace and gains Othello's trust by feigning loyalty. Iago's cunning extends to exploiting Desdemona's kindness as she advocates for Cassio's reinstatement, planting seeds of jealousy and mistrust in Othello's mind. Using a handkerchief—Desdemona's misplaced token of affection—as fabricated evidence, Iago fuels Othello's growing suspicion. In a tragic culmination, Othello, consumed by jealousy, strangles Desdemona. Emilia (Antonina Maksimova), Iago's wife, reveals her husband's treachery, prompting Iago to murder her in a fit of rage. As the truth comes to light, Othello, overwhelmed with grief and remorse, takes his own life. The film concludes with a somber image: a funeral ship bearing the bodies of Othello and Desdemona sails into the sunset, while the disgraced and shackled Iago faces justice.",

    "Synopsis": "thumb|The film Pather Panchali (in Bengali, with subtitles)In the late-1910s in Nischindipur, rural Bengal, Harihar Roy earns a meagre living as a pujari (priest) but dreams of a better career as a poet and playwright. His wife Sarbajaya cares for their children, Durga and Apu, and Harihar's elderly cousin, Indir Thakrun. Because of their limited resources, Sarbajaya resents having to share her home with the old Indir, who often steals food from their already bare kitchen. Durga is fond of Indir and often gives her fruit stolen from a wealthy neighbour's orchard. One day, the neighbour's wife accuses Durga of stealing a bead necklace (which Durga denies) and blames Sarbajaya for encouraging her tendency to steal. As the elder sibling, Durga cares for Apu with motherly affection but spares no opportunity to tease him. Together, they share life's simple joys: sitting quietly under a tree, viewing pictures in a travelling vendor's bioscope, running after the candy man who passes through, and watching a jatra (folk theatre) performed by an acting troupe. Every evening, they are delighted by the sound of a distant train's whistle. Sarbajaya grows increasingly resentful of Indir and becomes more openly hostile, which causes Indir to take temporary refuge in the home of another relative. One day, while Durga and Apu run to catch a glimpse of the train, Indir—who is feeling unwell—goes back home, and the children find she has died upon their return. With prospects drying up in the village, Harihar travels to the city to seek a better job. He promises that he will return with money to repair their dilapidated house, but is gone longer than expected. During his absence, the family sinks deeper into poverty, and Sarbajaya grows increasingly desperate and anxious. One day during the monsoon season, Durga plays in the downpour, catches a cold and develops a high fever. Her condition worsens as a thunderstorm batters the crumbling house with rain and wind, and she dies the next morning. Harihar returns home and starts to show Sarbajaya the merchandise he has brought from the city. A silent Sarbajaya breaks down at her husband's feet, and Harihar cries out in grief as he discovers that Durga has died. The family decide to leave their ancestral home for Benaras. As they pack, Apu finds the necklace Durga had earlier denied stealing; he throws it into a pond. Apu and his parents leave the village on an ox-cart, while a snake is seen slithering into their now barren house.",

As security agents, police and a medical examiner piece together his identity, three accounts emerge: one set during World War II, one in the immediate aftermath of the war, and one in contemporary Poland. In each account, the victim seems to have been a mysterious, ambiguous presence, of shifting loyalties and suspicious connections, who set himself against the powers that be. Critics attacked the film for its depiction of a world rife with secret agents and hidden enemies—a favorite Stalinist theme—while the film seems, rather, to demonstrate how heroism and villainy are often matters of point of view and timing.",

    "Synopsis": "The film takes place in Sweden around the turn of the twentieth century. Fredrik Egerman is a middle-aged lawyer married to a 19-year-old beauty, Anne. Their two-year marriage is still unconsummated, due to Anne's reluctance. Egerman has a son, Henrik, from his marriage to his late first wife. Henrik is in his early twenties and is studying to be a minister but is currently tormented by his love for his step-mother, who secretly loves him in return. Henrik is distracting himself from his urges by attempting an inconclusive affair with Egerman's lusty young servant, Petra. Between his two marriages, Fredrik had an affair with a prominent stage actress, the beautiful Desiree Armfeldt, but she broke off the relationship. Desiree now has a young son named Fredrik Armfeldt, born shortly after her affair with Fredrik Egerman. (It is implied, but never directly stated, that little Fredrik Armfeldt is the son of Egerman.) Desiree is now having an affair with an army officer, Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm. The Count's wife, Charlotte, is an old friend of Egerman's second wife Anne. Egerman goes to see Desiree one night to pour out his marital troubles to her and ask for her help. He falls into a puddle outside Desiree's house, and Desiree dresses him in the Count's nightshirt. The violently jealous Count shows up and orders Egerman to leave. After Egerman goes, the Count and Desiree argue and subsequently decide to part amicably. When the Count returns home, he tells Charlotte about the encounter and orders her to tell Anne about Egerman's supposed infidelity (though no infidelity actually occurred). When Charlotte visits Anne, she confesses that she loves the Count despite everything, and would do anything to be loved in return. To solve these woes, Desiree has her mother invite all the characters to her country house for Midsummer Night, the shortest night of the year, a traditional observance in Sweden, when many party-goers stay awake all night until dawn. Desiree and Charlotte become temporary allies. Henrik and Anne, unexpectedly finding themselves alone together in a bedroom, consummate their relationship and elope with the assistance of Petra and her new lover Frid, another servant. Charlotte then joins Egerman in the garden pavilion. Learning his wife is with Egerman, the Count bursts in and challenges Fredrik to a game of Russian roulette. Egerman loses, but the Count had loaded the revolver with soot so neither party was ever in danger. The Count reunites with his wife, his feelings for her renewed by his jealousy. Desiree comforts Egerman, and he asks her not to leave him. The dilemmas of the four pairs of lovers appear to be happily resolved in the course of a night, said by Frid to have smiled three smiles upon them all.",

    "Synopsis": "Sportswriter Eddie Willis, broke after the newspaper he works for goes under, is hired as a PR man by boxing promoter Nick Benko. Nick has recruited Toro Moreno, a towering Argentine. Despite Toro's lack of fighting ability, Nick plans to use his size as a gimmick to draw fans to his fights. Unbeknownst to Toro and his manager, Luís Agrandi, all of his fights are fixed to make the public believe that he is a talented boxer. Eddie feels misgivings about the scheme, but the lure of a huge payday is enough to make him ignore the venture's dishonesty. He is able to spin Toro as a legitimate up-and-comer even when his first fight goes so disastrously wrong that the boxing commission threatens to open an investigation. As Benko's entourage crosses the country in a bus bedecked with advertising for the fighter, Toro gradually becomes a ranked contender. Throughout the tour, Eddie handles negotiations with other boxing managers to ensure Toro's fights remain fixed. Toro fights Gus Dundee, whose previous fight with champion Buddy Brannen has left him with a broken neck. After the Toro fight, Dundee collapses and dies. Toro is overcome with guilt, thinking he killed Dundee, and wishes to return to Argentina. In a last-ditch attempt to protect the upcoming bout with Brannen, Eddie tells Toro the truth: that Brannen was responsible for Dundee's condition, that Toro is no fighter, and that all his fights have been fixed. During the Brannen fight, Toro sustains a brutal beating. Afterward, Eddie learns that Benko has sold Toro's contract to another manager. While Eddie gets his promised payout of $26,000, Benko has rigged the accounting so Toro earns only $49.07 out of over $1 million in ticket revenue. Ashamed of his part in the farce and not wanting to see Toro exploited any further, Eddie gives Toro the $26,000 and puts him on a plane to Argentina before Benko's men can stop them. Though Benko threatens to harm Eddie, Eddie begins writing an exposé about the corruption.",

    "Synopsis": "thumb|Jennifer Jones and Gregory Peck in The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit Ten years after the end of World War II Tom Rath (Gregory Peck) is living in suburban Connecticut with his wife Betsy (Jennifer Jones) and three children. He is having difficulty supporting his family and his wife's ambitions on his writer's salary at a Manhattan nonprofit foundation. Tom is also dealing with post-traumatic stress syndrome in the form of frequent and disquieting flashbacks from his combat service as an Army captain in the European and Pacific theaters. These include actions where he killed men in combat (including, by accident, his best friend), and a brief affair with a young Italian girl named Maria (Marisa Pavan) while involved with Betsy. When a hoped-for inheritance from Tom's recently deceased grandmother turns out to have been depleted, leaving only her large and unsaleable estate, Betsy pressures Tom to seek a higher-paying job. Acting on a tip from a fellow train commuter, he applies for an opening in public relations at television network United Broadcasting Company (UBC). Asked to write his autobiography as part of the interview process, he defers in favor of a simple declaration that he wants the job, expects he can grow into it and will be happy to answer any questions directly related to his application. His forthrightness catches the attention of founding network president Ralph Hopkins (Fredric March), who seeks his help in launching a national mental health campaign Hopkins holds dear. Hopkins is powerful and highly respected but a workaholic whose success has been at the expense of his family life, leaving him estranged from his wife and rebellious daughter, who soon elopes with an unsuitable man. He is drawn to Tom's frankness and physical traits that remind him of the son he lost in World War II. Tom is initially supervised by Bill Ogden (Henry Daniell), an oily micromanager and office politician who rejects Tom's drafts of an important speech with which Hopkins intends to launch the campaign, substituting his platitude-filled draft of what Ogden thinks Hopkins wants to hear. Aware the impetus for that pitch came from Hopkins and dangerously pressured by Ogden, Tom plans to play along and accept that draft but coaxed by Betsy, presents his original ideas to Hopkins instead. Hopkins is stunned and intrigued by Tom's incisive approach and naked candor but their meeting at Hopkins' city suite is interrupted by the unwelcome news that his daughter has eloped. Deeply disturbed, Hopkins becomes reflective and relates to Tom that his son \"did the right thing\" and refused a commission in World War II and was killed in action as an enlisted man. Hopkins now regrets having ignored his family and advises Tom not to make the same mistake. Betsy abruptly sells the family's modest suburban home and moves them into Tom's late grandmother's mansion, which she derides as \"Dragonwyck\". Complications immediately ensue when Edward (Joseph Sweeney), the old woman's longtime caretaker, claims that Tom's grandmother had bequeathed him the estate. Judge Bernstein (Lee J. Cobb) intercedes and presents evidence which suggests that not only did Edward forge the bequest letter but he also padded his bills, depleting the estate and accumulating a fortune that he could not otherwise explain. The Raths are able to keep the house. At his new job, Tom runs into elevator operator Caesar (Keenan Wynn), his sergeant in Italy. Caesar is married to the cousin of his Italian flame Maria and tells Tom that Maria and her son by Tom are desperate for money in their war-ravaged country. Tom has kept his affair and possible child a secret from Betsy but goaded that evening by her admonition to always tell the truth, he now tells her. Betsy reacts angrily and speeds away recklessly in the family car. The following morning, South Bay police call to tell Tom that they have Betsy, who ran out of gas during her flight. Hopkins then calls to ask Tom to accompany him on a trip to California in support of the new campaign. Tom declines, saying that he just wants to \"work 9 to 5 and spend the rest of the time with my family\", a decision Hopkins respectfully but ruefully accepts. Tom retrieves Betsy and they reconcile. The couple then go to Judge Bernstein to set up a third-person conduit for sending funds to Tom's son in Italy. They leave together, embrace and kiss.",

    "Synopsis": "Natale, an apprentice bricklayer, and Luisa, who has no marketable skill, marry and try to live with Natale's parents and other relatives in one apartment, what might happen in the poorest classes in Rome about 1950. After a quarrel Natale and Luisa precipitately leave without a place to live. The remainder of the film is devoted to their finding housing. The solution is building a one-room brick dwelling as a squat on unused railway land on the outskirts of Rome. As it was illegal, Natale arranges his workmates to assist him during the night. According to the rules, if a dwelling has a door and a roof the householder cannot be evicted. At dawn when the police arrive to remove them the dwelling is complete except for part of the roof, but a humane policeman looks the other way. The happy ending is not without realism. In financial straits, and facing imprisonment later, Natale and Luisa, now pregnant, will encounter difficulties ahead. \"[The Roof] is a confirmation of the power of neorealist principles ... De Sica has seen to it that every incident, every detail in every shot contributes to a sense of unstrained, unforced actuality\" (Arthur Knight, Saturday Review). We have secured a recent restoration of the film that marked De Sica's final return to the classic neorealism of Bicycle Thieves after forays into romantic melodrama (Terminal Station) and Neapolitan comedy (The Gold of Naples). Two non-professional actors (one a soccer star) give winning performances as a newly married couple who, after a family quarrel, are left homeless in Rome. A bricklayer by trade, the husband conscripts his co-workers to help build an abode overnight, hoping that the police won't find the couple's new \"roof\" illegal and have it destroyed. \"A lovely little seriocomic film ... deeply touching\" (Bosley Crowther, The New York Times).",

    "film_title": "A Man Escaped",
    "Synopsis": "In Lyon, in 1943, Fontaine, a member of the French Resistance, jumps out of the car that is taking him to Montluc prison. He is immediately apprehended, and his German captors handcuff him, beat him, and lock him up. Throughout his time in prison, Fontaine regularly hears gunfire as other inmates are executed. At first, Fontaine is placed in a cell on the ground floor of Montluc. He communicates with his neighbor by tapping on the wall and is regularly able to talk through his window to Terry, a member of a small group allowed to exercise unsupervised in a courtyard. Terry takes Fontaine's letters to his family and superiors in the Resistance and gets him a safety pin so he can remove his handcuffs. After fifteen days, Fontaine is moved to a cell on the top floor of Montluc, and he is no longer required to wear handcuffs. His new neighbor, Blanchet, is an elderly man who refuses to respond to his taps on the wall. Fontaine gets to know several other inmates on his daily trips to empty his slop bucket and wash his face, even though the guards regularly admonish them for talking. After Blanchet faints while emptying his slop bucket, he and Fontaine begin to talk to each other at their windows. Fontaine notices that the wooden door of his cell is made up of thick boards joined together by a softer wood. He sharpens the end of a spoon and begins chiseling away at the joints. After weeks of slow, silent, and meticulous work—which involves keeping track of and disposing of every wood shaving, as well as camouflaging the damage he is doing to the door—he is able to get out of his cell into the hallway at will. He makes some rope using most of his linens and the wire from his bed frame. Some of Fontaine's fellow inmates begin to believe he may have found a way to escape from Montluc. Orsini, who helped alert Fontaine to approaching guards while he was chiseling at his door, asks to join the escape. Fontaine shares his plan with Orsini, but Orsini thinks it is too complicated. Instead, he tries to make a run for it one day as the inmates walk outside to empty their slop buckets. He is caught and returned to his cell to await execution. He tells Fontaine to fashion hooks to scale the prison walls from the frame of the lighting fixture in his cell. Fontaine makes more rope out of some cloth items he receives in a package, and Blanchet donates a blanket to his escape effort. However, as time goes on, the other inmates begin to doubt that Fontaine will ever really try to escape. One prisoner refuses to join his plan, calling it unrealistic. Shortly after learning that he has been sentenced to death, Fontaine is given a cellmate. The young soldier, François Jost, says he has been convicted of desertion, but Fontaine suspects he may have been planted by the Nazis to gather information. Fontaine spends time assessing Jost and ultimately decides to trust the boy and escape with him, knowing he would have to kill him otherwise. One day, Fontaine says his goodbyes and reveals his plan to Jost. Jost realizes he has no real choice and agrees, helping to make more rope. That night, the pair go into the hallway and reach the roof via a skylight. Fontaine slowly leads the way across the roof, taking advantage of the auditory cover provided by passing trains. They descend into a courtyard, where Fontaine kills a German guard. The two climb a building and hook a rope across the gap between the inner and outer walls of the prison compound, but Fontaine loses his nerve and just sits there. Hours later, he finally shimmies across the rope and drops down into the streets of Lyon. He and Jost walk away from Montluc undetected.",

During June 1941, while on leave, they take a walk near a river and spot movement in a bush.

    "Synopsis": "In Jennings County, Indiana, in 1862, Jess Birdwell is a farmer and patriarch of the Birdwell family whose Quaker religion conflicts with his love for the worldly enjoyments of music and horse racing. Jess's wife Eliza, a Quaker minister, is deeply religious and steadfastly maintains the Quaker peace testimony. Jess's daughter Mattie wants to remain a Quaker but has fallen in love with cavalry officer Gard Jordan, a love that is against her mother's wishes. Jess's elder son Josh is torn between his hatred of violence and a conviction that to protect his family he must join the home guard and fight the invaders. The family's youngest member is \"Little\" Jess, who is forever at war with his mother's pet goose. Enoch, a runaway slave, is a laborer on their farm; his children are still enslaved in the South. The story begins as a tale of Quakers trying to maintain their faith as they go to meeting on First Day (Sunday); contrasted with the Birdwells' neighbor Sam Jordan and other members of the nearby Methodist Church. The mood shifts when the meeting is interrupted by a Union officer who asks how the Quaker men can stand by when their houses will be looted and their families terrorized by approaching Confederate troops. When confronted with the question of his being afraid to fight, Josh Birdwell responds that it might be the case. His honesty provokes the wrath of Purdy, a Quaker elder who condemns people who do not believe as he does. Meanwhile, the Quakers try to maintain their ways, despite the temptations of amusements at a county fair, and a new organ (which Jess buys over Eliza's opposition). On a business trip, Jess acquires a new horse from the widow Hudspeth, and defeats Sam in their weekly horse race. One day, Jess is cultivating his fields and notices a cloud of smoke on the horizon produced by the burning of buildings. Josh arrives and tells them the neighboring community has been reduced to ash and corpses. Josh believes that he must fight, a conviction that threatens to destroy the family. Eliza tells him that by turning his back on their religion he is turning his back on her, but Jess sees things a different way. Josh finds himself on the front line of the battle to stop the advance of the raiders, and only fires his gun when the man next to him is wounded. Meanwhile, Jess is reluctant to fight, only picking up a rifle and riding off towards the fighting when the family horse gallops back to the farm riderless. When Confederates arrive at the farm, with only Eliza and the younger children present, the family and the farm are saved when Eliza greets them on the porch and welcomes them to take all the food and animals they want and feeds them in their kitchen. As Jess finds Sam Jordan dying he is bushwhacked by a \"Reb\". He plays possum and when the Confederate soldier approaches he struggles with him and takes away his gun, but ultimately lets him go free and unhurt. He then finds Josh injured and brings him home.",

    "film_title": "Funny Face",
    "Synopsis": "Maggie Prescott, a fashion magazine publisher and editor for Quality magazine, is looking for the next big fashion trend. She wants a new look which is to be both \"beautiful\" and \"intellectual\". She and top fashion photographer Dick Avery want models who can \"think as well as they look.\" The two brainstorm and come up with the idea to use a book store in Greenwich Village as backdrop. They find what they want in \"Embryo Concepts\", which is being run by the shy shop assistant and amateur philosopher, Jo Stockton. Jo thinks the fashion and modelling industry is nonsense, calling it \"chichi, and an unrealistic approach to self-impressions as well as economics\". Maggie decides to use Jo but after the first shot Jo is locked outside to keep her from interrupting Maggie’s take-over of the shop. The crew leaves the store in a shambles; Dick stays behind to help clean up and apologizes to Jo, then kisses her impulsively. Jo dismisses him, but her song \"How Long Has This Been Going On?\" shows that she feels the stirrings of romance. What Jo wants above all is to go to Paris and attend the famous Professor Émile Flostre's philosophy lectures about empathicalism. When Dick gets back to the darkroom, he sees something in Jo's face which is new and fresh and would be perfect for the campaign, giving it \"character\", \"spirit\", and \"intelligence\". They send for Jo, pretending they want to order some books from her shop. Once she arrives, they try to make her over and attempt to cut her hair. She is outraged and runs away, only to hide in the darkroom where Dick is working. When Dick mentions Paris, Jo becomes interested in the chance to see Professor Flostre and is finally persuaded to model for the magazine. Dick sings \"Funny Face\". Soon, Maggie, Dick, and Jo are off to Paris to prepare for a major fashion event, shooting photos at famous landmarks from the area. During the various shoots, Jo and Dick fall in love (\"He Loves and She Loves\"). One night, when Jo is getting ready for a gala, she learns Flostre is giving a lecture at a cafe nearby, which she attends. Eventually, Dick brings her back and they get into an argument at the gala's opening, which results in Jo being publicly embarrassed and Maggie outraged. Jo goes to talk to Flostre at his home. Through some scheming, Maggie and Dick gain entrance to the soirée there. After performing an impromptu song and dance (“Clap Yo’ Hands” from the Gershwins’ 1926 musical Oh, Kay!) for Flostre's disciples, they confront Jo and Flostre. This leads to Dick causing Flostre to fall and knock himself out. Jo urges them to leave but when Flostre comes round, he tries to seduce her. Shocked at the behavior of her \"idol\", she smashes a vase over his head and runs out, returning just in time to take part in the final fashion show. During this, Maggie tries to get in touch with Dick, who has made plans to leave Paris. Before her wedding gown finale, Jo looks out the window and sees the plane Dick was supposed to be on flying over the city. Believing that he has refused to return to her, she runs off the runway in tears at the conclusion of the show. Meanwhile, Dick is still at the airport. He runs into Flostre and learns how Jo had attacked him. Realizing how much Jo cares, Dick returns to the fashion show, but Jo is nowhere to be found. Finally, after applying the insights of empathicalism at Maggie's behest, Dick guesses that Jo would return to the church where he had photographed her in a wedding dress and they shared their first romantic moment. On his arrival there himself, he finds Jo (in the wedding gown) by a little brook. They join in the duet \"'S Wonderful\" and embrace.",

The entire film is thereafter in flashback. She recalls being 17 and having the attentions of three young men. She has had a previous kiss with the handsome but arrogant and aggressive Simon Breck and she agrees to meet him. When he makes a move on her she runs off. Nils Sorensen loves her, but is seen by Joanna only as a friend, not a suitor. She ultimately marries Alec Douglas, a gentle soul who reads poetry to her. All the men and all the local fisherman use small boats to fish for Maine lobster. Economic hardship overwhelms nearly everyone on the island, particularly Joanna's parents, the MacKenzies, as the fishing community's lobster traps start to come up empty. Worse for her, Alec amasses a large debt to Simon as a result of his gambling. It seems that Alec is stealing lobster from rival pots in order to pay his debts. One night, he is drowned: it is unclear if this is accidental but Nils takes part of the blame. Simon threatens Joanna and Nils drives him off the island, threatening to kill him. Nils offers to marry Joanna but she declines. He leaves the island soon after without saying goodbye. All three men ultimately disappear from her life. However, as the flashback ends, upon her return many years later, Joanna is pleased to once again encounter Nils.",

    "Synopsis": "It is 25 September 1944, during the last days of the Warsaw Uprising. Lieutenant Zadra leads a unit of 43 soldiers and civilians to a new position amidst the ruins of the now isolated southern Mokotów district of Warsaw. The composer Michał manages to telephone his wife and child in another part of the city that is being overrun by the Germans. After a few words, she tells him that the Germans are clearing the building and that they are coming for her. Then the line goes dead. The next morning, 23-year-old Officer Cadet Korab apologizes after walking into a room to find the second in command, Lieutenant Mądry, and messenger girl Halinka in bed together (Halinka later reveals that Mądry is her first lover). A German attack is stopped, but Korab is wounded while disabling a Goliath tracked mine. Surrounded by the enemy, Zadra is ordered to retreat through the sewers to the city centre. Now down to 27 fit to travel, including Korab, they slog through the filth. Daisy, their guide, asks Zadra to let her help Korab, claiming that the others can find their way easily enough. Zadra consents. However, the pair fall further and further behind. When they reach the designated exit at Wilcza Street, Korab is too weak to climb the upward sloping tunnel, so they rest for a while. He notices some graffiti on the opposite wall, but cannot quite make it out. Daisy tells him it says \"I love Janek\", when the name is actually Jacek, Korab's first name. She decides that they should head in the direction of the river, which is only a short distance away and drives him on, not letting him stop. Finally, they see sunlight. By this time, Korab is half blind and at the end of his strength. He cannot see that the exit is closed off by metal bars. Daisy finally reveals her feelings for him, kissing him before telling him that he can rest for a while. The main group follows Zadra for a while, but they become lost without Daisy. Finally, when Zadra tells Sergeant Kula to order them onward after a brief rest, they remain where they are. Kula lies and tells Zadra they are following in order to get him to keep going. Eventually, the only remaining soldier following Zadra and Kula is the mechanic Smukły. Meanwhile, Mądry, Halinka and Michał are also lost. Eventually, Michał loses his mind and wanders away, playing an ocarina. Upon reaching a dead end, Mądry cries out that he has somebody to live for. When Halinka asks who, he tells her that he has a wife and child. She asks him to turn off his flashlight, and then shoots herself. Mądry finds an exit, but as soon as he has climbed out of the sewer he is disarmed by a German soldier and placed into the courtyard along with others who have come through the same manhole. Despondent, he kneels beside the bodies of others who have already been executed. Zadra, Kula and Smukły miss the exit at Wilcza Street but find another - however it is booby trapped. Smukły disarms two German grenades, but is killed by the third and last. Zadra and Kula emerge from the sewer to find themselves in a deserted part of the ruined city. When Zadra tells Kula to bring up the rest of the men, Kula admits he lied and that they left them behind a long time ago. Enraged, Zadra shoots Kula and reluctantly heads back down into the sewer to search for his men.",

    "Synopsis": "Prostitute Cabiria and her lover Giorgio chase each other through a field and up to the bank of a river. Oblivious to Giorgio's criminal intentions, Cabiria stands close to the edge of the water, and he pushes her into the river and runs off with her purse and money. Her shouts for help are heard by a young boy playing nearby, and he alerts some other children and adults who rescue her from drowning. Cabiria returns to her small home, but Giorgio has disappeared. She is bitter, and when her best friend and neighbor, Wanda, tries to help her get over him, Cabiria shoos her away and remains disgruntled. One night, she is outside an upscale nightclub in town and witnesses a fight between famous movie star Alberto Lazzari and his girlfriend. The irritated Lazzari takes the star-struck Cabiria to another club where they dance the mambo, before returning to the movie star's house, where Cabiria is astounded by its opulence. The two share an intimate moment in Lazzari's bedroom, but are interrupted by the intrusion of Lazzari's previous girlfriend. Cabiria is told to wait out the night in the bathroom, and ends up watching through the keyhole of the bathroom door as Lazzari and his girlfriend reconcile their relationship. The following day, a church procession passes by the street where Cabiria and her friends hang out. As her associates mock the Church, Cabiria is drawn to the procession. Just as she is about to join the procession, a man driving a truck pulls up and offers her a ride home. As she heads home later that night, she sees a man giving food to the poor people living in caves near her house. She has never seen this man before, but she is both impressed and confused by his charity toward others. The following day, Cabiria and some of her friends attend a church mass, where she pleads with the Virgin Mary for a better life. After the procession ends, Cabiria expresses sadness at the fact that her friends seem to have not changed anything about their lives. Cabiria goes to a magic show, and the magician drags her up on stage and hypnotizes her. As the audience laugh, she acts out her desires to be married and live a happy life. Furious at having been taken advantage of for the audience's amusement, she leaves in a huff. Outside the theatre, a man named Oscar is waiting to talk to her. He was in the audience, and he says he agrees with her that it was not right for everyone to laugh, but believes that fate has brought them together. They go for a drink, and at first she is cautious and suspicious, but after several meetings she falls passionately in love with him; they are to be married after only a few weeks. Cabiria is delighted and sells her home and takes out all her money from the bank. The sum of more than 700,000 lire in cash represents her dowry, and when she shows it to Oscar in a restaurant, he advises her to keep it in the purse. However, during a walk in a wooded area, on a cliff overlooking a lake, }} Oscar becomes distant and starts acting nervous. Cabiria realizes that, just like her earlier lover, Oscar intends to steal her money. She throws her purse at his feet, sobbing in convulsions on the ground and begging for him to kill her as he takes the money and abandons her. She later picks herself up and stumbles out of the wood in tears. As Cabiria walks the road back to town, she encounters a group of young people riding scooters, playing music, and dancing. They happily form an impromptu parade around her until she begins to smile, as a single black tear falls down her face.",

    "Synopsis": "Sissi slowly adapts to life as empress of Austria, but her mother-in-law is hard to live with. Archduchess Sophie adheres to the long-established rules, protocol and etiquette, and constantly interferes not only with the emperor's government of the empire but in his family life as well. When Sissi's first child is born, the Archduchess Sophie insists on taking away the child to raise her, because she feels Sissi is too young and inexperienced to do so. Sophie also feels that Sissi's place is not in the nursery with her baby, but with her husband as the emperor travels around the empire. A scandal threatens to break out when Sissi leaves Vienna and returns to Bavaria to see her parents. She keeps the truth from her mother, but confesses to her father that she cannot live with Archduchess Sophie's constant criticism and tyranny. Franz Joseph follows her and finally convinces her to return to Vienna. This strengthens Sissi's influence with the emperor, and she supports Count Gyula Andrássy and the cause of the Hungarians for equal standing in the Empire. The film concludes with her being crowned Queen of the Hungarians in Buda.",

    "Synopsis": "Charlie Samson is a hard-working married bookkeeper in Manhattan, struggling to advance himself by attending night school to become an accountant. He has just learned his wife is pregnant with their first child, and worries whether he is ready for fatherhood. He and four co-workers throw a bachelor party for a fellow bookkeeper, Arnold Craig, who is about to get married. After watching explicit, short stag films at one member's apartment, they decide to go bar-hopping. Charlie is to be Arnold's best man. Colleagues attending the party include the older married man, Walter, who has recently been diagnosed with asthma, and Eddie, a happy-go-lucky bachelor. The night becomes a turning point for all five men. Charlie finds his loyalty to his wife tested during the evening, and he almost has an affair with a young woman he meets on the street heading to a Greenwich Village party. Charlie's young wife at home is also shocked to hear her visiting sister reveal her own husband's extra-marital affairs. Walter, in despair about his situation, wanders off during the evening. Arnold becomes drunk and ambivalent about getting married, and he breaks off the wedding. He changes his mind after he sobers up and Charlie gives him a lecture about the benefits of married life, despite Charlie's having regretted his own marriage as the story began, and having gone to the party with the serious intention of committing adultery. We last see Eddie at a bar, striking up a conversation with an older unattractive woman. In the end, Charlie decides that married life is the way to go, and that his struggle to build a home with his wife is worthwhile, and better than the empty and lonely existence of his friend Eddie, whom he used to envy.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1919, during the Russian Civil War, a small force of Red Army soldiers that survived a crushing defeat by the Whites is forced to flee into the Karakum Desert. Among them is female sniper Maria, who has already claimed thirty-eight enemies dead. When the unit ambushes a camel caravan transporting White soldiers, she kills two of them and tries to shoot their officer, who will be her forty-first, but misses. The man, a lieutenant named Govorukha-Otrok, is carrying a letter from Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak to General Anton Denikin that states he has secret information to be conveyed orally to General Dratsekno. Maria is entrusted with guarding him. Tensions arise between the two: the officer is a well-educated aristocrat who is both amused and impressed by the crude attempts of Maria, a fisherman's orphan daughter, to compose Agitprop poetry. When their camels are stolen, their commander decides to send his captive on a boat to their headquarters in Kazalinsk via the Aral Sea. The vessel capsizes in a sudden storm, and only Maria and Otrok remain alive, stranded on an isolated island. The Red soldier treats the White officer when he catches a fever and is slowly charmed by his manners, while he is overcome with gratitude and begins to call her 'Man Friday' with affection. When she demands to know what he means, he tells her the story about Robinson Crusoe. The two fall in love and seem to forget about the war. When a boat approaches their isle, they first think these are fishermen and run toward them. Otrok recognizes them as White soldiers, intends to join them, and encourages Maria to come with him, promising her she will be safe. Instead, Maria shoots him in the back, killing him.",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- Please review WP:FILMPLOT before adding material. Plot summaries should not exceed 700 words. --> Disillusioned knight Antonius Block and his cynical squire Jöns return from the Crusades to find the country ravaged by the plague. The knight encounters Death, whom he challenges to a chess match, believing he can survive as long as the game continues. thumb|left|upright=1|Death and Antonius Block choose sides for the chess game The knight and his squire pass a caravan of actors: Jof and his wife Mia, with their infant son Mikael and actor-manager Jonas Skat. Waking early, Jof has a vision of Mary leading the infant Jesus, which he relates to a smilingly disbelieving Mia. Block and Jöns visit a church where a fresco of the Danse Macabre is being painted. The squire chides the artist for colluding in the ideological fervor that led to the crusade. In the confessional, Block tells the priest he wants to perform \"one meaningful deed\" after what he now sees as a pointless life. Upon revealing to him the chess tactic that will save his life, the knight discovers that it is actually Death with whom he has been speaking. Leaving the church, Block speaks to a young woman condemned to be burned at the stake for consorting with the Devil. He believes she will tell him about life beyond death, only to find that she is insane. In a deserted village, Jöns saves a mute servant girl from being raped by Raval, a theologian who ten years earlier had persuaded the knight to join the Crusades and is now a thief. Jöns vows to destroy his face if they meet again. Jöns kisses the servant girl, who resists his advances. He then tells her to repay her debt by becoming his servant. She reluctantly agrees. The group goes into a town where the actors are performing. Skat is enticed away for a tryst by Lisa, wife of the blacksmith Plog. The stage show is interrupted by a procession of flagellants led by a preacher who harangues the townspeople. At the town's inn, Raval manipulates Plog and other customers into intimidating Jof. The bullying is broken up by Jöns, who slashes Raval's face. The knight and squire are joined by Jof's family, and the mute servant girl. Block enjoys a picnic of milk and wild strawberries that Mia has gathered and promises to remember that evening for the rest of his life. He then invites Plog and the actors to shelter from the plague in his castle. When they encounter Skat and Lisa in the forest, she returns to Plog, while Skat fakes a remorseful suicide. As the group moves on, Skat climbs a tree to spend the night, but Death appears beneath and cuts down the tree. Meeting the condemned woman being led to execution, Block asks her to summon Satan so he can question him about God. The girl claims she has done so, but the knight only sees her terror and gives her herbs to take away her pain as she is placed on the pyre. thumb|upright=1.05|The final scene depicting the Danse Macabre. They encounter Raval, stricken by the plague. Jöns stops the servant girl from uselessly bringing him water, and Raval dies alone. Jof then sees the knight playing chess with Death and decides to flee with his family, while Block knowingly keeps Death occupied. As Death states, \"No one escapes me,\" Block knocks the chess pieces over, but Death restores them to their places. On the next move, Death wins the game and announces that when they meet again, it will be the last time for all. Death then asks Block if he achieved the \"meaningful deed\" he wished to accomplish. The knight replies that he has. Block is reunited with his wife and the party shares a final supper, interrupted by Death's arrival. The other members of the party then introduce themselves, and the formerly mute servant girl greets him with \"It is finished.\" Jof and his family have sheltered in their caravan from a storm, which he interprets as the Angel of Death passing by. In the morning, Jof sees a vision of the knight and his companions being led away over the hillside in a Dance of Death.",

    "Synopsis": "Widower Ephraim Cabot, a greedy New England farmer who has overworked two wives to their graves, works his three sons from the two women as slaves. The farm's land originally belonged to the second wife, and before her death she pleads with Eben, the youngest son, to take the farm from the old man as his birthright. Eben buys out his half-brothers' shares of the farm with money stolen from his father, and Peter and Simeon head off to California to seek their fortune. Ephraim announces that his desire is for the farm not to be left to anyone, but rather burned to the ground on his death. Later, Ephraim returns with a new wife, Anna, a beautiful and headstrong woman from Italy, who enters into an adulterous affair with Eben. Soon after, Anna bears Eben's child, but lets Ephraim believe that the child is his, with the old man's assurance that the farm shall be willed to her. The proud Ephraim is oblivious to his neighbours' open mocking of him as a cuckold. Eben and Anna argue and, in a fit of jealousy because of comments from his father, Eben tells Anna he wishes the baby were dead and desires to never see Anna again. Madly in love with Eben and fearful of losing him because of the argument, Anna kills the infant, thinking this will prove to Eben her commitment to him. However, an angry and distraught Eben threatens to tell the sheriff what she has done and departs. Before the sheriff arrives Eben returns to the farm and admits to Anna the depths of his love for her and confesses his own role in the infanticide. The old man condemns them both, calls out God, and is content that the farm will not fall into anyone's hands. The sheriff comments to his deputy that he wishes he could possess such a special farm as Ephraim's and then takes the two lovers to jail.",

    "Synopsis": "M. Hulot is the dreamy, impractical, and adored uncle of nine-year-old Gérard Arpel, who lives with his materialistic parents, M. and Mme. Arpel, in an ultra-modern geometric house and garden, Villa Arpel, in a new suburb of Paris, situated just beyond the crumbling stone buildings of the old neighborhoods of the city. Gérard's parents are entrenched in a machine-like existence of work, fixed gender roles, the acquisition of status through possessions, and conspicuous displays to impress guests, such as the fish-shaped fountain at the center of the garden that, in a running gag, Mme. Arpel activates only for important visitors. thumb|right|A replica of Villa Arpel at the Cent Quatre in Paris, 2009 Each element of Villa Arpel is stylistically rather than functionally designed, creating an environment completely indifferent to the comfort, or lack of comfort, of its occupants. In choosing modern architecture to punctuate his satire, Tati once stated, \" \" (\"Geometrical lines do not produce likeable people\"). From inconveniently located stepping stones, to difficult-to-sit-on furniture, to a kitchen filled with deafeningly loud appliances, every facet of Villa Arpel emphasizes the impracticality of a dedication to superficial aesthetics and electrical gadgets over the necessities of daily living. Despite the superficial beauty of its modern design, the Arpels' home is entirely impersonal, as are the Arpels themselves. In fact, M. and Mme. Arpel have completely subordinated their individuality to maintain their social position and their shiny new possessions. Tati emphasises his themes surrounding the Arpel lifestyle (as well as M. Arpel's automatonic workplace, Plastac) with monochromatic shades and cloudy days. By contrast, Monsieur Hulot lives in an old and run-down city district. \" [Hulot prefers the poetry of wasteland, stray dogs and prankster kids.]}} He is unemployed, and gets around town either on foot or on a VéloSoleX motorised bicycle. Gérard, utterly bored by the sterility and monotony of his life with his parents, fastens himself to his uncle at every opportunity. Hulot, little more than a child himself at times, is completely at home with Gérard, but also completely ineffectual at controlling his horseplay with his school friends, who take delight in tormenting adults with practical jokes. Exasperated at their relative's perceived immaturity, the Arpels soon scheme to saddle him with the twin yokes of family and business responsibilities.",

    "Synopsis": "The morning after their blunder, the resistance fighters are attacked by a German vessel. The Norwegians' boat contains 8 tons of explosives intended to destroy the air control tower. The commandos explode their payload, and Baalsrud and some other survivors flee. They swim ashore in ice-cold Arctic waters. Baalsrud is the only one to escape the Nazi roundup. Soaking wet and missing one shoe, he escapes up a ravine, and shoots and kills a Gestapo officer. Baalsrud evades capture for roughly two months, during which time he suffers from frostbite and snow blindness. He fails in his bid to reach the border of neutral Sweden and throws himself at the mercy of some Norwegians who have access to the Norwegian underground. While hiding in their barn, he amputates most of his frostbitten toes with an ordinary knife, because gangrene has set in. The fellow Norwegians manage to move Baalsrud close to the Swedish border, but are forced to leave him in a snow cave for roughly two weeks. They make a new plan to get him over the border, having him transported by a reindeer herder, who finally gets him across the frontier to safety. Baalsrud recuperates in a Swedish hospital for seven months. He returns to England through South Africa, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and America before rejoining the fight.",

    "Synopsis": "Washington, DC, 1944. Gene Summers, a young U.S. Army Air Force ex-bombardier who speaks French fluently, is selected for a mission in Nazi-occupied Paris, where he will assassinate a supposed double agent working in the French Resistance. He travels home to Boston to visit his mother before being transferred to England for rigorous training. Summers is then dropped into France. He makes his way to Paris, where he meets his Resistance contact, Léonie, a dressmaker. She provides Summers with information about the man he is to terminate, Marcel Lafitte. However, after observing and then unexpectedly meeting Lafitte at a café, Summers experiences second thoughts about his mission. Lafitte is gentle, polite, friendly, and intelligent. He has a wife and daughter whom he obviously loves, and he also dotes on his pet cat, Mimieux, protecting her from harm at a time when cats are being killed and eaten due to food shortages. At a subsequent meeting, with curfew drawing near, Lafitte apparently saves Summers from being detained by German troops (who are hunting a Resistance assassin) by allowing him to take shelter in his office. Summers' misgivings deepen and he begins to doubt Lafitte is a double agent. Summers reveals all this to Leonie, but she rebukes him sharply, reminding him that he would not have been ordered to kill without reason. His confidence regained, Summers prepares to kill Lafitte. Returning to his office, he cracks a blunt object over the man's head, but the blow merely stuns him. The stricken Lafitte turns over to look directly into the eyes of Summers. He then utters a single word: \"Why?\" In a panic, Summers stabs Lafitte with a pair of scissors, killing him. He then steals money from Lafitte's table, attempting to make the scene look like a robbery. Narrowly escaping the Gestapo, the distraught Summers hides the money in a cemetery. He tries to contact Léonie, but it is too late. The Nazis have captured her. Racked with guilt, Summers steals off into the night. Several months later, after Paris has been liberated, Summers is recovering in a military hospital. After the assassination, he had retreated into alcoholism, using the money he stole from Lafitte to finance his habit. Summers learns that Léonie was killed by the Nazis after her capture. At first, the Army tries to convince him that Lafitte was guilty and that many lives were saved by his death. However, Summers is not convinced and insists on knowing the truth. It is finally revealed that Lafitte was, in fact, innocent. Summers leaves the hospital to visit Lafitte's wife and daughter, who are now impoverished. Unable to tell them all the facts behind Lafitte's death, Summers instead praises Lafitte as one of the Allies' best Resistance agents. He then offers them his own back pay, which they gratefully accept.",

    "Synopsis": "Paresh Chandra Dutt (Tulsi Chakrabarti), a middle-class bank clerk in Kolkata, attends a charity match on a rainy day rather reluctantly. At Curzon Park (modern-day Surendranath Park), where the match is apparently to be held, he finds a small, round stone. Thinking it is a marble, he gives it to his nephew. The child discovers that it turns metal into gold (i.e. the philosopher's stone). Dutt \"buys\" the stone from the child with sweets after witnessing the stone's power himself. He decides to take a few old cannonballs from the city dump, turn them into gold, and sell them. This scheme makes him rich; as a chauffeur drives him home from the dump, the car pulls into the driveway of a mansion (his new home). He now has a young secretary named Priyatosh Henry Biswas (Kali Banerjee) who, among other things, mentions that Dutt is invited to a cocktail party (his first). At the party, Dutt acts slightly unnatural before engaging in drunken revelry. When another guest orders him to get out, he turns an iron figurine into gold (thus partially revealing how he became successful). It is not long before this incident is posted as a headline in the papers, causing a panic in Bengal. Paresh Dutt flees with his wife, Giribala (Ranibala Devi), leaving nearly everything (including the stone) with Priyatosh but cautioning him to hand it over if the police arrive. Soon, Mr. and Mrs. Dutt are taken to a police station for interrogation, and the police discover that the desperate Priyatosh has swallowed the stone. Dr. Nandi (Moni Srimani), a medical specialist, informs the inspector (Haridhan Mukherjee) that Priyatosh is digesting the stone. Soon after Paresh and Giribala Dutt hear of this, they notice the golden objects turning back into iron. The Dutts happily rejoin their servant (Jahar Roy) and Priyatosh.",

    "Synopsis": "The story begins at La Madrileña, a boardinghouse in Buenos Aires. The owner, Mrs. Milagros, lives there with her three daughters along with Camilo Canegato, a shy, short-statured, middle-aged, painter and portrait restorer; David Réguel, a law school student; and several others. After residing at the house for 12 years, Camilo begins to receive perfumed, love letters from a woman named Rosaura with the 10pm mail. Also, he has a painting of the young and beautiful Rosaura hidden in his room. Mrs. Milagros and her daughters read the passionate letters without Camilo's knowledge and later discover the painting. They are astonished that such a young beauty could fall in love with the shy painter. They also learn of Rosaura's life with her aunt and wealthy, domineering father who is forcing her to marry a man she doesn't love. One evening, Rosaura unexpectedly arrives at the house asking for Camilo. Mrs. Milagros immediately recognizes her from the painting and enthusiastically welcomes her. Camilo, however, is shocked beyond words to see her and treats her coldly. Mrs. Milagros invites her to live in the house free of charge but David suspects something ugly between Camilo and Rosaura after getting to know her. Despite this, Rosaura stays and she and Camilo soon marry. Tragedy strikes when Rosaura is found dead in the hotel room where she and Camilo spend their first night as a married couple. David, who followed the couple in a cab, discovers Rosaura's body and races back to the house to announce that Camilo has killed her. The police investigate by questioning the boarders and by reading an unmailed letter written by Rosaura to her aunt. They discover Rosaura's name was really Maria, a young woman Camilo met several years ago who was the niece of his laundry lady. Maria's aunt gave a picture of her to Camilo and he quickly became enamored. Seeing this, Maria's aunt encouraged her to offer Camilo sex for money which he readily agreed to. The final time Camilo sought Maria for her services her aunt said she had died but in reality she had been sentenced to prison for an unspecified crime. After five years in jail, Maria appeared at the door of an old girlfriend's apartment and asked to live with her. She agreed but soon discovered her friend was part of a prostitution ring and was working for a man named the Turk. Later, two pimps who worked for the Turk tried to force Maria into prostitution. She refused and received a beating from one of them because of it. The group tried to hold her prisoner in the apartment but Maria escaped the next morning by picking the lock to the apartment's door. She then went to La Madrileña looking for Camilo, not out of love, but to ask him for money so she could travel back to her province to be with her aunt. After questioning Camilo, police discover the love letters were written by Camilo himself to impress Matilde, the adult daughter of Mrs. Milagros, for whom he had romantic feelings. Also, Camilo's photo of Maria served as the model for the painting of the fictional Rosaura. Maria's arrival at the boarding house and the love letters were mere coincidence. Camilo also says, on their wedding night Maria taunted him and reminded him that he will have to pay her alimony if he divorces her. Enraged, Camilo began to strangle her but couldn't bring himself to kill her. He then ran out of the hotel and into the street in a daze to find David waiting outside. David had followed the couple out of fear for Maria's safety. Coincidentally, the hotel that Camilo and Maria checked into was owned by the Turk, whom Maria had never met, and it was the Turk who checked them in. The police conclude the Turk and/or his pimps killed Maria. With the investigation complete, the police arrest the Turk, the pimps and Maria's friend. Camilo is then cleared of suspicion.",

    "Synopsis": "Empress Elisabeth of Austria, nicknamed Sissi, enjoys travelling in Hungary. She welcomes the politically valuable friendship of Count Andrássy, but when he confesses he is in love with her, she returns to Vienna lest the relationship become too intimate. Her time in Hungary is only a temporary relief from the frustrations of court life in Vienna, where dutiful Franz Josef remains at his desk and allows his strict, domineering mother Sophie to interfere in the raising of his daughter with Sissi, Sophie. Sissi decides to return and meets Franz underway who was coming to Hungary to bring her back to Vienna. They decide to take a vacation in Bad Ischl but Sissi falls ill and is diagnosed with possibly fatal tuberculosis. On doctors' orders Franz Josef must allow his mother to remove his daughter from Sissi's keeping. In poor health, deprived of the company of husband and child, Sissi is in danger of losing the will to live as she travels to healthier climates on Madeira and Corfu. Desperately needed psychosomatic therapy appears in the form of her indestructibly positive mother Ludovika, who lovingly nurses Sissi's illness and restores her zest for life by taking her on idyllic walks. Once again Oberst Böckl, the clumsy body-guard whose doting admiration for the empress borders on the improper, provides a comical note, as he does in each part of the trilogy. Finally, Sissi recovers and rejoins her husband on an official visit to Milan and Venice, Austria's remaining possessions in northern Italy. Italian nationalists have prepared a hostile welcome for the Habsburg sovereigns; the Milanese nobility send their servants, dressed in noble clothing, to a royal command performance at La Scala, at which the orchestra begins with the melody of Joseph Haydn's \"Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser\" but smoothly transitions to Verdi's chorus \"Va, pensiero\" from Nabucco and the disguised servants in the audience sing it in protest against Austrian rule. There is a moment of comic relief when, after the opera, Franz Josef and Sissi receive the disguised servants at a formal reception, where the servants are presented to the imperial couple under the names of their aristocratic masters and mistresses. Sissi is aware that she is not meeting the true nobility, but when the real nobles realize their servants were introduced to the emperor and empress, they shriek in despair and panic at the idea that the imperial couple believe the awkward, common servants were really the aristocrats. In Venice, crowds stand in hostile silence at the couple's procession by royal barge on the Grand Canal and as they pass, Italian nationalist flags are defiantly unfurled from behind shuttered windows. But the emotional Italians melt when they witness the openly loving reunion between Sissi and her little daughter on St Mark's Square.",

    "film_title": "The Brothers Karamazov (1958 film)",
    "Synopsis": "In 1870 Russia, Fyodor Karamazov, a dissipated and unscrupulous businessman, manipulates three legitimate sons, Dmitri, an army officer; Ivan, a writer; and Alexey, a monk; as well as a bastard son, Pavel Smerdyakov, who lives like a servant in Fyodor’s home. Impractical with money, Dmitri spends on drinking, partying, and women whatever money he can wrest from his father from an inheritance his mother left him. Before giving Dimitri any money, Fyodor forces him to sign a promissory note. Alexey delivers to Dimitri a portion of the amount he has requested from Fyodor, and Dimitri proceeds to drink and wreck a tavern in a brawl. Besides financial irresponsibility, Dimitri has an idiosyncratic sense of gallantry. The desperate daughter of a military commander, Katya Ivanova, has agreed to exchange sexual favors for five thousand rubles to replace the amount stolen from her father’s charge. When Katya presents herself to fulfill the bargain, Dimitri sardonically proposes marriage, but Katya declines, saying that would be a greater degradation. Dmitri gives Katya the money without holding her to any bargain and sends her away. After Dmitri is arrested for the tavern brawl, Katya visits him in gratitude in a military prison. When Dimitri asserts he always intended to give her the money, Katya declares her admiration to him and takes charge. Her grandmother has given her a generous dowry, and Katya now accepts his earlier half-serious proposal. Unenthusiastically, Dmitry agrees to their betrothal. Katya then intends to settle his debts with Fyodor, but Dmitri refuses. She bails Dmitri out of prison. When Katya asks Ivan for details of Dmitri's youth, Ivan becomes attracted to her. Fyodor presses Dmitri to pay off his notes, and Dmitri leaves town for several months. During Dmitri’s absence, Ivan visits Katya daily, while Fyodor targets young, beautiful, shrewd tavern owner Grushenka Svetlova. Fyodor and Grushenka plot to cheat Dmitri of his inheritance. To gain Grushenka’s regard, Fyodor has given her Dmitri's notes to collect for herself. Grushenka refuses Fyodor’s advances, but has former army captain Snegiryov, an employee, buy all Dmitri's debts at fraction value and demand repayment. Unable to pay, Dmitry will go to debtor's prison, and Fyodor can keep Dmitri's inheritance legally. Dmitri confronts Snegiryov in the street, humiliating the meek man in front of his young son Illusha. Katya again offers to pay Dmitri’s debts, but Dmitri refuses. She then asks him to mail a letter containing three thousand rubles to her father, knowing that Dimitri will keep the money. Dmitri confronts Grushenka, but the two are strongly attracted and spend Katya's money on a binge. Grushenka forgives Dmitri his debts when he determines not to marry Katya. Dmitri asks Alexey to speak to Katya to break their engagement. Dmitri and Grushenka start a passionate affair, but Dmitri’s obsession increasingly turns into corrosive, possessive jealousy. Smerdyakov greatly admires Ivan, the intellectual, and in conversation both agree that if God does not exist, all behavior is permissible. Dmitri bursts in, looking for Grushenka, who he suspects is seeing his father. When Fyodor taunts him, Dmitri attacks his father, threatening to kill him if he sees Grushenka. Alexey goes to Katya on his errand from Dmitri. He finds Grushenka with Katya, who assures Alexey that Grushenka is tired of Dmitri's jealousy and wants to return to a Polish officer. Angered by Katya's presumptuousness, Grushenka insists she has not promised to leave Dmitri and departs. Ivan arrives to inform Katya he is going to Moscow. When Katya urges him to stay, Ivan derides her for using him while besotted with an indifferent Dmitri. Pawning his pistols, Dmitry asks Alexey to give the money to Snegiryov as an apology for his insult. Dmitri realizes he must take responsibility for his actions. While Dmitri collects debts owed him by army colleagues, Alexey takes the money to Snegiryov. Shamed by the insult, Illusha convinces his father not to accept the apology or the money. Smerdyakov brags to Ivan that he is planning to arrange a confrontation between Fyodor and Dmitri and believes Dmitri will kill his father. After Ivan goes to Moscow, Smerdyakov puts his plot into action, arranging a rendezvous between Grushenka and the Polish officer. When Dmitri finds Grushenka gone, he goes to Fyodor's, but Dmitri is unable to assault his father, even when Fyodor attacks him. Confronting Grushenka and the Polish officer, Dmitri finds that the officer has been gambling all evening, and a neglected Grushenka realizes that he only wants her for her money. Grushenka apologizes to Dmitri and reconciles with him. The police arrive and Dmitri is stunned to learn that Fyodor has been murdered. At his trial, Dmitri pleads guilty to a life of debauchery and debt but innocent of murdering Fyodor. The prosecutor discloses that three thousand rubles were stolen from Fyodor the night of his murder. Katya testifies that Dmitri had taken the same amount from her but insists she did not want reimbursement. Afterward, Ivan tells Katya that he expects Dmitri will be found guilty, but he has a plan to smuggle Dmitri out of Russia. At home, Ivan confronts Smerdyakov, wearing Fyodor's clothes and drinking his liquor. Smerdyakov confesses to killing Fyodor and stealing three thousand rubles to implicate Dmitri but insists that Ivan was complicit when he took off knowing Smerdyakov’s plot. Ivan departs for the police. Later that evening, Alexey and Grushenka find Smerdyakov has hanged himself. At trial, Ivan testifies to Smerdyakov's confession and his own implication. A vindictive Katya produces a letter from Dmitri claiming he will repay her money even if he has to kill Fyodor to get it. Dmitri is found guilty. The next day, Katya watches the train transporting prisoners to prison camp, disappointed that Dmitri is not among them. Ivan and Alexey have arranged to get Dmitri and Grushenka out of Russia. As a last stop on their escape route, despite the obvious risks of wasting time, Dmitri visits the Snegiryov family, where Illusha lies in bed with a grave illness. First, Dmitri tries to buy the pardon of the boy with small gifts but the boy refuses and turns away. Then Dmitri pretends it was just a duel that happened between the former captain and himself, and he was afraid for his own life, knowing the marksmanship of the former captain, and asks for forgiveness. The boy finally turns to his father and asks him to spare Dmitri's life and release him from his bond. After this reconciliation, Dmitri and Grushenka resume their escape.",

    "Synopsis": "In Moscow, on June 22, 1941, Veronika and her boyfriend Boris watch cranes fly over the city as the sun rises and then sneak back into their families' apartments. Hours later, Boris’s cousin Mark wakes him with the news that the Germans have invaded. Veronika soon learns that Boris has volunteered for the army. Boris asks his grandmother to give Veronika her birthday gift, a stuffed squirrel toy (\"squirrel\" is Boris's pet name for Veronika), into which he slides a love note. Veronika arrives too late to see Boris at his apartment, but his grandmother gives Veronika the stuffed squirrel. Veronika searches for Boris at the assembly station for those being drafted into the army, but he has already marched off to war by then. Veronika remains in Moscow with her parents, who are killed in a German air raid that also destroys their apartment building. Boris's family invites the orphaned Veronika to stay with them. Boris's cousin Mark tells Veronika he loves her, but she faithfully waits for Boris to return. Veronika and Mark are alone in the apartment when another air raid occurs. Mark makes a pass at her, but she rebuffs him. Furious at being rejected, he rapes her. Veronika and Mark marry, but she despises him, and in turn, she is despised by the family who considers her to have betrayed Boris. At the front, Boris gets into an argument with another soldier, Volodya, who taunts him over a photo of Veronika. Their commanding officer catches them fighting and assigns them a dangerous reconnaissance mission. Boris saves Volodya’s life, but gets shot himself. In his final moments, he has a vision of the wedding that he and Veronika would never have. To escape the German offensive, the family is relocated to Siberia. Veronika works as a nurse in a military hospital run by Boris's father, Fyodor. Mark and Veronika are miserable in their marriage. When a soldier in the hospital becomes hysterical after receiving a letter saying his girlfriend left him for someone else, Veronika rushes to get Fyodor, who is processing the arrival of wounded troops. She barely misses seeing the injured Volodya, who is about to be admitted to the hospital, before Fyodor says that the hospital is full. Fyodor admonishes the distraught soldier to forget his unfaithful and unworthy girlfriend. Veronika overhears Fyodor’s speech and becomes upset since she appears to be such a woman. Overwhelmed with guilt, Veronika tries to throw herself in front of a train. Just before she attempts suicide, she sees a young child about to be hit by a car and rescues him. The boy has been separated from his mother, and his name is Boris. Veronika takes the boy home and looks for her squirrel toy from Boris. Boris's sister Irina spitefully tells Veronika that Mark is giving the toy to his mistress at her birthday party. Veronika races over to the party, where a partygoer has finally found the note that Boris hid. Veronika grabs it, and in voice-over, Boris narrates the final tender love note to her. Fyodor learns that Mark bribed his way out of being drafted into the Red Army. He realises Mark betrayed Russia and the family and has taken advantage of Veronika. Fyodor kicks Mark out, and Veronika is forgiven by the family for \"betraying\" Boris. The boy saved by Veronika becomes part of the family. Later, Volodya, having recovered, comes in search of Boris's family and tells them that Boris is dead. In 1945, the war has ended, and Veronika and Volodya stroll by the river back in Moscow. They are very close, but Veronika still refuses to believe that Boris is dead since Volodya was injured himself and never saw Boris die. When Boris’s unit returns, Veronika carries a huge bouquet of flowers, intends to give them to him, and hunts for him and his friend Stepan during a celebration at the train station. Veronika finds Stepan and finally learns that Boris is indeed dead. In tears, she stumbles through the celebrating crowd. As Stepan gives a rousing speech, asserting that those who died in the war will never be forgotten, Veronika goes from grieving to handing out her flowers to the returning soldiers and their families. When she looks up, cranes are flying again in the sky over Moscow.",

    "Synopsis": "thumb|left|Ben Quick talks to Clara Varner. On the left is Agnes. Ben Quick is on trial for barn-burning, but since there is no evidence the judge just orders him to leave town. Ben hitches a ride to Frenchman's Bend, Mississippi, with two young women in a convertible, Clara Varner and her sister-in-law Eula. Clara's father, Will Varner, is the domineering owner of most of the town. Will is away, but his only son, Eula's husband Jody, agrees to let Ben become a sharecropper on a vacant farm. When Will returns from a stay in the hospital, he is furious at Jody for hiring a notorious \"barn burner\", but soon begins to see in Ben a younger version of himself and comes to admire his ruthlessness and ambition, qualities that Jody lacks. Will is also disappointed that his 23-year-old daughter, Clara, has not married the man she has been seeing for five or six years: Alan Stewart, a genteel Southern \"blue blood\" and a mama's boy. Will therefore schemes to push his daughter and Ben together. However, she is openly hostile to the crude upstart. Will is determined to have his bloodline go on, so he offers to make Ben wealthy if he marries Clara. Meanwhile, Minnie Littlejohn, Will's longtime mistress, is dissatisfied with their arrangement and wants to get married. thumb|upright|Eula and Jody Jody becomes increasingly frustrated, seeing his position being undermined, and his marriage falters. After Ben sells some worthless wild horses for Will, he is rewarded with the job of clerk in Will's general store alongside Jody. Will even invites him to live in the family mansion. Jody pulls a gun on Ben and threatens to kill him. Ben talks his way out by telling Jody about buried Civil War-era coins he has supposedly found on a property that Will gave him, a down payment to seal their bargain over Clara. Jody starts digging and finds a bag of coins. He is elated, thinking he has finally escaped his father's domination; he buys the land from Ben. Late that night, Will finds his son, still digging. After examining a coin, Will notices that it was minted in 1910. Jody is shattered. Ben aggressively pursues Clara. She finally asks Alan what his intentions are, and he replies that he only wants to \"help\" her. Misinterpreting what Clara tells him, Will goes to congratulate Alan and his mother on the impending marriage, but is infuriated when he learns the truth. He returns home. A defeated Jody finds his father alone in their barn. Jody bolts the entrance and sets the barn on fire, but he cannot go through with it and releases Will. Will is touched by Jody's change of heart and calls him his \"strong right arm.\" Men from town assume Ben is the culprit and intend to lynch him, but Clara rescues him from the mob and drives him back to the plantation. Will defuses the situation by telling the mob he accidentally started the fire himself. Ben confesses to Clara that his father was a barn-burner, committing arson when offended, and that he has been falsely dogged by such accusations because of his father. Ben tells her he is leaving town, but Clara makes it clear she has fallen in love with him. Will is so pleased with the success of his scheme, he declares he may decide to live forever.",

    "film_title": "The Spessart Inn",
    "Synopsis": "In the late years of the 18th century, Felix and Peter, two journeymen, are travelling across the Spessart hills to Würzburg. Scared of the bandits that plague these parts, especially after a brief encounter with them, the two are glad to find an inn in the middle of the forest. However, it turns out that they have wandered into a den of thieves. The owners are in league with the bandits, who this very night plan to abduct Franziska, the Comtesse von Sandau, who is travelling through the forest with a group including her fiancé, Baron Sperling. Their coach is waylaid by a trap and the bandits direct them to the nearby inn. The waitress warns the journeymen of impending danger and they pass on the warning to the nobles. During the night, the brigands arrive. To escape, the Comtesse switches places with Felix and, in a man's clothes, escapes with Peter. Felix (as Comtesse), Franziska's maid and the pastor are taken to the bandits' lair. The bandits send Baron Sperling on his way to convey their ransom demand for 20,000 guilders to Graf Sandau, Franziska's father. When Franziska arrives at her father's castle, he refuses to pay the ransom for the commoner who has taken his daughter's place. Instead, Graf Sandau decides to send the military against the bandits. Franziska thus rides to the bandits' lair and pretends to be a highwayman herself. The bandit leader accepts her as a henchman, but makes her sleep in his hut. In the morning he discovers her true identity but keeps this information from his men. When Graf Sandau finds out that the Comtesse has gone to the bandits he sends Baron Sperling to the inn with the ransom money. The soldiers shadow him but the plan to follow the bandits back to their lair fails. Meanwhile, at the bandits' lair, their corporal finds out that the \"Comtesse\" they have imprisoned is a man. Franziska, on the pretense that she wants to find out the truth about the prisoner, switches back places with Felix, which saves his life but makes her a prisoner. The corporal wants to kill her and a confrontation ensues. The leader sides with the prisoners and during the fight, the parson escapes. The soldiers find the bandits' lair, but the leader snatches the Comtesse and rides off. Franziska conceals the bandit leader in her father's castle. He reveals to her that he is in fact the son of an Italian Count from whom Graf Sandau borrowed money in the past, which he never repaid. After his father's death he came to Germany to recover his money from Graf Sandau, but before he could do so he was taken prisoner by the bandits. They forced him to join their band and eventually he became their leader. The planned abduction of the Comtesse was intended to make Graf Sandau finally pay the money he owed. The soldiers search the castle and the bandit leader flees. However, he returns and elopes with Franziska who was about to marry Baron Sperling—a purely financial match set up by her father. The bandit leader/count takes Franziska in lieu of the money he is owed and they drive off in a wagon.",

Curious and apprehensive, Tanya visits Natalia in her village, discovering a world vastly different from her own. Initially feeling out of place, Tanya gradually begins to understand and connect with the people and the rural way of life. Natalia introduces Tanya to Nyura, a local farm worker, and Sergey Ivanovich, a former soldier and the village chairman. Tanya witnesses village life firsthand, including the challenges faced by its residents. When Nyura is accused of theft, Sergey Ivanovich intervenes to ensure justice, reinforcing Tanya’s admiration for his fairness and leadership. As Tanya prepares to return to Moscow, she unexpectedly finds herself helping Nyura, who plans to leave the village. Tanya convinces her friend to stay, highlighting the strong bond they have developed. Meanwhile, Tanya’s growing affection for Sergey Ivanovich leads to an emotional conversation where he gently explains that their connection is not meant to be. Tanya hides her disappointment, but her feelings are noticed by Natalia and her grandfather. In a parallel story, Sergey Ivanovich rekindles his love for Stepanida, a woman marked by personal losses and societal changes after the war. Their union brings closure to both characters, while Tanya gracefully accepts Stepanida’s happiness, despite her own heartache. By the film’s end, Tanya decides to stay in the village and embrace her roots, forming a deeper bond with Natalia. She writes to her adoptive mother, expressing her excitement to introduce her biological mother. Tanya envisions her future as a teacher, inspired by the village and its people.

    "Synopsis": "The film is set during the Bulgarian-Serbian War of 1885. A group of Bulgarian cavalrymen, led by the daring Lieutenant Sergius, attacks a Serbian cannon commanded by the Swiss captain Bluntschli. This seemingly suicidal attack unexpectedly ends in a Bulgarian victory because the cannon is supplied with the wrong ammunition and cannot be fired. Captain Bluntschli, forced to flee on foot, seeks refuge in the house of the Bulgarian Petkoff family, whose daughter Raina is engaged to his adversary Sergius. Raina, initially idealistic about Sergius's \"great victory,\" becomes disillusioned after sheltering Bluntschli, realizing the harsh realities of war. Despite sympathizing with the \"enemy,\" Raina hides Bluntschli from Bulgarian soldiers and later allows him to stay in their house. After the war, Sergius is celebrated as a hero by the Petkoff family, especially by Raina and her mother. Raina's father, Major Petkoff, however, prefers civilian life and is indifferent to Sergius's military bravado. Meanwhile, Sergius seeks closeness with Raina, who resists exchanging her admiration for him with physical intimacy, frustrating him. The maid Louka, aspiring for social advancement, seduces Sergius, adding to the tension. Bluntschli reappears, warmly welcomed by Major Petkoff, who admires his organizational skills and asks him to handle calculations for supplying the returning Bulgarian troops. Bluntschli takes the opportunity to return the house jacket and stay close to Raina, whose feelings for him become evident. Despite Sergius's infidelity and jealousy, Bluntschli wins a duel against him, revealing his skill in fencing. Sergius, now free to pursue Louka, shows little regret over losing Raina. Shortly after, Bluntschli discovers he has inherited several luxury hotels in Switzerland, becoming extremely wealthy. Raina's parents approve of him as an ideal husband for their daughter, who eagerly accepts the proposal.",

    "Synopsis": "A marble Greek bas-relief explodes, revealing Afro-Brazilian men dancing the samba to drums in a favela. Eurydice arrives in Rio de Janeiro and takes a trolley driven by Orfeu. New to the city, she rides to the end of the line, where Orfeu introduces her to the station guard, Hermes, who gives her directions to the home of her cousin Serafina. Although engaged to Mira, Orfeu is not very enthusiastic about their upcoming marriage. The couple goes to get a marriage license. When the clerk at the courthouse hears Orfeu's name, he jokingly asks if Mira is Eurydice, annoying her. Afterward, Mira insists on getting an engagement ring. Though Orfeu has just been paid, he would rather use his money to get his guitar out of the pawn shop for Carnival. Mira finally offers to loan Orfeu the money to buy her ring. When Orfeu goes home, he is pleased to find Eurydice staying next door with Serafina. Eurydice has run away to Rio to hide from a strange man whom she believes wants to kill her. The man – Death dressed in a stylized skeleton costume – finds her, but Orfeu gallantly chases him away. Orfeu and Eurydice fall in love, yet are constantly on the run from both Mira and Death. When Serafina's sailor boyfriend Chico shows up, Orfeu offers to let Eurydice sleep in his home, while he takes the hammock outside. Eurydice invites him to her bed, and they make love. Orfeu, Mira, and Serafina are the principal members of a samba school, one of many parading during Carnival. Serafina decides to have Eurydice dress in her Queen of the Night costume so that she can spend more time with Chico. A veil conceals Eurydice's face; only Orfeu is told of the deception. During the parade, Orfeu dances with Eurydice rather than Mira. Eventually, Mira spots Serafina among the spectators and rips off Eurydice's veil. Eurydice is forced once again to run for her life, first from Mira and then from Death. Trapped in Orfeu's own trolley station, she hangs from a power line to get away from Death and is accidentally killed by Orfeu when he turns the power on and electrocutes her. Death tells Orfeu, \"Now she's mine,\" before knocking him out. Distraught, Orfeu looks for Eurydice at the Office of Missing Persons, although Hermes has told him she is dead. The building is deserted at night, with only a janitor sweeping up. He tells Orfeu that the place holds only papers and that no people can be found there. Taking pity on Orfeu, the janitor takes him down a large darkened spiral staircase – a reference to the mythical Orpheus' descent into the underworld – to a Macumba ritual, a regional form of the Afro-Brazilian religion Candomblé. At the gate, they pass a guard dog named Cerberus. During the ritual, the janitor tells Orfeu to call to his beloved by singing. The spirit of Eurydice inhabits the body of an old woman and speaks to him. Orfeu wants to gaze upon her, but Eurydice begs him not to, lest he lose her forever. When he turns and looks anyway, he sees the old woman, and Eurydice's spirit departs, as in the Greek myth. Orfeu wanders in mourning. He retrieves Eurydice's body from the city morgue and carries her in his arms across town and up the hill toward his home, where his shack is burning. A vengeful Mira flings a stone that hits him in the head and knocks him over a cliff to his death, with Eurydice still in his arms. Two children, Benedito and Zeca – who have followed Orfeu throughout the film – believe Orfeu's tale that his guitar playing causes the sun to rise every morning. After Orfeu's death, Benedito insists that Zeca pick up the guitar and play so that the sun will rise. Zeca plays, and the sun comes up. A little girl appears, gives Zeca a single flower, and the three children dance.",

    "Synopsis": "Close friends Judd Steiner and Artie Straus each believe they fit Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy of a \"superman\" (Übermensch), and thus are above the law. From wealthy, socially prominent families, both are graduate law students under age twenty at the University of Chicago (Artie tells investigators that he began undergraduate studies at the University of Michigan at age 14). Both believe themselves able to outsmart the \"inferior\" persons surrounding them. Challenging Professor McKinnon's classroom lecture on \"tribal codes,\" Judd asserts that Nietzsche claimed tribal leaders did not feel compelled to obey the laws they set: <blockquote> McKinnon (in disagreement): \"Did Moses consider himself above the laws that he laid?\" Judd: \"He had a motley crew on his hands, and he had to get them through the desert somehow.\" </blockquote> Sid Brooks, a classmate earning his way through college working at a newspaper, expresses wonder at Judd's interactions with the esteemed professor: <blockquote> Sid: \"Every time I stick my neck out, he chops my head off. You get away with murder. How come?\" Judd: \"I don't know, he just doesn't seem to think very fast.\" Sid: \"He's supposed to be one of the brightest men in the faculty.\" Judd: \"I suppose he is.\" </blockquote> thumb|upright=0.7| Bradford Dillman plays Artie Straus, the dominant of the two friends who believe they fit Nietzsche's philosophy of a \"superman\" (Übermensch), thus are above the law. thumb|upright=0.7| Dean Stockwell plays Judd Steiner, the submissive personality who goes along with Artie's increasingly criminal commands. thumb|upright=0.7| Martin Milner plays Sid Brooks, a classmate of Steiner and Straus's, a reporter who discovers the eyeglasses found near Paulie's body, assumed to be his, are too large to be Paulie's and are key evidence. thumb|upright=0.7| Diane Varsi plays Ruth Evans, Sid Brooks's girlfriend who feels sympathy for Judd Steiner despite his having almost assaulted her. thumb|upright=0.7| E.G.

To please Artie, to whom Judd is submissive, Judd goes along with Artie's increasingly criminal commands, such as stealing $67 and a typewriter from a campus fraternity house. When Artie commands Judd to run over a hitchhiking drunk they have run off the road with his car, Judd loses resolve and narrowly misses the drunk. Artie berates Judd for his lack of conviction, which proves he is not superior. To restore himself in Artie's regard, Judd proposes to demonstrate their \"superior intellect\" by killing a boy, demanding a ransom, and outwitting the police. Cruising in their car for a victim, they lure Paulie Kessler, a neighbor on his way home from school, and kill him. Artie believes they have committed the \"perfect crime.\" When police question Paulie's neighbors, a cocky Artie \"helpfully\" engages with the investigators, spitefully giving them false leads. Asked about suspicious characters around the neighborhood; among others, Artie suggests a teacher at Paulie's school, which Judd and he had attended four years previously, who always told the kids they were spoiled brats who had too much money. When assigned a beat about a drowned boy that was found in the park, Sid discovers the eyeglasses found near Paulie's body, assumed to be his, are too large to be Paulie's and are key evidence. The glasses have a distinctive hinge, with only three pairs purchased in the Chicago area, Judd having purchased one pair. Judd, whose glasses dropped out of his pocket at the scene of the crime, is unable to produce his. Questioned, Judd claims he dropped them a few days earlier when bird-watching with his group of ornithology students. It now becomes urgent to dump the typewriter stolen from the fraternity house that they used to type the ransom note sent to the Kesslers. Needing to give each other alibis, Judd and Artie claim to have been out the evening of the murder with girls they picked up named May and Edna, whose full names they never learned. The alibi falls apart when the Steiner chauffeur unintentionally reveals he was working on repairs to Judd's car the entire evening that Judd and Artie claimed to be cruising in it with the girls (they had rented a car that could not be traced to them for the crime, but their alibi involved riding around in Judd's car). Eventually, the \"superior\" Artie cracks under interrogation and implicates Judd, who then confirms the details of Artie's confession, but insists that Artie committed the actual murder. Famed attorney Jonathan Wilk takes their case, saving them from hanging by making an impassioned closing argument against capital punishment. Steiner and Straus are given life sentences, instead.",

    "film_title": "Hiroshima mon amour",
    "Synopsis": "A series of closeups of the backs and arms of a man and woman embracing, amidst falling ash and then covered in sweat. In voiceover, the woman recounts the aftermath of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima that she has seen on her trip to the city, while newsreel and fictional footage of victims, protests, war memorials, and the streets and buildings of modern Hiroshima are shown. The man calmly says the woman has not seen anything, nor does she know what it is to forget. He is from Hiroshima and his family died in the bombing while he was off fighting in the war, and the woman is a French actress who is in the city to make an anti-war film. In the morning, the woman watches the man sleep. His twitching hand reminds her of her first love, a soldier whose hand moved similarly as he lay dying. The Japanese man wakes, and it becomes clear he and the woman met the previous night at a café. She learns he is an architect who is involved in politics. They discuss the bombing and the end of the war, and he is enchanted by the word \"Nevers\", her hometown, to which she never wants to return. The man says he would like to see the woman again, but she says she is flying back to Paris the next day. Neither this nor the revelation that she has children change how he feels, but she, though torn, repeatedly declines to arrange another meeting. The man visits the woman at the filming location, and she is happy to see him. He takes her back to his house. She asks if he lives alone, and he replies that his wife is out of town for a few days. They both say they are happy in their marriages, though they have had casual affairs before, and make love again. After deciding to spend the woman's remaining time in Hiroshima together, they go to a tea room, where the man asks the woman to tell him more about Nevers and her life there. Intercut with flashbacks, she tells how she and an occupying German soldier fell in love and planned to elope to Bavaria before he was shot while waiting for her on the day Nevers was liberated, how she stayed with him while he died over the next two days, how the villagers shaved her head when they found out about the relationship, and how her parents locked her alternately in her room and the cellar while her hair grew out and she came out of her madness and then sent her away to Paris just before Hiroshima was bombed. She tries to convey the pain she feels about forgetting the German and their love, and indicates she has been trying to keep her distance from the Japanese man because she does not want any more such heartbreak. The man is elated when he learns the woman never told her husband about the German, but when they leave the tea room, she tells him to go away and that they will probably never see each other again. In her hotel room, she feels guilty about telling the man about the German, but decides to stay in Hiroshima. She goes back to the now-closed tea room, and the man finds her and asks her to stay. She weakly says she will, but then tells him again to go away. They walk around the city, together and separately, images of Hiroshima alternating with images of Nevers. The woman goes to a train station, where she lets go of some of her issues surrounding her first love and decides she might like to visit Nevers. She takes a cab to a nightclub, the man following. The place is nearly empty and they sit apart. As the sun rises, a Japanese man sits by the woman and hits on her in English. Back in the woman's hotel room, the architect knocks at the door. She lets him in and yells that she is already starting to forget him, but abruptly calms and says his name is \"Hiroshima\". He responds that it is, and her name is \"Nevers\".",

    "film_title": "Honeymoon (1959 film)",
    "Synopsis": "Ballet dancer Anna Cato (Ludmilla Tchérina) has just given up the ballet to marry Australian farmer Kit Kelly (Anthony Steel). They are touring Spain in their open top Bentley for their honeymoon before going to live on the sheep station that Kit runs in Australia. An American car races past them at high speed but it soon has to stop to change a burst tyre. The car is driven by the famous Spanish dancer Antonio and his wife Rosita Candelas (Rosita Sergova). They are a fiery couple, always arguing and when Antonio goes down to a stream to wash up after changing the tyre, Rosita drives away without him. Antonio, stranded in the middle of nowhere, starts dancing down the road in his well-known Zapateado. Kit and Anna drive by and offer Antonio a lift. They drive in to the \"Tavern del Toro\", where Antonio is known, and start to eat a wonderful breakfast. Antonio thinks he has seen Anna before but she says that this is her first trip to Spain. One old lady pushes forward her daughter who she wants to dance for Antonio. Lucia (Carmen Rojas) dances the El Macarona flamenco but then Antonio asks the musicians to play El Taranto to really see what she can do. Rosita turns up at the end of the flamenco and another argument ensues, so Kit and Anna slip away. After a delightful meal they retire to their room where Anna does her best to distract Kit from his book on Fertility and Animal Breeding. Next day, after a bit more travelling around, Kit and Anna enter a bar – only to find Antonio is already there. They are introduced to the \"cocktail set\" and discover who Antonio is. Anna goes to Antonio's studio where they are rehearsing his new dance, Los amantes de Teruel (The Lovers of Teruel), as a classical ballet but with a Spanish style. When Anna makes some suggestions to help the pas de deux Antonio realises she is a dancer and at last discovers who she really is. As Anna dances with Antonio neither are aware that Kit has come to the studio and is watching, not very pleased that his wife is dancing again. Kit and Anna travel south to see the painting \"The Burial of the Count of Orgaz\" by El Greco. Kit declares that that is how Antonio's ballet should be staged. They then visit the Mosque at Córdoba and other places. Early the next morning Kit goes off to help a breeder of bulls with his round-up and Anna is taken to the Alhambra at Granada by Antonio. They dance around the palace in a light hearted flirtation and Anna declares that she really has given up the ballet and is willing to settle down with Kit. Antonio isn't so sure. When they go to join Kit there is a mild confrontation between Kit and Antonio. The film is building up to the two men representing Don Diego and Don Pedro, competing for the attentions of Doña Isabel in the story of Les amantes de Teruel which will be the finalé of the film. Kit and Anna go to see a performance of El Amor Brujo (Bewitched Love). The story is that of a girl whose lover had died but who now haunts her and prevents her from getting on with her life and her new lover. The lead roles are danced by Antonio and Rosita, with a cameo from Léonide Massine as the ghost – Massine was over sixty years old at the time – and Lucia as the girl's friend who tries to lure the ghost away. The restored version contains the full ballet, a mixture of classical ballet and flamenco style. The next night, in Teruel, the guide (the voice of Michael Powell) explains the legend of the lovers of Teruel to Kit and Anna as they stand on the terrace looking at the statues. But Anna falls ill and develops a fever. In her fevered imagination she hallucinates the story of the Lovers of Teruel as a great ballet, with herself dancing the part of Doña Isabel and Antonio as Don Diego, her lover. Again a mix of classical ballet and Spanish style, with Antonio in Moorish make-up. The restoration contains the full ballet to the music of Manuel de Falla. The final funeral has the echoes of the El Greco painting the couple saw earlier. The next morning Antonio comes to visit Anna, now in hospital with Kit by her side. We learn that Anna and Kit will be off to Australia in a few days and Kit thinks that at last they have seen the last of Antonio. But no, he tells them he is starting a world tour!",

    "Synopsis": "Emotionally distraught, Betty Preisser, a 24-year-old receptionist for a New York City clothing manufacturer, leaves work early, taking some typing to finish at home. Her boss, Jerry Kingsley, a widower of 56 who lives with his spinster older sister Evelyn, needs the document she took, so he drops by the apartment Betty shares with her mother and younger sister to pick it up. Although they are professional, rather than personal, acquaintances, Betty ends up telling Jerry all about her loveless marriage to her musician ex-husband, George, who called her the previous night to say he wants to get back together. Jerry, who has a married daughter, Lillian, about Betty's age, listens attentively to Betty's story and gives her some fatherly advice, which, her own father having walked out on her family when she was young, helps cheer her up. After this encounter, Jerry begins to feel other-than-fatherly feelings for Betty, and he eventually works up the nerve to invite her to dinner. Though Betty tries to end the relationship several times, saying she does not want to hurt Jerry, Jerry is always able to talk her through these periods, and they continue to see each other. As they get more serious about each other, both Jerry and Betty are nervous about how their friends and relations will respond to their May–December romance, and, as they feared, the females in their lives, in particular, disapprove of the relationship. Betty's mother calls Jerry a \"dirty old man\" the first time they meet, Betty's friend Marilyn tries to convince Betty to get back together with George, Evelyn calls Betty a \"fortune hunter\" and Jerry a fool, and, when Lillian's husband Jack offers Jerry his congratulations, Lillian tells him to mind his own business. However, Jerry's business partner Walter Lockman, who is trapped in a long and unhappy marriage and spends his time chasing after young \"tootsies\", urges Jerry pursue any chance at happiness. One night, Betty comes home after arguing with Jerry about his growing jealousy to find George waiting for her. Her mother and sister excuse themselves, and George tries to persuade Betty to return to him. In a moment of weakness, Betty gives in, and they have a romantic tryst, but she regrets it and tells Jerry what happened the next day, explaining that it meant nothing to her emotionally. Jerry feels humiliated and hurt, however, and says he no longer wants to see Betty. Evelyn observes how depressed Jerry is when he returns home and tries to talk with him, but he says he does not want her to see him in the state he is in. The phone rings, and Walter's wife tells Jerry that Walter just called her from a hotel, saying he is going to kill himself. Dealing with this crisis makes Jerry's feelings clear to himself, and he decides to take Walter's advice and pursue what makes him feel alive. Jerry goes to Betty and tells her that he loves her, and they embrace.",

    "Synopsis": "Padre Nazario, a priest living in a hostel, is quiet, temperate and distributes his money, even indifferent to being burgled. He shows understanding and compassion to such as Beatriz, who has psychotic episodes and suicidal thoughts after being abandoned by her lover, Pinto. A prostitute, Andara, runs into Nazario's room seeking shelter; she has murdered another prostitute and been wounded. Nazario withholds judgement and helps to conceal her. He tries to make her conscious of her sin. Andara hallucinates that a portrait of Jesus Christ is laughing at her. Beatriz warns them that someone has informed the authorities. Meanwhile, the hostel proprietress finds out and insists Andara must not be discovered with Nazario, ordering her to remove evidence of her stay. After Nazario has left, Andara sets the room ablaze and escapes. With Nazario afoul of the law and church, he is warned an investigation could cost him his priesthood. Having no possessions – all stolen or given away – he adopts plain clothes and wanders the country, begging. Meeting a construction crew, Nazario offers to work for food, but other workers resent him undercutting them. They shun him, so Nazario leaves with nothing. His motives are also misunderstood, so a fight between the workers and the foreman ensues. \"As if by a miracle,\" Nazario sees Beatriz again in another town. He reveals his possessions have been stolen. She leads him to Andara, who lives with her, and a sick girl whose mother begs Nazario to cure with a miracle. Nazario suggests a doctor, but offers to pray with them. He is perturbed when the woman performs superstitious rites. The girl's fever subsides. Believing Nazario to be a miracle-worker, Andara and Beatriz follow him despite his protests. Nazario stops to help a party whose horse has a broken leg. The Colonel yells at a peasant who does not salute them, despite the peasant's protestations that he didn't see them. When Nazario criticises the Colonel's rudeness, the latter tries to pull his gun, but is stopped by the Priest, who excuses Nazario as \"a heretic, an erratic preacher\" who should be left alone. Nazario is followed by Beatriz and Andara, whom he reluctantly tolerates, and sermonizes them. In a plague-ridden village, Nazario's help is rejected by one dying woman, who prefers her husband's ministrations (inspired by the Marquis de Sade's Dialogue Between a Priest and a Dying Man). Nazario is overcome by a feeling of failure. A midget professes love for Andara despite saying she is ugly. Beatrice's ex Pinto, visiting, sees her, accuses her of being \"a priest's lover\" and demands that she leave with him. Nazario says she is struggling with Satan but should resist. When she asks how he guessed something was wrong, Nazario responds, \"It's not guessing; it's knowing.\" Andara insists that they flee. Nazario responds only thieves flee and the divine will not forsake them. Beatriz tells Nazario she trusts him, and quotes from the Bible: \"If I can carry your load on my back, I will\". Andara accuses Nazario of preferring Beatriz, but he asserts a Christian love for both. Discovered by a search party, Andara and Nazario are arrested: Beatriz begs for his release. Pinto tells Beatriz's mother that Beatriz should go with him. However, Beatriz sings Nazario's praises and speaks of his miracles. Her mother's response that Beatriz loves Nazario \"like a man\" sends Beatriz into a psychotic episode. Nazario's cellmates insult and assault him. Nazario suffers a crisis of faith, shouting, \"For the first time in my life, I find it hard to forgive. But I forgive you. It is my Christian duty. But I also scorn you! And I feel guilty, not knowing how to separate scorn from forgiveness.\" A cellmate intervenes and Nazario gives him his money. Nazario is accused of insanity and disobedience. As he is led away, Pinto and Beatriz pass by, but without recognition. Nazario passes a fruit seller who offers a pineapple, saying, \"Take this charity, and may God be with you.\" Nazario seems overcome with confusion. He refuses it twice, but then takes it and says, \"May God repay you.\" He is led away, distraught.",

    "Synopsis": "Policarpo De 'Tappetti is a modest ministerial employee of Umbertine Rome: he is precise and diligent, but his excesses of zeal attract him the antipathy of Cavalier Cesare Pancarano di Rondò, his severe office manager, as well as aristocratic aristocrat convinced that he is related to the reigning Savoy dynasty, which is why he spends good money on complex genealogical research in order to ascertain its veracity. The respective families of the two meet by chance while walking on the Pincio, and the son of Pancarano di Rondò, Gerolamo, falls in love with Celeste, the young and pretty daughter of Polycarp; in front of her insistent court that Gegè of her, a fatuous and superficial character of her, the girl appears rather perplexed, but she agrees to become engaged to him at the insistence of her parents, who foresee for her a brilliant wedding. Cavalier Pancarano di Rondò, however, does not look favorably on the bond between the two young men, since, considering himself to be of noble lineage, he would like to see his son married to a young lady from the great world \". So to distract Gegè from the idea of marrying Celeste , the knight approaches Edelweiss, a subretta of café-chantant with whom the young man had previously been in love, and convinces her to be seen in a bathing suit on the beach of Ostia, where Gegé plans to go with his girlfriend. they go as expected by the knight: Gegè leaves Celeste to run after his old flame. In the meantime Celeste falls in love with Mario Marchetti, a serious and honest young mechanic who teaches her to type, wanting the girl to find a job as a typist. Polycarp at first strongly opposes Mario's courtship of his daughter and the idea of Celeste going to work, but in the end he is forced to give in. Celeste then becomes engaged to Mario, while Polycarp, a graduate calligrapher and archenemy of the typewriter, will have to become a typist by order of the Ministry, otherwise he will lose his job. He will therefore - to everyone's surprise - show off this technical innovation on the occasion of the minister's visit for the inauguration of the new typing system, quickly typing the famous chorus from Il Conte di Carmagnola by Alessandro Manzoni («S'ode a right a trumpet blast [...]»). Meanwhile, Cavalier Pancarano di Rondò has received unwelcome news: Gegè, who fled with Edelweiss, is married to her in Venice. Immediately afterwards, moreover, the scholars who on his behalf were looking for genealogical documents certifying his alleged blue blood inform him that an ancestor of his was called Biancamano not because he was related to the reigning Savoy dynasty, but because of his profession as a painter. At this point Cavalier Pancarano decides to be more friendly with Policarpo. In the final scene, the splendid cameo of Amedeo Nazzari in the role of a carabiniere who stops a runaway horse.",

    "Synopsis": "Soon after the Second World War, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England, Joe Lampton, an ambitious young man, moves from his hometown, the dreary factory town of Dufton, to the somewhat larger town of Warnley to assume a secure but poorly paid and dead-end post in the Borough Treasurer's Department. Determined to get ahead, and ignoring the warnings of his colleague and flatmate Charlie Soames, he pursues Susan Brown, the daughter of a local industrial magnate. She has been dating wealthy Jack Wales but Joe is able to charm her. Mr and Mrs Brown attempt to frustrate Joe's social climbing by persuading Joe's boss to encourage him to pursue a woman of his own class; getting him a job offer back in Dufton, which he refuses when he discovers the machination; and sending Susan on a trip abroad, but Susan remains smitten. While pursuing Susan, Joe continues to see Alice Aisgill, an unhappily married Frenchwoman ten years his senior who came to England as a teacher a decade earlier and married George Aisgill, a haughty and abusive upper-middle class Englishman who is now having numerous affairs. Joe thinks he is just killing time with Alice and Alice says they can just be \"loving friends\". Their feelings for each other begin to turn into something more and Joe starts to lose interest in his pursuit of Susan. The relationship is passionate, tempestuous and after a particularly heated argument, Joe switches his focus back to Susan. He manages to take her virginity but is unsatisfied and finds himself drawn back to Alice. Joe and Alice go away on a short holiday and Alice is overjoyed that Joe seems to have decided to end his quest for wealth and social status in favour of simply being happy with himself and with her. They decide she will ask for a divorce when she gets home but when she does, George refuses and declares he will ruin Joe and Alice, both socially and financially, if their relationship continues. While Joe is brooding over this, Mr Brown delivers the news that Susan is pregnant and that he expects Joe to stop seeing Alice and marry Susan, in which case Joe can come to work for him at a generous salary. Seeing no way around his obstacles to a relationship with Alice, Joe tells her that he is going to marry Susan. Heartbroken, Alice gets drunk in a pub and the next morning, while his co-workers are celebrating his engagement, Joe hears that she drove her car off a cliff to which she and he used to go together and died slowly over the course of several hours. Devastated, Joe leaves the office and wanders to the flat where he and Alice had their trysts but Alice's friend Elspeth, who owns the flat, drives him away by screaming at him and blaming him for Alice's death. Joe goes to a pub on the waterfront, where a woman named Mavis comes on to him because he is well-dressed. Although he is very drunk and does not seem very interested in her (he calls her Alice), Joe keeps a man from taking Mavis away against her will. When Joe is alone, the man and some of his friends beat Joe unconscious. In the morning, Charlie finds Joe lying in the street with a battered face but Joe's only concern is his guilt over what he feels he led Alice to do. A short time later, Joe and Susan get married. With a rich wife and high-paying job, he has got everything he thought he wanted. As they are driven away after the wedding, Susan's effusive praise of the ceremony is cut short when she notices that there are tears in Joe's eyes, which she misinterprets by saying \"I believe you really are sentimental after all\".",

    "Synopsis": "In a small Bulgarian town in 1943: A non-commissioned Wehrmacht officer by the name of Walter is tasked with supervising the civilian workers in a motor vehicle workshop, yet the former painter much prefers to just sit back and draw the area and people of the town. Walter's supervisor mockingly calls him \"Rembrandt,\" but his best friend, Lieutenant Kurt, is proud to have a portrait done by him. Walter, especially, seems to enjoy being away from the war. One day, Greek Sephardic Jews reach the small town, where they are kept as prisoners in a nearby concentration camp until they can be transported to Auschwitz. Through the barbed wire fence, Ruth, a Jewish woman, asks Walter for help with a woman giving birth. As Walter disinterestedly refuses, Ruth calls him a wolf and a rat, full of contempt. A little later, Walter appears again in the camp with a doctor, who was able to help the exhausted woman bring a child into the world. In the evening, Walter finds it difficult to sleep, and wanders around the village. He sees that the motor vehicle shop has been broken into, where he finds the lighter of a Bulgarian man named Bai Petko, but he chooses not to tell on the man. The next day, the partisan soldiers secretly arrive at Petko’s home. This “doctor,” who treats the partisan soldiers in the woods, needs medication, which Petko in turn hopes to get by bribing Walter. He tells him that the medicine is for the Jews in the camp, so Walter smuggles a package of medicine to Blashe, one of Petko’s errand boys. Walter is in a pub with Kurt in the evening. While Kurt had found some Bulgarian women, Walter had a woman from the concentration camp come—Ruth. Walter and Ruth, followed by a guard, walked the night streets of the small town, and slowly got to know each other. After Walter leaves Ruth at the camp gate, he wonders to himself what one can do. The next day, Walter learns that Blashe had been caught by the Bulgarian police with the medicine. Blashe and Walter do not tell on each other, but Kurt has the Jews of the camp searched for medicine and punishes them when he finds parts of the stolen goods with them. Walter realizes that by trying to do good he did not accomplish any good. He turns to Petko, who lied to him about using the medicine. Petko in turn suspects Walter of telling on Blashe to the police, but Walter gives Petko back his lighter, proving he was on Petko’s side the whole time. In the evening, Walter meets with Ruth again, who was brought to him on Kurt’s initiative. Walter implores her to escape, but Ruth initially refuses. It is only at the end of a long conversation that Ruth finally agrees to flee the next night. Yet back in the camp, she is described by the other prisoners as a spy, and she breaks down crying in her father’s arms; after all, she had done nothing wrong. Walter asks Kurt the next day when the Jews are supposed to be deported, and Kurt replies, “Tomorrow.” Kurt senses that Walter has fallen in love with Ruth, especially because he finds a portrait of Ruth in Walter’s drawing pad. Walter uses the day in order to organize an escape for Ruth through Petko. Petko also confesses to him that the partisan soldiers actually wanted to steal weapons when they broke into the motor vehicle workshop. When the escape plan is finally in place, Walter wants to use a ruse to get Ruth out of the camp, but the Jews have already been deported by that time. He runs to the train platform but can only see the departing cattle cars with Ruth inside. In his room, Walter finds the portrait of Ruth, on which Kurt has written that he lied about the departure time for Walter’s own good. Walter joins Petko, and they both begin to work out how to supply the partisan soldiers with weapons. The final shot shows Ruth in the cattle car, as the song “It Burns (Es brennt)” plays.",

    "Synopsis": "thumb|Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) in the final scene Antoine Doinel is a young boy growing up in Paris. Misunderstood by his parents for skipping school and stealing, and tormented in school for disciplinary problems by his teacher (such as writing on the classroom wall and later lying about his absences as being due to his mother's death), he frequently runs away from both places. He finally quits school after his teacher accuses him of plagiarizing Balzac, though Antoine loves Balzac and in a school essay he describes \"the death of my grandfather,\" in a close paraphrase of Balzac from memory. He steals a Royal typewriter from his stepfather's workplace to finance his plans to leave home, but being unable to sell it, he is apprehended while trying to return it. The stepfather turns Antoine over to police and Antoine spends the night in jail, sharing a cell with prostitutes and thieves. During an interview with the judge, Antoine's mother confesses that her husband is not her son's biological father. Antoine is placed in an observation center for troubled youths near the seashore (as his mother wished). A psychologist at the center looks for reasons for Antoine's unhappiness, which the youth reveals in a fragmented series of monologues. While playing football with the other boys, Antoine escapes under a fence and runs away to the ocean, which he has always wanted to see. He reaches the shoreline of the sea and runs into it. The film concludes with a freeze-frame of Antoine, which, via an optical effect, zooms in on his face as he looks into the camera.",

    "film_title": "The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film)",
    "Synopsis": "thumb|The film's trailer In 1945, after World War II, Otto Frank returns to the Amsterdam garret where his family hid for more than 2 years before being arrested by the Nazis. He is accompanied by Miep Gies and Mr. Kraler, his Christian employees who shielded the Jewish Frank family and 4 others. When Otto searches for the diary kept by his youngest daughter, Anne, Miep promptly retrieves it for him. In July 1942, Anne writes of the restrictions placed on Jews that drove the Franks into hiding over their spice factory. Sharing the Franks' hiding place are the Van Daans and their teenage son, Peter. Kraler and Miep have conspired with Otto to prepare the hideaway. Those hiding are warned to maintain strict silence during daylight while workers are present. Kraler delivers food and a box for Anne, compiled by Otto, containing her beloved movie star photos and a blank diary. As months pass, Anne teases Peter, whose only attachment is to his cat, Mouschi. Otto teaches Anne and her sister, Margot, while Petronella Van Daan passes the time reminiscing of her youth. The strain of confinement causes the Van Daans to argue and pits Anne against her mother, Edith. Kraler brings a radio that provides news of the world. Conditions are growing more dire, with Jews suddenly disappearing, shipped to concentration camps. Kraler asks them to take in another person, Miep's Jewish dentist named Albert Dussel, who confirms that many of their friends have disappeared. Dreaming of one of her friends in a concentration camp, Ann wakes up screaming. In October 1942, news comes of the Allied landing in Africa, and the bombing of Amsterdam intensifies. During Hanukkah, Van Daan abruptly announces that Peter must get rid of Mouschi, who consumes too much food. Their argument is cut short when they hear a prowler break in the front door; the room falls silent until Peter crashes into an object while trying to catch Mouschi. The startled thief grabs a typewriter and flees. A watchman summons police officers, who search the premises, but on hearing Mouschi voice a sound, they are reassured the noise was caused by a stray cat and leave. In January 1944, Anne begins to attract Peter's attention, and Miep brings the group a luxurious cake. Van Daan asks Miep to sell Petronella's fur coat so he can buy cigarettes. Kraler warns that one of the employees asked for a raise after implying that something strange is going on in the attic. Dussel dourly comments that it is just a matter of time before they are discovered. Blaming the adults for the war that has destroyed all hope, Anne storms out of the room; Peter follows to comfort her. Anne confides her dreams of becoming a writer, and Peter voices frustration over his inability to join the war effort. Catching Van Daan trying to steal bread, Edith denounces him, ordering his family to leave. As Dussel and Mrs. Van Daan quarrel over food, word comes over the radio of the Allied invasion of France, and Van Daan breaks into tears of shame. Heartened by the news, everyone apologizes for their harsh words. Anne dreams of being back in school by autumn. By July 1944 the invasion bogs down, and Kraler is hospitalized with ulcers. The police have found the stolen typewriter, and Anne muses that her diary provides a way to live on after death. The Van Daans resume quarrelling, and Peter declares he cannot tolerate the situation. Anne soothes him by reminding him of the goodness of those who have come to their aid. The sirens of an approaching police van interrupt their conversation. Certain of impending arrest, they kiss. As the German police break open the bookcase entrance, Otto declares they no longer live in fear, but can go forward in hope. In 1945, Otto relates to Miep and Kraler his long journey from Auschwitz. Learning of the deaths of Edith, Margot, the Van Daans, and Dussel, he hoped that Anne had survived until meeting a woman from Bergen-Belsen who confirmed Anne's death. Opening Anne's diary, Otto reads, \"In spite of everything, I still believe that people are really good at heart,\" reflecting upon Anne's unshakeable optimism.",

    "Synopsis": "A middle-aged farm woman walks through her village and gazes down a country road. A voiceover reveals that her son was killed in the war and buried in a foreign land. On the Eastern Front, nineteen-year-old Private Alyosha Skvortsov (Vladimir Ivashov) single-handedly destroys two attacking German tanks, more out of self-preservation than bravery. His commanding general wants to give him a decoration, but Alyosha asks instead for a leave to see his mother and to repair the leaking roof of their home. He is given six days. During his journey, he sees the devastation the war has wrought on the country and meets various people. When the jeep Alyosha is riding gets stuck in the mud, Private Pavlov helps push it out. As Alyosha will be passing through his home city, Pavlov persuades him to take a present to Pavlov's wife. Pavlov's sergeant reluctantly parts with two bars of soap, the entire supply for their platoon. At the train station, Alyosha helpfully carries the suitcase of Vasya, a soldier discharged because he has lost a leg. Vasya does not want to go home, as he would be a burden to his wife, and their relationship had already been troubled. However, he changes his mind and is welcomed with open arms by the loving woman. When he attempts to board a freight car of an army supply train, Alyosha is stopped by Gavrilkin, a sentry. However, a bribe of a can of beef eases Gavrilkin's fear of his lieutenant, a \"beast\". Shura (Zhanna Prokhorenko) later sneaks aboard as well, but when she sees him, she becomes frightened and tries to jump off the speeding train. Alyosha stops her from risking her life. She tells him she is going to see her fiancé, a pilot who is recuperating in a hospital. As the hours pass, she loses her fear and mistrust of him. Gavrilkin spots the civilian stowaway, forcing Alyosha to bribe him anew. When the lieutenant discovers the unauthorized passengers, he lets them remain aboard and even makes Gavrilkin return the bribe. At one stop, Alyosha gets out to fetch some water, but the train leaves without him. Frantic, he gets a lift to the next station from an old woman truck driver. He is too late; the train has already departed. However, Shura got off and is waiting for him. The couple then go to see Pavlov's wife. They discover that she is living with another man and leave. Alyosha returns, takes back the soap he had given her, and gives it instead to Pavlov's invalid father. When they finally part, Shura confesses she lied; there was no fiancé, only an aunt. Alyosha realizes too late, after his train departs, that when Shura said she had no one, she was telling him that she loves him. His train is stopped by a blown-up bridge and set on fire by German bombers. With time running out, Alyosha rafts across the river and persuades another truck driver to give him a ride to his rural village, Sosnovka. He gets to see his mother only for a few minutes before having to make his way back to his unit. His mother vows to wait for him. The voiceover tells us that while he could have gone far in life if he had lived, he will always be remembered simply as a Russian soldier.",

Wade's scornful but beautiful wife Hannah has raised their son Theron to be dependent upon her, but as he reaches adulthood his father seeks to help Theron become a man. Wade introduces Theron to hunting and other masculine pursuits under the watchful eye of Rafe, Hunnicutt's loyal employee. Theron admires the slightly older and self-reliant Rafe, and rapidly develops into a marksman and skilled hunter. He also learns about women from Rafe. Theron's new lifestyle leads him into a love affair with Libby Halstead, a local girl from a proper family, but her father Albert's animosity forces a secret relationship. Theron learns from his mother that the reason for Libby's father's scorn is Wade's reputation as a womanizer, that Rafe is his illegitimate half-brother, and that his parents have not been intimate since before he was born. Theron becomes disturbed by his parents' dysfunctional relationship and his father's treatment of Rafe. Theron rejects his parents as well as the concept of family, and thus Libby, his true love. Though Theron does not know, Libby is pregnant, but she does not want her pregnancy to be the reason for their marriage. Confused and despondent, Libby turns to Rafe, who out of attraction and compassion agrees to marry her. Realizing his error, Theron is devastated. On the day of Libby's newborn son's baptism, her father overhears gossip that Captain Hunnicutt fathered the child and is enraged. Wade and Hannah seek to reconcile after 17 years. After Hannah leaves the room, Wade is shot down by an unknown assailant who escapes. Theron tracks down his father's murderer and sees that it is Albert. Theron kills Albert in self-defense and soon after Rafe catches up. Though Rafe objects, Theron leaves town, promising never to return. Several months later, Rafe encounters Hannah at Wade's grave. He offers to include her in the life of her grandson, and she shows him that she has acknowledged him as Wade's son on the headstone.",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot should be between 400 and 700 words --> Three wealthy Italians—Anna, her boyfriend Sandro, and her friend Claudia—plan a Mediterranean yacht trip to celebrate Sandro's return from a long business trip. Before leaving, Anna visits her father, who senses that her relationship with Sandro is not going well. When Anna meets Sandro in Rome, the reunion is distant and awkward. Even so, the two eventually make love in his house while Claudia waits. Sandro drives the two women to the coast, where they join the other members of their voyage, two affluent couples who also have difficult relationships. The next day, the group reaches the Aeolian Islands, and Anna jumps into the water for a swim. Sandro follows her when she claims to have seen a shark, only to discover later that it was a lie. The group tours a desolate island with steep cliffs. Anna tells Sandro that she is unhappy with his frequent business trips, but he dismisses her concerns and takes a nap on the rocks. Anna goes missing. Sandro brushes it off as typical behavior, but when she fails to reappear, the group searches the island for her, to no avail. Sandro, Corrado and Claudia stay behind to continue the search, while the others notify the authorities. Claudia suggests to Sandro that his neglect may have played a role in Anna's disappearance, offending Sandro. The police and Anna's father arrive, but they cannot find Anna either. Claudia and Sandro split up to continue the search. Sandro decides to investigate local smugglers, while Claudia decides to search the remaining islands alone. They agree to meet up later in Palermo, but Sandro startles Claudia by kissing her before leaving. The smugglers have no information about Anna's disappearance. Sandro and Claudia meet at the train station. Their mutual attraction is evident. To avoid Sandro, Claudia boards a train to Palermo and asks him to stay behind. Sandro considers it, but boards the train anyway. Claudia is annoyed, but Sandro sees no sense in sacrificing their attraction. Claudia is troubled by how easily things can change. Sandro relents and gets off the train at Castroreale. In Messina, Sandro meets with journalist Zuria, who suggests Anna may have been seen by a chemist in Troina. Sandro heads for Troina, but not before bribing Zuria to print the story in the newspaper. Meanwhile, Claudia arrives at Corrado's villa, where no one takes Anna's disappearance seriously. She reads Zuria's story and travels to Troina, where she runs into Sandro. They agree to continue the search together. Sandro and Claudia interview the chemist Zuria mentioned, who claims to have sold tranquilizers to Anna. They learn that the woman left for Noto in southern Sicily. Together, they drive south. They stop at a deserted village and make love on a hill overlooking the town. In Noto, they search for Anna at the Trinacria Hotel, but find nothing. Their increasing ennui is briefly interrupted when they ring bells at a local church, but the moment passes. While passing the time, Sandro casually ruins a local artist's drawing; the artist thinks he did it intentionally. Claudia remains conflicted between her feelings for Sandro and her loyalty to Anna. Even so, when Sandro hesitates to tell her he loves her, Claudia is disappointed. Eventually, the two tell each other they are in love. At the Chiesa del Collegio, Sandro reveals his disappointment with his career and proposes to Claudia, but she declines. The next morning, Sandro and Claudia both seem to be passionately in love, but Claudia resists his advances and suggests they leave. In Taormina, Sandro and Claudia stay at the San Domenico Palace Hotel while Sandro's boss and his wife prepare for a party. Claudia decides to skip it, while Sandro checks out the women and recognizes Gloria Perkins, a beautiful 19-year-old \"writer\" and aspiring actress who is actually a high-end prostitute. Later, Claudia searches for Sandro. She visits Sandro's boss' hotel room, but Sandro is not there. She confides in the boss' wife that she is scared that Anna has reappeared and retaken Sandro. She questions why she would feel relieved for her friend to be dead. Claudia eventually finds Sandro in a compromising position with Gloria. Heartbroken, Claudia runs off, and Sandro follows her to the hotel terrace, which has a view of a bombed-out church. Both of them are crying. Claudia considers whether to extend a comforting hand to Sandro. After some thought, she places her hand on Sandro's head. They enigmatically gaze at Mount Etna in the distance.",

    "Unnamed: 0": 391,
    "year": 1960,
    "film_title": "La Dolce Vita",
    "Synopsis": "1st Day Sequence: A helicopter transports a statue of Christ over an ancient Roman aqueduct outside Rome while a second, Marcello Rubini's news helicopter, follows it into the city. The news helicopter is momentarily sidetracked by a group of bikini-clad women sunbathing on the rooftop of a high-rise apartment building. Hovering above, Marcello uses gestures to elicit phone numbers from them but fails in his attempt. He then shrugs and continues following the statue to Saint Peter's Square. 1st Night Sequence: Marcello meets Maddalena by chance in an exclusive nightclub. A beautiful and wealthy heiress, Maddalena is tired of Rome, while Marcello finds it suits him. They have sex in the bedroom of a sex worker whom they had given a ride home in Maddalena's Cadillac. 1st Dawn Sequence: Marcello returns to his apartment to find that his fiancée, Emma, has overdosed. On the way to the hospital, he declares his everlasting love to her and again as she lies in a semiconscious state in the emergency room. While waiting frantically for her recovery, however, he tries to make a phone call to Maddalena. 2nd Day Sequence: That day, he goes on assignment for the arrival of Sylvia, a famous Swedish-American actress, at Ciampino airport where she is met by a horde of news reporters. During Sylvia's press conference, Marcello calls home to ensure Emma has taken her medication while reassuring her that he is not alone with Sylvia. After the film star confidently replies to the barrage of journalists' questions, her boyfriend Robert enters the room late and drunk. Marcello casually recommends to Sylvia's producer that she be taken on a tour of St Peter's. Inside St Peter's dome, a news reporter complains that Sylvia is \"an elevator\" because none of them can match her energetic climb up the numerous flights of stairs. Inspired, Marcello maneuvers forward to be alone with her when they finally reach the balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square. They almost share a kiss. 2nd Night Sequence: That evening, the infatuated Marcello dances with Sylvia in the Baths of Caracalla. Sylvia's natural sensuality triggers raucous partying while Robert, her bored fiancé, draws caricatures and reads a newspaper. His humiliating remark to her causes Sylvia to leave the group, eagerly followed by Marcello and his paparazzi colleagues. Finding themselves alone, Marcello and Sylvia spend the rest of the evening in the alleys of Rome, where they wade into the Trevi Fountain. 2nd Dawn Sequence: Like a magic spell that has suddenly been broken, dawn arrives at the very moment Sylvia playfully \"anoints\" Marcello's head with fountain water. They drive back to Sylvia's hotel to find an enraged Robert waiting for her in his car. Robert slaps Sylvia, orders her to go to bed, and then assaults Marcello, who takes it in stride. 3rd Day Sequence: Marcello meets Steiner, his distinguished intellectual friend, inside a church. Steiner shows off his book of Sanskrit grammar. The two go up to play the organ, offering up a jazz piece for the watching priest before playing Bach. 3rd Day Sequence: Late afternoon, Marcello, his photographer friend Paparazzo, and Emma drive to the outskirts of Rome to cover the story of the purported sighting of the Madonna by two children. Although the Catholic Church is officially skeptical, a huge crowd of devotees and reporters gathers at the site. 3rd Night Sequence: That night, the event is broadcast over Italian radio and television. Emma prays to the Virgin Mary to be given sole possession of Marcello's heart. Blindly following the two children from corner to corner in a downpour, the crowd tears a small tree apart for its branches and leaves said to have sheltered the Madonna. 3rd Dawn Sequence: The gathering ends at dawn with the crowd mourning a sick child, a pilgrim brought by his mother to be healed, but trampled to death in the melee. 4th Night Sequence: One evening, Marcello and Emma attend a gathering at Steiner's luxurious home, where they are introduced to a group of intellectuals who recite poetry, strum the guitar, offer philosophical ideas, and listen to sounds of nature recorded on tape. The British poet Iris Tree, whose poetry Marcello has read and admired, recommends that Marcello avoid the \"prisons\" of commitment: \"Stay free, available, like me. Never get married. Never choose. Even in love, it's better to be chosen.\" Emma appears enchanted with Steiner's home and children, telling Marcello that one day he will have a home like Steiner's, but he turns away moodily. Outside on the terrace, Marcello confesses to Steiner his admiration for all he stands for, but Steiner admits he is torn between the security that a materialistic life affords and his longing for a more spiritual albeit insecure way of life. Steiner philosophizes about the need for love in the world and fears what his children may grow up to face one day. 5th Day Sequence: Marcello spends the afternoon working on his novel at a seaside restaurant, where he meets Paola, a young waitress from Perugia playing Perez Prado's cha-cha “Patricia” on the jukebox and then humming its tune. He asks her if she has a boyfriend, then describes her as an angel in Umbrian paintings. 5th Night Sequence: Marcello meets his father visiting Rome on the Via Veneto. With Paparazzo, they go to the \"Cha-Cha\" Club, where Marcello introduces his father to Fanny, a beautiful dancer and one of his past girlfriends (he had promised to get her picture in the paper but failed to do it). Fanny takes a liking to his father. Marcello tells Paparazzo that as a child he had never seen much of his father, who would spend weeks away from home. Fanny invites Marcello's father back to her flat, and two other dancers invite the two younger men to go with them. Marcello leaves the others when they get to the dancers' neighborhood. Fanny comes out of her house, upset that Marcello's father has become ill. 5th Dawn Sequence: Marcello's father has suffered what seems to be a mild heart attack. Marcello wants him to stay with him in Rome so they can get to know each other, but his father, weakened, wants to go home and gets in a taxi to catch the first train to Cesena. He leaves Marcello forlorn, on the street, watching the taxi leave. 6th Night Sequence: Marcello, Nico, and other friends meet on the Via Veneto and are driven to a castle owned by aristocrats at Bassano di Sutri outside Rome. There is already a party long in progress, and the party-goers are bleary-eyed and intoxicated. By chance, Marcello meets Maddalena again. The two of them explore a suite of ruins annexed to the castle. Maddalena seats Marcello in a vast room and then closets herself in another room connected by an echo chamber. As a disembodied voice, Maddalena asks him to marry her; Marcello professes his love for her, avoiding answering her proposal. Another man kisses and embraces Maddalena, who loses interest in Marcello. He rejoins the group, and eventually spends the night with Jane, a British artist and heiress. 6th Dawn Sequence: Burnt out and bleary-eyed, the group returns at dawn to the main section of the castle, to be met by the matriarch of the castle, who is on her way to mass, accompanied by priests in a procession. 7th Night Sequence: Marcello and Emma are alone in his sports car on an isolated road. Emma continues an argument by professing her love and tries to get out of the car; Marcello pleads with her not to get out. Emma says that Marcello will never find another woman who loves him the way she does. Marcello becomes enraged, telling her that he cannot live with her smothering, maternal love. He now wants her to get out of the car, but she refuses. With some violence (a bite from her and a slap from him), he throws her out of the car and drives off, leaving her alone on a deserted road at night. 7th Dawn Sequence: Emma hears Marcello's car returning as she holds wildflowers picked from the roadside. She gets into the car with neither of them saying a word. Later, they are asleep in bed, tenderly intertwined, when Marcello receives a phone call. He rushes to the Steiners' apartment and learns that Steiner has killed his two children and himself. Marcello is interrogated by the police and afterwards volunteers to accompany an officer on his way to meet Steiner's wife. 8th Day Sequence: After waiting at the bus stop, Marcello identifies Steiner's wife when she arrives. He and the officer escort her to the car to break the terrible news, while the paparazzi swarm around them snapping pictures. 8th Night Sequence: An unspecified amount of time later, an older Marcello—now with gray in his hair—has quit journalism and abandoned his attempt at writing a book to become a publicist. He and a group of partygoers break into a Fregene beach house owned by Riccardo, a friend of Marcello's. Many of the men are homosexual. To celebrate her recent divorce from Riccardo, Nadia performs a striptease to Perez Prado's cha-cha “Patricia”. Riccardo shows up at the house and tells the partiers to leave. The drunken Marcello attempts to provoke the other partygoers into an orgy. However, their inebriation causes the party to descend into mayhem, with Marcello riding a young woman crawling on her hands and knees and throwing pillow feathers around the room. 8th Dawn Sequence: The party proceeds to the beach at dawn where they find a modern-day leviathan, a bloated, sea ray-like creature, caught in the fishermen's nets. In his stupor, Marcello comments on how its eyes stare even in death. 9th Day Sequence: Paola, the adolescent waitress from the seaside restaurant in Fregene, calls to Marcello from across an estuary, but the words they exchange are lost on the wind, drowned out by the crashing waves. He signals his inability to understand what she is saying or interpret her gestures. He shrugs and returns to the partygoers; one of the women joins him and they hold hands as they walk away from the beach. In a long final close-up, Paola waves to Marcello and then stands watching him with an enigmatic smile.",

    "Synopsis": "A guide, Konstantin Sabin, and three geologists—Tanya, Andrei, and Sergei—are brought by plane to the boreal forest of central Siberia to search for diamonds. During the plane ride, Konstantin begins writing a letter to his wife detailing his feelings about the expedition. Early on in their search, Sergei expresses jealousy toward Andrei, who is the object of Tanya's affection. Tensions rise between the two while bird hunting for food, resulting in Sergei punching Andrei in the face. After failing to find diamonds while panning in rivers, the group begin a protracted job excavating on a mountainside with pickaxes. When they have reached the point of complete exhaustion, Tanya finally spots diamonds in the earth, leading the group to carry on a rapturous celebration. Andrei uses his radio to inform the base camp in Petrov about the discovery, and the group prepare to return to civilization, packing their supplies in their canoe. In the middle of the night, they awaken to find themselves in the midst of a forest fire. Sergei attempts to obtain some of the supplies packed in the canoe but is killed when a burning tree falls on him. Using his radio, Andrei contacts the Petrov base camp, but the receivers are unable to hear them; they merely congratulate the group on their discovery, as well as its significance for the Soviet Union, informing them that they have received a congratulatory telegram from Moscow. Shortly after, the trio receive a message via radio that search parties have begun looking for them. An aircraft dispatched to search for them flies overhead, but they are unable to get its attention. The group presses on but is forced to carry an injured Andrei on a makeshift gurney. Andrei, feeling himself to be a burden, begs Konstantin and Tanya to abandon him, but they refuse. Upon waking one morning, Konstantin and Tanya find that Andrei has disappeared, devastating Tanya. Konstantin and Tanya press on, encountering another plane overhead, but again are unable to get the pilot's attention. Defeated, the two lie down on a hillside to rest, and awaken covered in snow. As the weather conditions worsen, Tanya eventually succumbs to the elements, leaving Konstantin alone. Still determined, Konstantin uses a makeshift raft to float down the frozen river. En route, he has a vision of himself returning to safety, greeted by his wife Vera and their son. Konstantin eventually loses consciousness, and his raft drifts into a snowbank on the river. Shortly after, searchers in a helicopter spot him lying in the snow, and descend upon the river. They initially presume him dead, but while they listen for his heartbeat with a stethoscope, he slowly opens his eyes.",

    "film_title": "Macario (film)",
    "Synopsis": "thumb|left|upright|Pina Pellicer photographed for the film. She plays Macario's wife The story centers on Macario, a poor Indigenous woodcutter, during Colonial Mexico, on the eve of the Day of the Dead, who lives embittered for being so poor and hungry. His economic situation keeps him and his family at the edge of starvation. After he sees a procession of roast turkeys, his dream is to eat a whole roast turkey just by himself. He announces in front of his wife and children that he will not eat until his dream comes true. His worried wife steals a turkey and gives it to Macario before he heads to the mountains to work. However, just as Macario prepares to eat the turkey, three men appear to him. The first one is the Devil in the guise of a fine gentleman, who tempts Macario in order to get a piece of the turkey. The second one is God in the guise of an old man. Macario refuses to share the turkey with either, since he believes that they both have the means necessary to get themselves what they want. When a third figure —a peasant like himself— appears to him, he gladly shares the turkey with the man. The third man is none other than Death itself. Death is unsure why Macario has shared his turkey with him and not with the Devil and God. Macario responds, \"Whenever you appear, there is no time for anything else.\" Macario hoped to forestall what he assumed to be his imminent death by gaining the time it would take for him and Death to eat. Death is amused and as a compensation, names Macario his \"friend\" and gives him miraculous water that will heal any disease. If Death appears at the feet of the sick person, they can be healed with the water - but if Death appears by the person's head he or she is condemned to die. This \"friendship\" lasts for years, but they never speak to each other, they merely stare. Death hints that Macario will meet him later that day. Macario returns home to find his son unconscious and badly injured from falling into a well. Macario heals his son with the water and eventually becomes known as a miraculous healer. Macario becomes wealthy from selling his cures, but creates such a commotion that he is arrested and accused of heresy. The Viceroy, however offers him freedom if he will cure his sick son. thumb|upright|Grutas de Cacahuamilpa National Park|Grutas de Cacahuamilpa, the place used for filming the \"Death's cavern\" Unfortunately for Macario, Death \"has to take the child,\" so Macario, in despair, begs and tries to escape, only to enter Death's cavern and is reprimanded for turning his \"gift\" into merchandise. Death shows him the candles that the cavern is filled with, thousands of candles, each representing a person's life. The making of the wax and length of the candle all factor into the lifespan of a given person. Death then snuffs out the candle of the Viceroy's son before Macario's eyes. When Macario sees how short his candle is, he begs Death to save it but Death refuses. In desperation, Macario snatches up his candle and runs out of the cavern, not heeding the shouts of Death behind him. The last scenes begin at twilight on the day that Macario shared the turkey with Death. He has not come home, and his wife and some villagers are looking for Macario out in the woods only to find him peacefully dead, next to a turkey divided in halves: one of which is eaten, the other being intact, as if he died not fulfilling his dream of eating a complete turkey for himself.",

    "Synopsis": "East Midlands housewife Gertrude Morel is miserable in her marriage to Walter, a coal miner who drinks heavily and sometimes shows his bitterness in violent ways. She has placed her hopes on her son Paul, who has the talent and ambition to become an artist, a dream that is mocked by Walter. Paul finds his desire to escape to a different life sidetracked by his mother's possessiveness, as well as by local girl Miriam Leivers, with whom he has an intellectual relationship that he would like to become physical. Miriam, however, is torn between her feelings and the views of her mother, who views sex as sinful and dirty. Paul's brother Arthur dies in a mining accident, and the Morel's eldest son, William, returns home for the funeral. As William's train back to London is about to depart, he reveals that he is engaged to be married to a pretty woman from an affluent family, a woman who the Morels later learn is the temperamental opposite of Gertrude—light-spirited, and not particularly passionate or intellectual. When a sketch Paul made of his father is exhibited in Nottingham, he overhears a wealthy art patron criticize the work, but the man later comes to the Morel house to offer to pay for Paul to attend art school in London, as he recognizes Paul's potential as an artist. Excited, Paul tells Miriam, but she rejects his physical advances. When Paul gets home, his parents have just had a violent confrontation, and he decides to forego art school, as he cannot bear to leave his mother alone with his father. Paul takes a job in a local lace factory, where he becomes enchanted with Clara Dawes, a \"liberated\" feminist co-worker who is separated—but not divorced—from her husband, Baxter. Nonetheless, he continues seeing Miriam, and she finally agrees to have sex with him, but he immediately regrets convincing her to do so, as she did not seem to enjoy the experience, and he decides to stop seeing her. He and Clara begin a passionate affair, but he is not able to totally commit himself to her, in large part due to his mother's emotional hold on him. While Paul and Claire are away on a trip to the seaside, Baxter confronts Walter in a pub and tells him to keep Paul away from Claire. Walter blames Gertrude's clinginess for preventing Paul from being able to have a normal romantic relationship with a woman his age, but Gertrude says all she ever wanted was for Paul to be happy. Baxter is waiting for Paul when he returns from the trip, and, although Baxter wins the fight, he is injured. Clara, who has noted Paul's emotional distance, returns to her husband to nurse him back to health. Gertrude has not seemed well recently, and, one evening, Paul comes home to discover that she has had a heart attack. She says she no longer wishes to see Walter, as she wants to remember the days when they were in love and not be reminded of all of the negative aspects of their current relationship. She dies early the next morning, and Walter tells Paul to not let her down like he did, encouraging him to go to London and, hopefully, find some happiness. On a walk in the woods, Paul meets Miriam. She apologizes for his loss, and they learn that they are both going to London—Paul to attend art school, and Miriam to train to be a teacher. She suggests they marry so she can care for him, but Paul rejects her proposal, telling her that, after having belonged to his mother, he wants to stay free so he can learn \"what it means to live.\"",

    "Synopsis": "Sujata is a romance between a Brahmin young man, Adheer and an untouchable woman, Sujata. It's also a story of the intense emotional conflict a mother faces in fully accepting an adopted daughter. The film has Mahatma Gandhi's fight against untouchability and the myth of Chandalika in Hinduism as its subtexts, based on which it tries to criticize the practice of untouchability in India. Brahmin couple, Upen and Charu bring up an orphaned child and name her Sujata. Although Upen is fond of the adopted child, his wife Charu and Aunt (Adheer's mother) can never fully embrace Sujata because she was born in an untouchable's family. They keep hinting to Sujata at times that she doesn't belong amongst Brahmins. Adheer falls in love with Sujata but Charu and Aunt want Adheer to marry Charu's real daughter Rama. Sujata also admires Adheer but finding her reality of being untouchable by birth feels uncomfortable. One day, Upen's wife falls down the stairs and is rushed to the hospital. The doctors tell the family that to save Charu, they need the rare group of blood. Only Sujata's blood matches and she willingly donates blood. When Charu become aware that her life was saved by Sujata, she realizes her mistake and accepts her as her daughter. Sujata and Adheer are then married happily by everyone's consent.",

    "Synopsis": "Claude Gaspard, a very polite prisoner, is moved to a cell containing four inmates due to repair works in his block. The four existing cellmates expect long prison sentences, ranging from 10 years to possibly execution by guillotine, and have a pre-existing plan to escape. Gaspard himself is accused of the attempted murder of his wife, and faces a potential 20-year sentence. Gaspard quickly gains their trust sufficiently for them to reveal their escape plan: digging a hole through the floor to reach the underground passages. The bulk of the film then focuses upon their gradual progress, which results in two men reaching an outer manhole in the public street outside the prison walls. However, the two do not escape, and instead return to the cell to organize the timing of the group escape. One of the cellmates, Geo, decides not to join in the escape. Just as they are ready to go, Gaspard gets called to a meeting with the warden, and is told that his wife has withdrawn the charges; and that he will be released soon. Returning to the cell, Gaspard has to dispel the suspicions of his cellmates that he had turned them in. However, in the last moments before the four are about to leave through their tunnel, a group of guards appears outside and they realize that they have been betrayed. A fight ensues in the cell and the guards intervene. Gaspard is moved to a different cell, while the original four are stripped to their underwear (before going into solitary confinement). It is left ambiguous as to what deal Gaspard has made with the authorities or whether he will ultimately be freed.",

    "film_title": "The Ninth Circle",
    "Synopsis": "In the early 1940s, following the German invasion of Yugoslavia and the establishment of the Ustaše-run Croatian Nazi puppet state, citizens of Zagreb face numerous hardships. The Jewish population, in particular, endures severe persecution and is targeted for extermination. To rescue Ruth, a Jewish girl, from the clutches of the Nazis and their collaborators, a Croatian Catholic family orchestrates her marriage to their young son, Ivo. While Ivo understands the necessity of this arrangement, he is deeply saddened by the abrupt end to his carefree youth. Initially, he appears to harbor disdain for Ruth, dismissing her as \"just a child,\" and continues to spend time with his close friend, Magda, with whom he also harbors romantic feelings. However, upon learning of Ivo's marriage, Magda distances herself from him. A drunken incident at Ivo's bachelor party strains their relationship further, leaving Ivo frustrated and causing an emotional outburst upon returning home. This prompts Ruth to flee into the night streets, where she almost exposes herself to a passing patrol before being rescued by Ivo's father. Ivo comes to realize that his previous behavior is reckless, selfish, and dangerously ignorant of the gravity of the situation. Following this realization, he begins to form a closer emotional bond with Ruth, spending time with her and even taking her out to a park, despite the prohibition against Jews doing so. However, their situation worsens when a member of the Ustaše humiliates Ruth in public. The situation is diffused by Zvonko, one of Ivo's classmates who has joined the Ustaše, but he later bullies Ivo in class by marking his coat with a symbol representing \"Židovi,\" the Croatian word for Jew. Witnessing this, Ruth is terrified, and Ivo tries to reassure her, marking several objects with the same symbol and referring to it as \"just a letter.\" Additionally, he gives her a miniature park to compensate for her inability to visit the real one. During a bomb alert, Ruth seizes a rare opportunity to venture out alone but is devastated when she discovers her father's name on a bulletin board, signifying his execution. Overwhelmed with grief, she breaks down in tears. As people return to the streets after the alert, an officer questions Ruth about her identity, leading to her arrest when she provides a false surname. Unable to find Ruth, Ivo decides to sneak into the local concentration camp against his parents' pleas. After questioning inmates, he learns that Ruth may be held in the Ninth Circle, known as the \"harem.\" As he approaches the camp's center, he encounters Zvonko, now a guard, who tries to portray camp life positively. They witness a group of children being loaded into a gas van, horrifying Ivo. Zvonko informs Ivo that the women in the Ninth Circle are scheduled for execution that night and suggests he \"say goodbye\" to Ruth. This prompts Ivo to confront Zvonko, potentially knocking him unconscious. Inside the Ninth Circle, Ivo witnesses a grotesque scene as Ustaše officers cruelly dance with terrified women. Spotting Ruth, Ivo rescues her, and they hide in a guard tower, planning to escape during the rumored power outage at midnight. However, when the time comes, Ruth, still barefoot, cannot cross the fence. Despite having the chance to save himself, Ivo chooses to stay with her. The film concludes with a shot of a light being turned back on, suggesting the tragic fate of both Ruth and Ivo.",

    "Synopsis": "In medieval Sweden, prosperous Christian Per Töre sends his daughter, Karin, to take candles to the church, a day's journey away. Karin is accompanied by servant Ingeri, who is pregnant with an out-of-wedlock child, and who secretly worships the Norse deity Odin. Along their way through the forest on horseback, Ingeri becomes frightened when they come to a stream-side mill and admonishes Karin, but Karin chooses to proceed on her own, leaving Ingeri at the mill. Ingeri encounters a one-eyed man at the mill. When Ingeri asks his name he enigmatically responds he has none \"in these days\". The man tells Ingeri that he can see and hear things others cannot. When the man makes sexual advances towards her and promises her power, Ingeri flees in terror. Meanwhile, Karin meets three herdsmen, two men and a boy, and invites them to eat her lunch with her. Eventually, the two older men rape and murder Karin. Ingeri, after having caught up to the group, witnesses the whole ordeal from a distance. The two older men then prepare to leave the scene with Karin's clothing. The younger boy is left with the body, but he takes the situation poorly, and is wracked with guilt. He even tries to bury the body by sprinkling dirt but stops midway, and runs along with the older men. The herders then, unknowingly, seek shelter at the home of the murdered girl. During the night, one of the goat herders offers to sell Karin's clothes to her mother, Märeta, and she suspects the worst. After they fall asleep, the mother locks the trio in the dining chamber and reveals her suspicions to Töre. Töre prepares to discover the truth about the situation and encounters Ingeri, who has returned. She breaks down in front of Töre and tells him about the rape and murder. She confesses that she secretly wished for Karin's death out of jealousy. In a fit of rage, Töre decides to murder the herdsmen at the crack of dawn. He stabs one of the older men to death with a butcher knife and throws the other into the fire. He kills the boy too, lifting and hurling him against the wall, while his wife watches horrified. Soon after, Karin's parents, along with the members of their household, set out to find their daughter's body with Ingeri leading the way. Töre breaks down on seeing Karin's body and calls upon God. He vows that, although he cannot understand why God would allow such a thing to happen, he will build a church at the site of his daughter's death. As her parents lift Karin's body from the ground, a spring emerges from the spot where her head rested. Ingeri proceeds to wash herself with the water while Karin's mother cleans the dirt from her daughter's face.",

    "film_title": "The Young One",
    "Synopsis": "When a white woman accuses him of raping her, Traver, a black clarinetist in a touring jazz band, steals a small boat to escape a lynch mob. He travels until the outboard motor runs out of gas, at which point he paddles to an island off the Carolina coast that is a private game preserve. It is not hunting season, so the island's only inhabitants are the caretakers Miller and Pee-Wee and Pee-Wee's teenage granddaughter Evalyn. Pee-Wee dies the same morning Traver comes to the island. Miller says he did not approve of how the elderly drunkard was raising Evvie, and he intends to put her in the care of the church and send her to the mainland so she can attend school. After he has her clean herself up and brush her wild hair, however, he notices she is growing up and comes on to her. Evvie escapes Miller's cabin and locks herself in hers with Pee-Wee's corpse. The next day, Jackson arrives on the island with supplies. He and Miller bury Pee-Wee, and Miller leaves with Jackson to alert the authorities to the death. Miller had told Evvie that she could go to town with Jackson, but now says he changed his mind. Thinking herself alone on the island, Evvie goes to work at the apiary until Traver appears and begs her for something to eat. She is initially frightened, but the dime he pays her for some honey and an apple puts her at ease, and she takes him back to Miller's cabin for a real meal. Evvie tries to stop Traver from taking some food and gas and a shotgun with him when he goes, though she relents when he gives her twenty dollars. Traver accidentally shoots a hole in his boat and gets supplies to repair it from Evvie. Miller returns in the morning, and Evvie, who does not think Traver is still on the island, tells him about Traver's visit. She does not mention the twenty dollars, so Miller takes a rifle and goes to look for the thief. Traver had fallen asleep before finishing his repairs, but he is just about to leave when he hears Miller approaching. He gets away on foot, and Miller shoots four holes in the boat and begins to track Traver through the woods. Sighting Traver crossing a swamp in a boat he has found, Miller fires a shot. Although Traver splashes into the water, he emerges unscathed out of Miller's view. That night, Miller presents Evvie with a new dress and some high heel shoes. He tries to kiss her, but she pulls away, and he sees the twenty-dollar bill pinned to the inside of Evvie's old dress. Miller angrily demands to know what Evvie gave Traver in exchange for so much money, not believing the truth. After Evvie goes to bed, Traver bursts in with the shotgun to get his motor, which Miller had taken, and Miller's rifle. He explains he is not a thief because he paid for the supplies he took, inadvertently corroborating Evvie's story. In the morning, Miller gives Evvie the money back. She goes to see Traver, who is fixing his boat, but their conversation is interrupted when Miller shows up. The tension is defused somewhat when the men discover they were both in the army and took part in the liberation of Italy during WWII. Later, Traver comes to the cabins to keep an eye on Miller while his boat soaks overnight. Evvie gets Traver to play his clarinet, and she dances until Miller gets a hand grenade and throws it. He says he has two more, so Traver does not have the upper hand, even with the guns, and should just give them back, which Traver does that evening. Miller moves Evvie into his cabin so Traver can stay in hers, and, while Traver plays the clarinet, Miller rapes Evvie. There is a rainstorm the following day, and, to interrupt a fraught racial conversation, Evvie asks Traver to play some music. When he goes to get his clarinet, Jackson arrives unexpectedly with Reverend Fleetwood, who has come to perform a funeral service and take Evvie to a children's home. Jackson mentions that a black musician raped a white woman, and Miller realizes why Traver is on the island. Traver snuck away when the visitors came, so Miller and Jackson do not find him in Evvie's cabin, and they decide to wait until morning to continue their search, as it is still raining and Jackson has the keys to his boat and Miller has Traver's motor and oars. While Miller and Jackson hunt Traver, the Reverend, who has suspicions about Miller's treatment of Evvie, baptizes Evvie, though she fails to see the value of the ritual. Evvie and the Reverend find Traver stuck in one of Miller's animal traps and bring him to the cabins to address his wounded leg. Traver declares his innocence and the Reverend believes him after he says who made the claim against him, as the woman is a drunk and falsely accused a white man of raping her two years ago. Miller and Jackson return and tie Traver up, planning to take him to the mainland the next day. The Reverend says he will testify on Traver's behalf, but Traver says he does not expect to live long enough to see his trial. After dark, Traver convinces Evvie to set him free. The Reverend confronts Miller about Evvie and Miller confirms the rape, though he defends his actions and asks the Reverend not to report him. After Jackson, who is an even bigger racist than Miller, leaves to find and kill Traver in the morning, the Reverend appeals to Miller, ending by pointing out what a hypocrite he is being. Miller asks if the Reverend would still turn him in if he married Evvie, and the Reverend says he would have to ask his superiors. Miller finds Jackson, takes his gun, and tells him to get off the island. Traver, who slept in a shed, limps up to Evvie and the Reverend just as Miller returns to the cabins. To everyone's surprise, Miller gives Traver his oars to use as crutches and offers to carry his motor to his boat so he can leave. Evvie goes with the Reverend, but Miller says he will visit her in town soon. Jackson intercepts Traver and attacks him with a knife. Traver defends himself with an oar and gets the knife, but he is able to stop himself from killing Jackson. Evvie and the Reverend leave with Jackson and Miller helps Traver launch his boat, leaving Miller alone on the island.",

    "Synopsis": "In Salford, 17-year-old Josephine (who goes by \"Jo\"), struggles through an outdoor game of netball in gym class at her all-girls school. When she gets home, she hears her self-centred mother, Helen, arguing with their landlady, who is upset about overdue rent and Helen's frequent gentlemen visitors. Once the landlady leaves, Jo and Helen sneak out the window and move across town on a bus, which is apparently not a unique occurrence for the pair. When Jo and Helen arrive at their shabby new flat, Jimmy, a young black sailor, sees Jo struggling with her suitcases and comes to her aid. Later that evening, Helen brings her new boyfriend, Peter, home after a night in the pub, but Peter leaves after realizing that Helen is a mother. Helen and Jo go to sleep in the bed they share. After being kept after class for mocking her teacher, Jo trips and scrapes her knee as she is walking home. She limps past the Manchester Ship Canal, where Jimmy happens to be disembarking the ship on which he works as a cook. He invites her aboard to attend to her knee. They begin a brief courtship, and Jimmy gives Jo an engagement ring that she wears on a ribbon around her neck. Jo joins Helen and Peter on a weekend trip to Blackpool with friends. Peter gives Helen an ultimatum, saying she must choose between him and her daughter; Helen sends Jo home alone. Jimmy is waiting when Jo arrives in Salford, and they spend the night together. In the morning, Jo watches him board his ship and depart. Helen returns just long enough to pack before leaving to get married and go on a honeymoon, after which she intends to live in a suburban bungalow with Peter. Left to fend for herself, Jo leaves school, gets a job in a shoe shop, and moves into a loft apartment in a former workshop. She meets Geoffrey Ingham, a gay textile design student, and invites him to live with her after learning he has been evicted due to his sexuality. Jo discovers she is pregnant by Jimmy.

After Jo has an outburst during which she says she does not want to be either a mother or a woman, Geoff tracks down Helen. Helen comes to visit Jo, and they almost immediately have a row. An inebriated Peter enters, takes back some money Helen offered Jo, and states that Jo will not be allowed to move into his house.

    "Synopsis": "The president nominates Robert A. Leffingwell as Secretary of State. The second-term president, who is ill, has chosen him in part because he does not believe that Vice President Harley Hudson, whom both he and others usually ignore, will successfully continue the administration's foreign policy should the president die. Leffingwell's nomination is controversial within the Senate, which must use its advice and consent powers to approve or reject the appointment. The parties of both the president and the minority are divided. Senate Majority Leader Bob Munson, the senior senator from Michigan, loyally supports the nominee despite his doubts, as do the hard-working majority whip Stanley Danta of Connecticut and womanizer Lafe Smith of Rhode Island. Demagogic peace advocate Fred Van Ackerman of Wyoming is especially supportive, but Munson repeatedly advises him not to aggravate the situation. Although also of the majority party, the curmudgeonly president pro tempore Seabright \"Seab\" Cooley of South Carolina dislikes Leffingwell for both personal and professional reasons and leads the opposition. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee appoints a subcommittee, chaired by majority member Brigham Anderson of Utah, to evaluate the nominee. The young and devoted family man is undecided on Leffingwell. Cooley dramatically introduces a surprise witness, Herbert Gelman, during the subcommittee's hearing. The minor Treasury Department clerk testifies that he was briefly affiliated with a communist cell with Leffingwell and two others at the University of Chicago. Leffingwell denies the charge and questions Gelman's credibility but later tells the president that he had committed perjury and that Gelman was telling the truth. He asks the president to withdraw his nomination, but the president refuses. Cooley identifies another member of the cell, senior Treasury official Hardiman Fletcher. He forces Fletcher to confess to Anderson, who tells Munson. Despite personal lobbying by the president, the subcommittee chairman insists that the White House withdraw the nomination because of Leffingwell's perjury or he will subpoena Fletcher to testify. The president angrily refuses, but the majority leader admits that the White House will soon have to nominate another candidate. Anderson delays his committee's report on Leffingwell, but the president sends Fletcher out of the country, angering the senator. Anderson's wife receives anonymous phone calls from a man warning that unless the subcommittee reports favorably on Leffingwell, information about what happened with \"Ray\" in Hawaii will be disclosed. A worried Anderson visits fellow army veteran Ray Schaff in New York. Schaff admits that he sold evidence of a past homosexual relationship between the two. Vice President Hudson and Anderson's friend Smith join others in attempting to counsel the troubled chairman, but unable to reconcile his duty and his secret, Anderson takes his own life. The president denies knowing about the blackmail to Munson and Hudson. He tells the majority leader that he is dying and that Leffingwell's confirmation is vital. Munson criticizes Cooley for opposing the nominee but not exposing Fletcher and thus forcing Anderson to bear the pressure alone. Anderson's death nonetheless permits the subcommittee and the Foreign Relations Committee to proceed with the nomination. Both report favorably to the full Senate. thumb|right|Sen. Seabright Cooley (Charles Laughton) speaking against the Leffingwell nomination on the Senate floor In the Senate Chamber, Cooley apologizes for his \"vindictiveness\". While he will vote against Leffingwell and his \"alien voice\", Cooley will not ask others to follow. Munson, moved by Cooley's action, cites the \"tragic circumstances\" surrounding the confirmation. The majority leader will vote for Leffingwell but will permit a conscience vote from others. Hudson's quorum call and the majority leader's refusal to yield the floor prevent Van Ackerman from speaking until Munson asks for the \"yeas and nays\", ending debate. Munson tells Van Ackerman that if not for the Andersons' privacy, the Senate would have expelled him, as he was responsible for the blackmail. Van Ackerman leaves the chamber before the vote. Munson's side is slightly ahead until Smith unexpectedly votes against Leffingwell, and the majority leader prepares for the vice president to break the tie in the nominee's favor. Secret Service agents enter the chamber, and Hudson receives a message from the Senate chaplain. He announces that he will not break the tie, thus causing the nomination to fail, and that the president has died during the vote. As he leaves with the Secret Service, Hudson tells Munson that he wants to choose his own secretary of state. The film ends as Munson moves to adjourn because of the former president's death.",

    "Synopsis": "Berry-Berry Willart is a hedonistic drifter in his 20s who has no trouble living off the women of all ages he seduces. When the women become too attached to him, his charm turns sadistic and frequently lands him in jail for battery. Berry-Berry is always on the road far from home, rarely seen by his drunken father Ralph, his mother Annabel, or his sixteen-year-old brother Clinton. Clinton idolizes Berry-Berry, despite having to bail him out of jail in Florida, and later accompany Ralph to Western Union to wire bail money when Berry-Berry is arrested a second time for beating up a woman. Remarks by Ralph indicate this is not the first time he has wired bail money for Berry-Berry. Clinton is infatuated with Echo O'Brien, the 31-year-old daughter of a family friend who stays with them when she visits town. Echo has never married, and is getting over the suicide of her troubled long-time boyfriend over a year before. She is friendly toward the much younger Clinton, referring to him affectionately as \"my guy\". But when she meets Berry-Berry, there is an instant mutual attraction between them, and they leave a family backyard cookout that evening to be alone together. Berry-Berry asks Clinton for permission to be with Echo, saying that he wants her and she wants him, but acknowledging that Clinton saw her first. He says he will back off if Clinton does not give the okay. Clinton, knowing he has no real chance with Echo, tells Berry-Berry to treat her nice. After this, Berry-Berry and Echo are constantly in each other's company. When they return home after an evening out some time later, Berry-Berry finds out that Echo is pregnant. She tells him that she does not expect anything from him, that she took a gamble that someday he would love her, not that he would marry her, and she lost. As she tells him he is free, he runs out of the house and drives off in the rain, leaving her in tears. Clinton, who makes a habit of eavesdropping, witnesses the whole exchange. Echo decides she must leave the Willarts' house. She assures Clinton, who is concerned about the rain and the late hour, that she loves driving at night. But the Willarts are awakened later by a call from a state trooper, reporting that Echo had driven off the road and been killed in the ensuing crash. Ralph tells Annabel and Clinton that Echo was too good a driver for her crash to have been an accident, and that Berry-Berry must have had something to do with it. Clinton throws Berry-Berry's framed portrait to the floor and stomps on it. Annabel pushes him away, picks up the portrait and holds it closely, shrieking that she does not care what Berry-Berry's done, she will love him always. Clinton sneaks into the shack where Berry-Berry has been living, retrieves the pistol his brother had shown him during a previous visit, and waits behind a curtain for Berry-Berry to return. When he does return, Berry-Berry collapses sobbing onto the bed, having found out about Echo. Clinton puts the pistol back where he found it and leaves, seeing the brother he once wanted to emulate as someone to be pitied.",

    "film_title": "Cléo from 5 to 7",
    "Synopsis": "In Paris, singer Cléopâtre \"Cléo\" Victoire is at a tarot card reading. The fortune teller says there is illness and change in her future, as well as a meeting with a talkative young man, but insists that the Death card just indicates a profound transformation, and not necessarily literal death. When the woman acts as though she cannot read palms after looking at Cléo's hand, however, Cléo becomes distraught, taking the reading as confirmation that the results of her biopsy will come back positive for stomach cancer that evening. Cléo walks to a café, where her assistant, Angèle, is waiting for her. Angèle fails to calm her down, and she attracts the attention of the owner, who gives her a free coffee after hearing her troubles. The two women go hat shopping, and Cléo buys a black fur hat, despite Angèle telling her that it is unsuitable for summer weather. When Cléo wants to wear the hat out, Angèle reminds her that it is bad luck to wear—or even carry—something new on a Tuesday, so they have the shopkeeper send the hat to Cléo, and get in a taxi. One of Cléo's songs plays on the radio, and Cléo and Angèle talk with the female driver about the dangers of her job and listen to news coverage of the Algerian War. At Cléo's flat, Angèle gets her a hot water bottle for her stomach. Cléo's lover, a busy older businessman named José, drops by, and, though he talks lovingly to Cléo, he dismisses her fears when she mentions them and only stays a few minutes. Cléo tells Angèle that she is thinking about breaking up with José, and they discuss men. Bob, a composer and pianist, and Maurice, a lyricist, arrive to rehearse with Cléo. When Angèle mentions that Cléo is ill, the men try to cheer her up by pretending to be doctors, but only half-succeed. Some lighthearted new songs do lift Cléo's spirits for a bit, but a dramatic ballad titled \"Sans toi\" makes her agitated again. She changes into a black dress, and, saying she wants to be alone, leaves. Wandering to Le Dôme Café, Cléo plays one of her songs on the jukebox, but no one pays it any attention. She goes to an art studio to visit her old friend Dorothée, who is modelling nude for a class of sculptors. When the class finishes, Cléo goes with Dorothée to pick up a package for her boyfriend Raoul, and they bring it to the cinema where he works as a projectionist. Dorothée is worried to hear about Cléo's health concerns, but, though she is sympathetic, she does not have much productive advice. Raoul invites Cléo and Dorothée to stay for the short film when Dorothée mentions that Cléo is ill, saying that a laugh is good for any illness. From the projection booth, they watch a brief silent comedy in which a man thinks he sees his fiancée die and get carted off in a hearse, only to realise his sunglasses were making things look black, and the scene repeats in a much lighter tone. Leaving the cinema, Dorothée drops her purse and breaks a hand mirror, which Cléo considers a bad omen. There is a crowd outside Le Dôme, and Cléo and Dorothée learn a man has been killed there. They get in a taxi, and Dorothée tells Cléo that the broken mirror was for the man, not her. Cléo drops Dorothée off at another modelling job, and, as it is a beautiful day, goes to the nearby Parc Montsouris. By the waterfall, Antoine, a gentle soldier on the last day of his leave from the Algerian War who is full of facts, approaches Cléo, telling her that it is the longest day of the year. They bond over their mutual fear of dying, and Antoine encourages Cléo to go to the hospital to get her results in person, rather than call, saying he will accompany her, and she can see him off at the train station afterward. On the way to a bus stop, Cléo tells Antoine that her real name is Florence, which he says he prefers. Antoine initially is able to distract Cléo with his conversation, but she becomes more pensive as they near the hospital. She is upset when told that her doctor has already left for the day, but calms down as she and Antoine walk in the hospital's garden. They sit on a bench and discuss where they should eat before Antoine's train, when, suddenly, Cléo's doctor drives by and stops. He casually tells Cléo that she will be alright after two months of chemotherapy, and to come see him in the morning. Antoine says he is sorry he has to leave, as he would like to be with Cléo, and she responds that he is with her at this moment, and that she thinks her fear is gone and she is happy. Cléo and Antoine walk on in silence, occasionally glancing at each other, and then stop and stare into each other's eyes.",

    "film_title": "Devi (1960 film)",
    "Synopsis": "In rural Bengal in the 19th-century, the widowed zamindar Kalikinkar Roy, who is a devotee of the goddess Kali, lives in a mansion with servants and plenty of space for himself, his sons Taraprasad and Umaprasad, Taraprasad's wife Harasundari and son Khoka, and Umaprasad's wife Doyamoyee. After a festival, Umaprasad returns to Calcutta (Kolkata) to continue his schooling, which includes learning English, while Doyamoyee stays behind to help care for Khoka, with whom she has an almost-maternal bond, as well as Kalikinkar, who she helps with his daily prayers and rituals. Kalikinkar has a dream in which the eyes of Kali and Doyamoyee merge, which he interprets as revealing that Doyamoyee is an incarnation of the goddess. He wakes her up and falls at her feet, and the passive Taraprasad follows suit, though Harasundari remains skeptical. The family priest is called and performs a ritual with smoke and bells. Doyamoyee faints, which Kalikinkar interprets as her going into a trance. When she wakes up, she asks Harasundari to write to Umaprasad. Doyamoyee is moved to a more private part of the mansion and made to sit as an idol around which regular worship rituals are performed. A local beggar, having tried everything else he could think of, brings his unconscious grandson to her, and Kalikinkar suggests giving the boy some charanamrito (the water used to wash the goddess's feet) to drink. Umaprasad arrives during this process and, shocked by the whole scene, privately argues with his father. Kalikinkar questions his certainty briefly, but, when the sick boy opens his eyes, he feels it is proof of Doyamoyee's divinity. That night, Umaprasad sneaks into Doyamoyee's room and asks her to leave with him. They make it to the riverbank, where there is a boat waiting, but Doyamoyee hesitates and becomes anxious. She has begun to wonder if maybe she is a goddess, and, afraid to leave, asks Umaprasad to take her home. Reluctantly, he complies and returns to Calcutta alone. As word spreads about the \"miracle\" with the sick boy, Doyamoyee's following grows rapidly, and supplicants travel from afar to worship her. She sits stoically during the ceremonies, but her feelings of isolation grow. Even Khoka begins to avoid her. One day, Khoka develops a high fever. Harasundari calls a doctor, and, though he is uncomfortable being there without Kalikinkar's knowledge, he agrees to return with some medicine. However, Taraprasad enters as the doctor is leaving, and he tells Kalikinkar what is going on. Kalikinkar brings Khoka to Doyamee and asks her to heal the boy, and, although Harasundari and Doyamoyee both have serious doubts that it is a good idea, they agree to go along with the plan to give Khoka some charanamrito and let Doyamoyee hold him that night. Khoka is dead in the morning. Umaprasad returns home and finds Kalikinkar alone, weeping at the foot of a statue of Kali. He accuses his father of killing Khoka through his blind faith, and then says he intends to save his wife from the crushing burden of divinity, but he seems to be too late—he finds Doyamoyee getting dressed in her wedding attire, wide-eyed and saying they must leave before she is killed. She runs off into the mist, while Umaprasad calls after her.",

    "Synopsis": "Ferdinando Cefalù, a 37-year-old impoverished Sicilian nobleman, is married to Rosalia, a devoted wife he no longer loves. He is in love with his cousin Angela, a 16-year-old girl he sees only during the summer because her family sends her away to Catholic school in the city. Besides his wife, he shares his life with his elderly parents, his sister, and her fiancé, a funeral director. The family share their once stately palace with his uncles, who are slowly but surely eating away the remainders of their once rich estate. Aware that divorce is illegal, Ferdinando fantasizes about doing away with his wife, such as by throwing her into a boiling cauldron, sending her into space in a rocket, or drowning her in quicksand. After a chance encounter with Angela during a family trip, he discovers that she shares his feelings. Inspired by a local story of a woman who killed her husband in a rage of jealousy, he resolves to lead his wife into having an affair so that he can catch her in flagrante delicto, murder her, and receive a light sentence for committing an honour killing. He first needs to find a suitable lover for his wife, whom he finds in the local priest's godson, Carmelo Patanè, a painter who has had feelings for Rosalia for years. For a time he was presumed killed during World War II. Ferdinando also procures the State Prosecutor's friendship with a small favor. The final stage of his plan is to arrange for Carmelo's constant presence in his house, which he achieves by feigning interest in having his palace frescoes restored. But Carmelo is timid with Rosalia, and she is initially committed to conjugal fidelity. Ferdinando tapes their private conversations and has to ward off the maid Sisina's infatuation with Carmelo. After Carmelo makes a pass at Sisina, she tells the priest, Carmelo's godfather, at confession, who informs her that Carmelo is married with three children. She relays that information to Ferdinando. Rosalia and Carmelo finally give in to their passion, but the tape of their conversation runs out just as they are arranging their next meeting. All Ferdinando knows is that it will take place the next evening. Rosalia feigns a headache and remains home while the rest of the family goes to the cinema to see the local première of La Dolce Vita, a film so scandalous that no one wants to miss it. Ferdinando sneaks out of the theater and returns home, arriving just in time to see Rosalia leaving for the train station. He retrieves his gun to kill her, but arrives at the station just after their train departs. He revisits his plan and the Criminal Code. It defines a crime of passion as executed in the heat of the moment or in defense of one's honor, so he embraces the role of a cuckold. All along, Angela has been writing Ferdinando to assure him of her undying love for him. Her last letter is misdelivered to her father, who dies of a heart attack upon reading it. At the funeral, Ferdinando is approached by Mrs. Patanè, who demands to know what he will do about their situation. After he responds noncommittally, she spits in his face in front of the entire town, which gives him what he needs: an open insult to the family's honor due to his wife's elopement. The local Mafia boss offers to find the lovers within 24 hours, which he does. As Ferdinando goes to the lovers' hideout, he hears Mrs. Patanè kill Carmelo. He follows suit and kills Rosalia. At his trial he is defended by the State Prosecutor, who blames the whole thing on Ferdinando's father, saying that he failed to give his son enough love when raising him as a boy. Ferdinando is released from prison after three years and returns home to find Angela waiting for him. Later, Ferdinando and Angela are happily sailing at sea. As they kiss, Angela seductively rubs her feet against those of the young workman piloting the boat.",

    "Synopsis": "Kawaguchi in Saitama Prefecture is a city where many cupolas of foundries stand side by side. Jun is the eldest child of Tatsugoro ISHIGURO, a foundry worker at a local factory, and is a senior at junior high school, aiming to go on to full-time high school. Tatsugoro is unable to work satisfactorily due to the aftereffects of a serious injury sustained at work, and when the company he works for is acquired by a competitor, he becomes a target for layoff. The Ishiguro family falls in dire straits, with their eldest son Takayuki, who is in sixth grade at elementary school, their second son Tetsuharu, who is not yet in school, and a newborn baby boy. Katsumi, a young man who is a neighbor and former colleague of Tatsugoro, feels sorry for the Ishiguro family and negotiates with the president of the new company through the labor union, succeeding in getting the equivalent of several months' worth of injury and sickness benefits paid, but Tatsugoro, ashamed of having been \"indebted to the Reds,\" spends all the money on alcohol and motorcycle racing. In order to earn money for living expenses and tuition for her desired full-time high school, Jun starts working part-time at a pachinko parlor where her classmate Yoshie works. Tatsugoro's wife Tomi, the mother of Jun and her siblings, also stops working at a home job and starts working at a pub. Takayuki comes up with the idea of collecting wild pigeon eggs, training them as carrier pigeons, and selling them, but it doesn't work out well because the chicks are eaten by cats. In the junior high school class about to go on a school trip, students are asking their teachers to raise the amount of cash they can carry as pocket money due to rising prices, and a vote is held at a class meeting. Noda, the homeroom teacher who is present, is concerned about Jun, who does not actively support the idea. Noda follows Jun on her way home from school and sees her enter a pachinko parlor. At that moment, Katsumi, a former student of Noda, appears and explains Jun's situation. The next day, Noda tells Jun that the city's Board of Education is subsidizing school trip expenses for poor students, and hands her the money from the Board. Tatsugoro gets a job at a new foundry through the introduction by Jun's classmate Nobuko's father, Tougo, but there is no place for an old craftsman who relies on intuition and experience in an automated factory, so he quits without telling his family. Tatsugoro reveals this on the morning of Jun's departure for the school trip, causing his family to panic. Jun, in order not to see Nobuko, does not go to the meeting place at Kawaguchi Station, but kills time on the riverbank (there is a scene that makes viewers infer she has her first period), and takes a local train to Urawa where her desired school is. Peeking into the high school ground through the fence, Jun is disillusioned when she sees the physical education class that looks like a childish dance. Meanwhile, Takayuki, who has also skipped school and come to Urawa, sets free a pigeon he has raised there and succeeds in returning it to its cage at home. Jun, who returned to Kawaguchi, happened to look into the pub where Tomi works and was shocked to see Tomi flirting with male patrons. There, Jun meets a female student who has dropped out of school, nicknamed \"Squirrel,\" and is invited to a bar, where she drinks alcohol for the first time in her life. There, she is nearly molested by some delinquent boys, but narrowly escapes. Since that day, Jun stops going to school. Worried about Jun, Noda visits the Ishiguro family. Jun spits out, \"There's no point in studying,\" but Noda advises her, \"Studying for exams isn't the only way to study. Even if you don't go to high school and work, you have to study so that you can always have your own opinion, by building up an understanding of what's happening in front of you.\" Jun resumes attending school and goes on a field trip to a factory of Hitachi, a major electronics manufacturer. Seeing the female factory workers who work while studying at a part-time high school at night and are also active in club activities such as chorus, Jun sees the independent image of modern workers and begins to admire them. One day, Yoshie's family decides to leave their Japanese mother behind and return to North Korea as part of a major program to repatriate Koreans living in Japan. Yoshie's younger brother and Takayuki's best friend Sankichi is also leaving Japan, and Takayuki comes to Kawaguchi Station to see him off. He gives him a bag full of marbles as a farewell gift, as well as a carrier pigeon he has raised, and asks Sankichi to attach a letter and release the pigeon from the train window at Nishi-Kawaguchi Station. Yoshie, on her part, gives her favorite bicycle to Jun, who also came to the station. The group stays in Ueno, Tokyo that night, and plans to head to Niigata Port, where the repatriation ship departs, the next day. The next day, the train to Niigata passes Nishi-Kawaguchi Station, and Sankichi releases the pigeon. Seeing the pigeon flying back to Kawaguchi, Sankichi longs for his mother and gets off the train at Omiya Station. However, when Sankichi returns to Kawaguchi, his mother has closed the diner she was running and disappeared to marry someone else. Takayuki leaves Sankichi with the family of Choi who lives nearby until the next return ship departs in the new year, and the two start working part-time delivering newspapers, vowing to \"stop relying on others.\" Suddenly, Tatsugoro is reinstated to his former workplace. Katsumi comes over and offers them a celebration drink, during which Jun reveals her intention to take a job at Hitachi, a company she had visited. On the morning Sankichi leaves for Niigata, Jun and Takayuki see him off on the train from the Kawaguchi Overpass. That day is also the day of Jun's job interview. The siblings run energetically through the city to Kawaguchi Station.",

    "film_title": "Keeper of Promises",
    "Synopsis": "\nThe film revolves around Zé do Burro (Zé of the Donkey), a poor peasant who embarks on a deeply spiritual and physical journey to fulfill a sacred promise, or vow (promessa), that he made to the gods. Zé, a simple man with strong religious faith, made this promise under desperate circumstances in the hope of saving his beloved donkey.\n\nBackground: The Promise\nZé and his wife, Rosa, live in the rural countryside. Zé's donkey, a vital part of his livelihood, becomes seriously ill. Fearing the loss of the animal that is crucial to his work, Zé, despite being a devout Catholic, makes a syncretic vow at a terreiro (a place of Afro-Brazilian religious worship), promising to Saint Barbara—who, in syncretic Afro-Brazilian religions like Candomblé, is also associated with the African deity Iansã—that if his donkey recovers, he will carry a large wooden cross from his home to the Church of Saint Barbara in Salvador, Bahia.\n\nMiraculously, the donkey survives, and Zé, feeling bound by his vow, embarks on his long pilgrimage, carrying a heavy cross over his shoulders like Jesus. His wife Rosa reluctantly joins him, even though she doesn’t fully believe in his quest. Zé’s promise, rooted in sincere devotion, is about fulfilling what he believes is his obligation to Saint Barbara.\n\nArrival at the Church\nZé finally arrives in Salvador with his cross, exhausted but determined. He heads to the Church of Saint Barbara to fulfill his vow by placing the cross in front of the altar, expecting a simple gesture of thanks and devotion. However, his plans take an unexpected turn when he meets Father Olavo, the parish priest of the church.\n\nFather Olavo immediately takes issue with Zé's vow, refusing him entry to the church. The priest is suspicious of the fact that Zé made his vow at a Candomblé terreiro rather than within a strictly Catholic setting. From the priest’s perspective, Zé's promise mixes pagan and Catholic beliefs, which Olavo views as blasphemous. The church represents the institutional rigidity of the Catholic hierarchy, which refuses to accommodate or recognize Zé’s syncretic faith.\n\nConflict and Tensions\nZé is bewildered and devastated by the priest's refusal. He cannot understand why his sincere vow, made in desperation and faith, is being rejected by the very church dedicated to the saint he wishes to honor. As he persists in trying to fulfill his promise, Zé becomes a figure of public curiosity and controversy. The once personal and humble act of devotion begins to spiral out of control, attracting attention from different quarters.\n\nRosa becomes increasingly frustrated by Zé's obsession with fulfilling the promise, as she feels he is being humiliated. She also catches the attention of a local pimp named Bonitão, who tries to seduce her, adding tension to her relationship with Zé.\nThe local media sensationalizes the story, portraying Zé as either a saintly figure or a foolish fanatic, depending on the perspective.\nPolitical and social activists see Zé as a potential martyr or symbol of resistance against the powerful Catholic Church and institutional authority. They try to manipulate his story to serve their own causes, turning Zé into an unwitting symbol for social protest.\nThe churchyard becomes the stage for a gathering of various factions, and Zé’s personal act of faith transforms into a public spectacle. The crowds grow larger as people debate whether Zé should be allowed to enter the church. Some see him as a true man of faith, while others mock him as naïve.\n\nZé’s Growing Desperation\nAs time passes and Zé remains in front of the church, holding his cross and begging to be allowed inside, his physical and mental state deteriorates. His devotion to his promise turns into an all-consuming obsession. The tension between his humble piety and the institutional inflexibility of the church grows more tragic as Zé becomes increasingly isolated.\n\nZé is not interested in politics or social causes—he is simply a man trying to do what he believes is right by fulfilling his promise to God. Yet, he finds himself caught in a complex web of social, religious, and political conflicts that he cannot control or understand.\n\nThe Tragic Climax\nDespite his determination, Zé’s plea is never accepted by the church. Father Olavo remains adamant in his refusal, and Zé, now desperate, tries to force his way into the church. His once-peaceful mission culminates in a dramatic and violent confrontation.\n\nIn a tragic twist, as Zé attempts to storm the church with his cross, he is shot and killed by the police. The peaceful, devout man, who only wanted to keep his promise, dies in the chaos created by a rigid system that could not accommodate his faith or understand the depth of his devotion.\n\nConclusion\nZé’s death sends shockwaves through the crowd, and his body is taken into the church—finally entering the place he had longed to reach, but only in death. The film ends on a deeply somber note, reflecting the bitter irony of Zé’s journey: the man who was barred from the church in life is carried into it as a martyr in death.\n\n",

    "Synopsis": "On a Monday morning in July 1961, Vittoria, a young literary translator, ends her relationship with Riccardo in his apartment in the EUR residential district of Rome, following a long night of conversation. Riccardo tries to persuade her to stay, but she tells him she no longer loves him and leaves. As she wanders the deserted streets, Riccardo catches up and walks with her through a wooded area to her apartment building, where they say their final goodbyes. Vittoria visits her mother at the frantic Rome Stock Exchange. A young stockbroker, Piero, overhears an inside tip, rushes to purchase the stocks, and then sells them at a large profit. He introduces himself to Vittoria; he is her mother's stockbroker. Outside the building, Vittoria attempts to tell her mother about her recent breakup, but her mother is preoccupied with her earned profits. That evening, Vittoria's neighbor Anita comes to visit and they discuss the former's breakup. Another neighbor, Marta, calls and invites them to her apartment nearby. A white colonialist from Kenya, Marta refers to the natives as \"monkeys\" and believes they are threatening the white minorities. Vittoria dons blackface and mimics an African tribal dance until Marta, unamused, asks her to stop. When Marta's dog Zeus escapes from the apartment, the women chase after him. Later, Riccardo calls for Vittoria outside her apartment, but she hides and does not answer. The next day, Vittoria accompanies Anita and her husband on a trip to Verona. Meanwhile, back at the Rome Stock Exchange, Piero is busy making trades. Vittoria arrives at the Stock Exchange and learns that her mother has lost approximately 10 million lire due to a stock market crash. She encounters Piero, who drives her to her mother's apartment in his Alfa Romeo Giulietta sports car. She shows him framed family pictures and her room growing up. Piero tries to kiss her, but she refuses. Piero drives back to his office, where he must break the bad news to his investors. After work, Piero meets with a call girl he previously arranged to meet, but sends her away upon finding that she has dyed her blonde hair a darker color. He then drives to Vittoria's building and stands outside her apartment. Vittoria comes out to her balcony, and while they are talking, a drunk man steals Piero's sports car. The next morning, Vittoria and Piero meet by a lake and watch as a crane lifts the car with the drunk man's dead body out of the water. After a long walk, they arrive at a building under construction near Vittoria's apartment building. Piero again tries to kiss her, but she pulls away and heads home. That evening, Vittoria calls Piero but says nothing; thinking it is a prank call, he yells into the phone and slams down the receiver. The next day, while Vittoria is waiting by the construction site, Piero arrives and tells her he has bought a new BMW to replace his Alfa Romeo. He takes her to his parents' apartment, which is filled with paintings and sculptures. As they talk, she seems nervous and unwilling to open up to him. They eventually kiss, and after he accidentally tears her dress, she goes into a bedroom and looks at his old family pictures. Piero comes to the bedroom, and they have sex. Vittoria and Piero are lying on a hill. When he brings up marriage, she asserts that she does not miss it, even though she has never been married. He then grows frustrated with her inability to express how she feels about him, to which she responds, \"I wish I didn't love you or that I loved you much more.\" Some time later at his office, Vittoria and Piero are making out and frolicking on a couch. When an alarm goes off, they prepare to part. They embrace and discuss seeing each other every day. They agree to meet that evening at 8 pm at the \"usual place\" outside the construction site, and Vittoria leaves. That evening, on Sunday, 10 September 1961, neither shows up at the designated meeting place.",

    "Synopsis": "In a small provincial town, a group of \"pious\" women is fond of ostentatiously practicing charity. They organize a Christmas campaign under the motto \"Feed a poor man at your table.\" In order to support the initiative, the sponsorship of a pot brand is sought, and a group of second-rate artists is invited. The artists have come expressly from the capital and are received enthusiastically at the train station. The humanitarian day is completed with a colorful parade, a public auction of the guests, and a dramatic radio broadcast. The person in charge of organizing this lavish chain of events is Quintanilla, who has hired Plácido for the occasion, a poor man who must utilize the motorcycle car that he has just acquired and has not yet begun to pay for. The hectic activity in which Plácido is involved prevents him from paying the first payment on the vehicle on time, which expires that same night. From that moment, Placido tries by all means to find a solution to his problem because his vehicle is what he uses to earn a living. However, he is taken from one place to another, involved in a series of unexpected incidents, including a comedy of errors involving an elderly beggar with heart problems. The film is a race against time to get the money paid before the deadline expires. Berlanga's social satire pokes fun at rich people trying to soothe their consciences by helping a poor person for one day. Along the way, we see their disgust at being near the poor, debates over whether it's better to choose a street person or an elderly poor person, and showing off \"their\" poor person to their friends as though they were a possession. Berlanga also pokes fun at actors more concerned about photo ops appearing to show them as charitable than actually being charitable.",

    "Synopsis": "After a night at the opera, Edmundo and Lucía Nóbile host eighteen wealthy acquaintances at a dinner party at their mansion. The servants inexplicably begin to leave as the guests are about to arrive; by the time the meal is over, only Julio, the majordomo, is left. Lucía cancels a planned surprise involving a bear and three sheep upon discovering that guest Sergio Russell does not like jokes, but there are a few strange occurrences, such as the guests somehow entering the mansion and going upstairs twice, Edmundo repeating his toast to the opera singer Silvia, and Cristián Ugalde and Leandro Gomez greeting each other three times (as strangers, cordially, and antagonistically). The guests mingle before adjourning to the salon to listen to Blanca play a Paradisi keyboard sonata. When she finishes, she says she is tired, and several other guests indicate they are about to go home, but no one does. Instead, without discussing it, the guests and hosts settle in and spend the night in the salon, preventing Lucía from sneaking off for a tryst with Colonel Alvaro Aranda. In the morning, it is discovered that Sergio is unconscious. The hosts and some of the guests wonder why no one attempted to leave the night before. A few guests try to exit the salon, but they all turn back or become distressed and stop before crossing the threshold. When Julio brings some leftovers for breakfast, he is trapped as well. thumb|left|Patricia Morán and [[Ofelia Montesco in a publicity still for the film]] By that evening, everyone is on edge. They are using a closet as a toilet and have run out of clean water. Raúl blames Eduardo for their plight, but Leticia defends the host. Sergio dies during the night, and Dr. Carlos Conde and Alvaro hide the corpse in a closet. A crowd of onlookers, police, and soldiers gathers outside the gates of the mansion over the following days; no one is able to enter, although there is no physical barrier. The trapped individuals get water by tapping into a pipe in the wall, but their good manners continue to deteriorate. A growing number of them become ill, and Dr. Conde has no medicine until Edmundo shows him a stash of opiates, which some of the guests sneak for themselves. At a particularly heated moment, the trapped group sees the three sheep and bear roaming the mansion. The sheep wander into the salon, where they are caught and roasted on a fire in the middle of the room. Eduardo and Beatriz, a young engaged couple, kill themselves in a closet. One night, all of the Nóbiles' servants are drawn back to the mansion. Inside, Raúl has convinced most of the other guests that their predicament will end if Edmundo dies. Dr. Conde attempts to reason with them, and a fight breaks out, the doctor assisted by Alvaro and Julio. Edmundo and Leticia come out of the curtained-off area they have begun to inhabit, and Edmundo offers to take his own life. He produces a small pistol he had hidden, but Leticia tells him to wait. She notices that all of the people and furniture are in the same spot as the night of the party, and has Blanca play the end of the piano sonata and everyone repeat the conversation that followed. This time, when Blanca says she is tired, the group can leave the salon and then the mansion. The members of the small crowd outside see them exit and are able to pass through the gates to greet them. To give thanks for their salvation, most of the group from the salon attend a Te Deum service. Afterwards, neither the clergy nor the churchgoers can leave the cathedral. The military fires on a group of people waiting in front of the cathedral while a flock of sheep enters the building.",

    "Synopsis": "Miss Giddens applies for her first job as a governess. The wealthy bachelor uncle who interviews her is unconcerned with her lack of experience. He values his freedom to travel and socialise and unabashedly confesses that he has \"no room, mentally or emotionally\" for his niece and nephew. They were orphaned and left in his care as infants, and he keeps them at Bly, his large country estate. The previous governess, Mary Jessel, died suddenly less than a year earlier. All he cares about is that Miss Giddens accept full responsibility for the children, never troubling him with whatever problems may arise. At Bly, Miss Giddens is instantly taken with Flora, the niece. She also forges a friendship with Mrs Grose, the kindly housekeeper. The boy, Miles, is away at boarding school, but soon returns to Bly after being expelled from school for being a \"bad influence\" on his peers. Mrs Grose says she cannot imagine Miles misbehaving, and when Miss Giddens meets the boy herself, she too thinks his teachers must have exaggerated. He seems charming and mature—though perhaps too mature, with flirtatious flattery towards his governess. Miss Giddens soon grows disturbed by the children's occasional odd behaviours and secretiveness, and is bothered by disembodied voices and apparitions of a man and woman she witnesses in the house and grounds, whom Mrs Grose identifies from their descriptions as Miss Jessel and the uncle's valet, Peter Quint, also dead. Mrs Grose also reluctantly reveals that the two had been in a relationship. Miss Giddens concludes that the ghosts of Quint and Miss Jessel possess the bodies of the children so they can physically continue their relationship. She is determined to rescue them from this possession, first planning to break her promise to their uncle and write to him, but she is thwarted by a weeping apparition of Miss Jessel in the schoolroom. She then sends Mrs Grose and Flora to him in London. Left alone with Miles, Miss Giddens presses him to talk about the ghosts, and about why he was expelled from school. Initially, Miles is glib and evasive, but he eventually admits that he frightened the other boys with violence and vulgar language. She enjoins him to say who taught him this language and behaviour. Miles suddenly begins yelling obscene insults and laughing maniacally, and Quint's face appears in the window behind him, joining in the boy's laughter. Miles then runs outside; Miss Giddens follows, begging him to \"say his name\". Quint appears on a hedge nearby, but Miles does not seem to see him. He finally shouts Quint's name, and Quint waves his hand. Miles grows still and falls to the ground. Miss Giddens cradles him and assures him that he is free. She then realises that Miles is dead.

One day Kuzma agrees to help an old lady to deliver a washing machine to her house, (there used to be different fees for doing do – if the building had an elevator – there would be one price for it, if there was not one – then it would cost you more money to deliver it as it requires more time and effort) and accidentally drops it.

    "Synopsis": "The film takes place in Edo in the year 1630. A rōnin called Tsugumo Hanshirō arrives at the estate of the Iyi clan and says that he wishes to commit seppuku within the courtyard of the palace. To deter him, Saitō Kageyu, the daimyōs senior counselor, tells Hanshirō the story of another rōnin, Chijiiwa Motome — formerly of the same clan as Hanshirō. Saitō scornfully recalls the practice of rōnin requesting the chance to commit seppuku on the clan's land, but in fact hoping to be turned away and given alms. Motome had arrived at the palace a few months earlier and made the same request as Hanshirō. Infuriated by the rising number of \"suicide bluffs\", the three most senior samurai of the clan—Yazaki Hayato, Kawabe Umenosuke, and Omodaka Hikokuro—persuaded Saitō to force Motome to follow through and kill himself, ignoring his request for a couple of days delay. Upon examining Motome's swords, his blades were found to be made of bamboo. Enraged that any samurai would \"pawn his soul\", the House of Iyi forced Motome to disembowel himself with his own bamboo blade, making his death slow, agonizingly painful, and deeply humiliating. Despite this warning, Hanshirō insists that he has never heard of Motome and says that he is sincere in wanting to commit seppuku. Just as the ceremony is about to begin, Hanshirō is asked to name the samurai who shall behead him when the ritual is complete. To the shock of Saitō and the Iyi retainers, Hanshirō successively names Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuro — the three samurai who coerced the suicide of Motome. When messengers are dispatched to summon them, all three decline to come, with each claiming to be too ill to attend. While waiting for the messengers to return, Hanshirō recounts his life story to the assembled samurai, starting with the admission that he did know Motome. In 1619, his clan was abolished by the Shōgun. His lord decided to commit seppuku and, as his most senior samurai, Hanshirō planned to die alongside him. To prevent this, Hanshirō's closest friend took his place instead, leaving Hanshirō responsible for his teenage son, Motome. In order to support Motome and his own daughter Miho, Hanshirō rented a hovel in the slums of Edo, taking up work as a fan and umbrella craftsman while Motome became a teacher. Realizing the love between Motome and Miho, Hanshirō arranged for them to marry. Soon after, they had a son, Kingo. When Miho became ill with tuberculosis, Motome could not bear the thought of losing her and did everything to raise money to hire a doctor. When Kingo also fell ill, Motome left one morning, saying he planned to take out a loan from a moneylender. Later that evening, Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuro brought home Motome's mutilated body, and described and mocked his death before leaving. It is now clear that Motome had requested a delay so he could visit his family and put his affairs in order. A few days later, Kingo died, and Miho lost the will to live and died, leaving Hanshirō with nothing. Finishing his story, Hanshirō explains that his sole desire is to join Motome, Miho, and Kingo in death. He explains, however, that they have every right to ask him whether justice has been exacted for their deaths. Therefore, Hanshirō asks Saitō if he has any statement of regret to convey to Motome, Miho, and Kingo. He explains that, if Saitō does so, he will die without saying another word. Saitō refuses, calling Motome an \"extortionist\" who deserved to die. After provoking Saitō's laughter by calling the samurai moral code bushido a facade, Hanshirō reveals the last part of his story. Before coming to the Iyi estate, he tracked down Hayato and Umenosuke and cut off their topknots. Hikokuro then visited Hanshirō's hovel and, with great respect, challenged him to a duel. After a brief but tense sword fight, Hikokuro suffers a double disgrace: his sword is broken and his topknot is taken as well. As proof, Hanshirō removes their labelled topknots from his kimono and casts them upon the palace courtyard. He mocks the Iyi clan, saying that if the men he humiliated were true samurai, they would not be hiding out of shame. He also questions the clan's honor and bushido itself, pointing out that they should not have ignored Motome's request for a delay to his seppuku without investigating the reason why he asked, but they were too preoccupied with their supposed honor to care. Having badly lost face, an enraged Saitō calls Hanshirō a madman and orders the retainers to kill him. In a fierce battle, Hanshirō kills four samurai, wounds eight, and contemptuously smashes into pieces the antique suit of armor which symbolizes the glorious history of the House of Iyi. Finally, the clan corners Hanshirō and prepares to kill him not with swords, but with three matchlock guns. As Hanshirō commits seppuku, he is simultaneously shot by all three gunmen. Terrified that the Iyi clan will be abolished if word gets out that \"a half starved rōnin\" killed so many of their retainers, Saitō announces that all deaths caused by Hanshirō shall be explained by \"illness\". At the same time, a messenger returns reporting that Hikokuro had killed himself the day before, while Hayato and Umenosuke are both faking illness. Saitō angrily orders that Hayato and Umenosuke be forced to commit seppuku as atonement for losing their topknots. Those three deaths are also to be attributed to \"illness\". As the suit of armor is cleaned and re-erected, a new entry in the official records of the House of Iyi is read by a voiceover. Hanshirō is declared to have been mentally unstable, and he and Motome are both listed as having died through harakiri. The Shōgun is said to have issued a personal commendation to the lord of the Iyi clan for how his councilors handled the suicide bluffs of Motome and Hanshirō. At the end of his letter, the Shōgun praises the House of Iyi and their samurai as exemplars of bushido. As workers scrub the blood from the ground of the clan's estate, one of them finds a severed topknot and places it in his work bucket.",

    "Synopsis": "In the prologue, told through photographs, a group of schoolboys are evacuated from England following the outbreak of an unidentified war. Their aircraft is shot down by a briefly-glimpsed fighter plane and ditches near a remote island. The main character, Ralph, is seen walking through a tropical forest. He meets a chubby, bespectacled boy who reveals his school nickname was Piggy but asks that Ralph not repeat that. The two go to the beach where they find a conch seashell, which Ralph blows to rally the other survivors. As they emerge from the jungle, it becomes clear that no adults have escaped the crash. Singing is then heard and a small column of school choirboys, wearing dark cloaks and hats and led by a boy named Jack Merridew, walk towards the other survivors. The boys decide to appoint a chief. The vote goes to Ralph, not Jack. Initially, Ralph is able to steer the boys (all of whom are aged between about six and fourteen) towards a reasonably civilised and co-operative society. The choirboys make wooden spears, creating the appearance that they are warriors within the group. Crucially, Jack has a knife. Ralph, Jack, and a choirboy named Simon go off to explore, find out they are indeed on a deserted island and that there are wild pigs on the island. The boys have another assembly where Ralph tells the boys to make a fire. The boys build shelters and start a signal fire using Piggy's spectacles. With no rescue in sight, the increasingly authoritarian and violence-prone Jack starts hunting and eventually finds a pig, which they hunt. Meanwhile, the fire, for which he and his \"hunters\" are responsible, goes out, losing the boys' chance of being spotted from a passing aeroplane. Piggy chastises Jack, and Jack strikes him in retaliation, knocking his glasses off and breaking one lens. Ralph is furious with Jack. Soon some of the boys begin to talk of a \"beast\" that comes from the water. The next day, twins Sam and Eric, see something on the mountain and they tell the boys it's another beast. All the boys except Piggy and the littluns go searching for it. Ralph, Jack and another boy named Roger continue on to the top of the mountain and see something move. The boys run away. The next day, Jack, obsessed with this imagined threat and tired of listening to Ralph, leaves the group to start a new tribe, one without rules, where the boys paint their faces, play and hunt all day. Soon, more follow until only a few, including Piggy, Sam and Eric, are left with Ralph. Events reach a crisis when Simon finds a sow's head impaled on a stick, left by Jack as an offering to the beast. He becomes hypnotised by the head, which has flies swarming all around it. Simon then climbs the mountain and sees that what the other boys thought was a beast is actually the dead body of a parachutist. Simon runs down in an attempt to tell the others the truth but the frenzied boys, in the darkness, mistaking him for the beast; stab and beat him to death. Grieving over Simon's death, Ralph blames himself for not stopping the hunters for killing Simon but Piggy confronts him and convinces him that it was an accident. Piggy also defends the group's actions with a series of rationalizations and denials. Later on, the hunters raid the old group's camp and steal Piggy's glasses. Ralph goes to talk to the new group at their fortress, Castle Rock, using the still-present power of the conch to get their attention. However Jack refuses to listen. When Piggy takes the conch, they are not silent (as their rules require) but instead jeer. Roger dislodges a boulder from a cliff which falls on Piggy, killing him and crushing the conch. Piggy's body falls into the ocean and he floats face down. Ralph runs and hides in the jungle, later returning to visit Sam and Eric, who've been forced to join Jack's tribe by Roger. They warn him that Jack plans to hunt him down and kill him. The next morning, Jack and his hunters set fires to try and smoke him out. Ralph staggers across the smoke-covered island while the chant \"kill the pig\" draws closer. Stumbling onto the beach, Ralph falls at the feet of a Royal Navy officer and landing party, who stare at the painted and spear-carrying savages that the boys have become. One of the youngest boys, Percival, tries to tell the officer his name, but cannot remember it. The last scene shows Ralph sobbing as flames spread across the island.",

The anarchist leader, Vozhak, dominates the crew, while the commissar is tasked with reorganizing the naval unit into the First Sailors' Regiment to fight on the Black Sea front. Among the few remaining officers is Lieutenant Bering, a former tsarist navy officer from the battleship Imperator Pavel I, who is appointed to lead the regiment alongside the commissar. Her mission proves challenging as she must earn the sailors’ trust and eradicate the rampant anarchy. Vozhak incites an attempt to assault the commissar, but she defends herself, shooting one of the attackers and declaring defiantly, \"Well, who else wants to try the commissar's body?\" Despite pressure from his follower, the syphilitic Sipy, to kill her, Vozhak refuses, arguing that her anarchistic spirit makes her valuable. A tense dialogue ensues between the commissar, Vozhak, Sipy, and another anarchist sailor, Alexei, as they debate their loyalties and purpose. The commissar asserts the Bolsheviks’ direction and determination, even amidst resistance and skepticism. When the unit is reformed and sent to the front, the sailors confront difficult moral choices. Vozhak orders the execution of two former officers, only for the commissar to retaliate by commanding Alexei to execute Vozhak. Sipy betrays the unit, leading to their capture by German forces. The commissar is killed, but Alexei and a few others manage to escape captivity.",

    "Synopsis": "Robert is a school teacher in an undisclosed Bohemian village. He is under stress from Charlie, the foreboding town mayor who controls the happenings in town, and from his unfaithful and uncaring lover. Robert is forced to teach his students a ‘black and white’ view on life and a realist view on art, stifling imagination. For an ‘artistic’ painting class, Oliva, a castellan (and storyteller) is invited as the subject. Instead of posing as a model, Oliva recounts a story of a cat with sunglasses – whose eyes revealed the true nature of the human condition through colour. Red, importantly, was the colour of ‘lovers’ – well-meaning people, whilst colours like yellow and purple were reserved for the unfaithful, envious and unruly. The ‘normal’ people eventually killed the cat, for they didn't want others to know who was good or bad. In the midst of a circus act coming to town, Robert's cat goes missing and he is led to Diana – an actress who is part of the performance. He meets the magician who bears a striking resemblance to Oliva and talks to Robert about his ‘nature’ – joshing Robert about his choice of ‘normal’ clothes. During the performance to the entire town, Oliva's tales of the cat come to fruition when the cat is revealed to everyone watching – and Diana takes off its sunglasses. The moment of everyone's colours being revealed drives the entire town insane, fighting amongst themselves. Robert, whose true nature is red, finds himself entranced with Diana – and the two embark on a romantic, idyllic outing. Whilst the cat is later found by children in the woods, the school servant snatches it and attempts to have it killed – orchestrated by Charlie. Robert is tasked to teach children about a taxidermized stork in front of Charlie, but moved by the cat's power, gives a moving speech to the children that they shouldn't have to study the dead animal. This angers Charlie and the superiors in the town, who attempt to frame Robert for killing the cat. At one point, the children go missing, stating that they will return if the cat's safety is ensured. This sends the town amok, with families squabbling in the woods to find their lost loved ones. But the children are nowhere to be found – not even Robert can find them, who tells them to come back. Eventually, the servant returns the cat and the children come out from hiding. When the crowd debates what to do with the cat, Diana and the circus act reappear to expose Charlie's true colors – a ‘chameleon’ of personalities, who is chased out of the town, reigniting the initial chaos in the town. When Robert tries to chase after Diana to accompany her, he is accosted by the frenzied crowd and loses her as the act travels out of town. Defeated, Robert walks alone back into the town square, only to be greeted by the children, who are holding art and paintings of the cat.",

    "Synopsis": "In Sicily in the year 1860, Don Fabrizio Corbera, Prince of Salina, enjoys the customary comforts and privileges of his ancestry. War has broken out between the armies of Francis II of the Two Sicilies and the insurgent volunteer redshirts of Giuseppe Garibaldi. Among the rebels is the Prince's nephew, Tancredi Falconeri, whose romantic politics the Prince hesitantly accepts with some whimsical sympathy. Upset by the uprising, the Prince departs to Palermo. Garibaldi's army subjugates the city and expropriates Sicily from the Bourbons. The Prince muses upon the inevitability of change, with the middle class displacing the ruling class while on the surface everything remains the same. Refusing to bend to the tide of changes, the Prince departs to his summer palace at Donnafugata. A new national assembly calls a plebiscite and the nationalists win 512–0, thanks to the corruption and support of the town's leading citizen, Don Calogero Sedara. Don Calogero is invited to the villa of the Corberas, and he brings his daughter Angelica with him. Both the Prince and Tancredi are taken by Angelica's beauty. Soon thereafter, Tancredi makes plans to ask for her hand in marriage. The Prince sees the wisdom of the match because he knows that, due to his nephew's vaulting ambition, Tancredi will be in need of ready cash, which Angelica's father will happily provide. With the blessing of both the Prince and Don Calogero, Tancredi and Angelica get engaged. Noticing Tancredi shift his allegiance from Garibaldi to King Victor Emmanuel's newly-formed army, the Prince wistfully judges that his nephew is the kind of opportunist who will flourish in the new Italy. Cavalier Chevalley, a representative from the Kingdom of Sardinia, comes to the Prince's villa. He pleads with the Prince to join the senate of the nascent Kingdom of Italy, hoping that the Prince's great compassion and wisdom will help alleviate the perceived poverty and alleged ignorance on the streets of Sicily. However, the Prince demurs and refuses this invitation, observing that, in his view, Sicily prefers its traditions to the delusions of modernity because its people are proud of their ancient heritage. He says he foresees his brand of aristocratic rulers, whom he refers to as leopards and lions, being replaced by more bureaucratic rulers, who he calls jackals and hyenas, but that everyone, including the \"sheep\" of the general public, will continue to see themselves as the \"salt of the earth\". The Prince recommends Don Calogero would make a more appropriate senator. The Corberas, including Tancredi, attend a great ball at the villa of a neighbouring prince, and the event marks the debut of Angelica in high society. Afflicted by a combination of melancholia and the ridiculousness of the nouveau riche, the Prince wanders forlornly from room to room, increasingly disaffected by the entire edifice of the society he so gallantly represents—until Angelica approaches and asks him to dance. He accepts and, momentarily, recaptures and presents the elegant and dashing figure of his past self, but, after the dance, he quickly becomes disenchanted again. In the early morning, the Prince leaves the ball alone. Walking with a heavy heart through the empty streets, he pauses to let a hurrying priest pass and enter a home to deliver last rites, and then walks into a dark alley that symbolises Italy's fading past, to which he feels he belongs.",

    "film_title": "This Sporting Life",
    "Synopsis": "Set in the fictional city of City, the film is about Frank Machin, a bitter young coal miner from the West Riding of Yorkshire. The first part of the story is told through a series of flashbacks when Frank is anaesthetised in a dentist's chair, having had his front teeth broken in a rugby league match, and recovering at a Christmas party. The second part takes place after he has fully regained his senses, and proceeds without flashbacks. Following a nightclub altercation, in which Frank takes on the captain of the local rugby league club and punches a couple of other players, he asks a scout for the team, whom he nicknames \"Dad\", to help him get a tryout. Although at first somewhat uncoordinated at the sport, he impresses Gerald Weaver, one of the team's owners, with the spirit and brutality of his playing style during the trial game. He receives a large signing bonus to join the top team as a loose forward (number 13) and impresses all with his aggressive forward play. He often punches or elbows the opposing players—and sometimes even those of his own team. Off the field, Frank is much less successful. His recently widowed landlady, Mrs Margaret Hammond, a mother of two young children, rebuffs Frank's attempts to court her and treats him rudely and abrasively. She lost her husband in an accident at Weaver's engraving firm, but received little financial compensation, because the death was suspected to be a suicide. One day, Frank takes Margaret and her children to play in the River Wharfe next to Bolton Priory. Another time, Margaret gets annoyed when Frank comes home drunk. He desires her sexually and, eventually, grabs her and forces her onto his bed. Her daughter interrupts them, but then she acquiesces and they have recurring sexual relations. At Weaver's Christmas party, Frank quarrels with Weaver and his predatory wife, whose advances Frank had rejected previously, much to her chagrin, and it is clear that he has lost Weaver's favour—though Slomer, the team's other owner, now supports him more fastidiously. When he gets home after the party, Margaret agrees to share his bed to keep him warm, as he looks unwell with his swollen face and missing teeth. But, in her grief, she cannot really return his affection, saying she is scared to invest her feelings in one person, as they might abandon her or die. She sometimes insults him, referring to him as \"just a great ape\", and, on their first proper date, Frank insults the staff and flaunts protocol at the fancy restaurant to which he takes her. Margaret is embarrassed and leaves, and the scene is witnessed by the Weavers, who icily shun him. Maurice, Frank's friend and teammate, gets married, and Frank and Margaret attend the ceremony. When Frank goes over to congratulate the couple, Margaret walks away. She says she feels ashamed, like a kept woman, especially since Frank bought her a fur coat. He strikes her, and then says he thought she was finally becoming happy. On another occasion, she says that their neighbours think she is a slut and she and the children are not \"proper people\" because of Frank. They have a row, and Frank goes out drinking with Maurice. He says he wants another job, \"something permanent\", and believes Margaret needs him, though she does not realise it. Frank tries to talk to Margaret, but she defends her privacy, saying he knows nothing about Eric, her deceased husband. He says she drove Eric to suicide, and Margaret, outraged, demands that Frank leave as she starts throwing his belongings out of his room. Frank says he loves her, but she is furious with him. Eventually, he goes to stay at Dad's cheap boarding house in a bombed-out area, leaving his Jaguar incongruously parked outside. Intending a reconciliation with Margaret, Frank returns to her house where he is met by their neighbour who says she is in hospital. The doctor tells him that Margaret is unconscious, having suffered a brain haemorrhage, and that she may not have the strength, or perhaps the will, to survive. Frank sits with her, holding her hand and talking gently. Distracted by a large spider on the wall, when he looks back at Margaret, blood seeps from her mouth, and she dies. In his rage, Frank slams his fist into the spider, killing it. He does not speak to the children or their minder when he leaves the hospital. Returning to Margaret's house and breaking in by the back door, Frank wanders through the empty space and calls out her name before collapsing in tears. In the closing scene, Frank is seen on the rugby field, now exhausted and vulnerable to the ravages of time and injury.",

    "Synopsis": "The story is set during the Great Depression in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama. Scout, aged six, lives with her older brother Jem and their widowed father Atticus, a white middle-aged lawyer. Guided by a strong social conscience, Atticus often represents poor farmers who pay him in produce or firewood. Jem and Scout befriend Dill, a boy who visits each summer. The three are both frightened and intrigued by their reclusive neighbour, Arthur \"Boo\" Radley. They fuel each other's imaginations with tales about him and devise ways to lure him outside. After two summers, Scout and Jem begin finding small gifts left in a tree outside the Radley house. Atticus is appointed to defend Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a young white woman and the daughter of Bob Ewell, a violent and racist drunkard. The case inflames racial tensions in the town, and Jem and Scout are taunted at school. On the night before the trial, Atticus positions himself outside the jail where Tom is being held. A lynch mob arrives. The children unexpectedly intervene, and Scout, recognizing the father of a schoolmate, starts a friendly chat. Embarrassed, he persuades the mob to disperse. Jem and Scout sneak into the courtroom to see Tom's trial. With no available seats on the main floor, a local pastor invites them up to the coloured balcony. Mayella claims that she invited Tom in to chop up a chifforobe and that he grabbed her by the throat, beat her, and raped her. Witnesses testify that she had bruises on her neck and both arms and had been heavily 'knocked about' the right side of her head. Atticus points out that the attacker must have been left-handed, and that Tom had entirely lost the use of his left arm some years earlier in a farming accident. In spite of witness assertions, there was no medical evidence of any rape, nor was any doctor called. Atticus suggests that Mayella was actually beaten by her own father, who is indeed left-handed; she unconvincingly denies it. Tom testifies that Mayella had invited him in to help with some chores, as she had done many times before. When he noted that the house was unusually quiet, she explained that she had saved up and sent the children off into town to buy ice creams. She then kissed him against his will. Feeling extremely uncomfortable, Tom was attempting to leave when Bob appeared, drunk and enraged. Asked by the prosecution lawyer why he had been doing chores for Mayella without payment, Tom replies that he had \"felt sorry for her\" – words that offend the white spectators. Atticus urges the all-white jury to put aside prejudice and recognize Tom's innocence; nonetheless, Tom is found guilty. As Atticus leaves the courtroom, the black spectators in the gallery rise in respect. Atticus hopes for an appeal, but learns from Sheriff Tate that Tom has been shot dead while supposedly trying to escape. He breaks the news to Tom's family. Bob Ewell appears and spits in his face. Autumn arrives. While walking home through the woods, Jem and Scout are attacked. Jem suffers a broken arm and is knocked unconscious, but amid the confusion, someone intervenes and Scout sees a strange man carrying Jem home. Atticus calls for a doctor and for Sheriff Tate. As Scout finishes telling the sheriff what happened, her father introduces her to a man shyly standing behind the door: their rescuer, Boo Radley. Ewell is found dead at the scene. Atticus mistakenly assumes Jem must have stabbed him in self-defense, but Sheriff Tate knows that Boo acted to protect the children. Realizing, however, that no purpose would be served by prosecuting Boo, he insists that Ewell must have fallen on his own knife. Scout walks Boo home, taking a moment to stand on the Radley porch to imagine life from his perspective. An adult Scout narrates, recalling that eventful summer and how Atticus had sat all night by Jem's bed, ready to be there for him when he awoke.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1917, \"Baby Jane\" Hudson is a spoiled and capricious child actress who performs in vaudeville theaters across the country with her father, who acts as her manager and accompanies her on stage on the piano. Her success is such that a line of porcelain dolls is made in her image. Meanwhile, her shy older sister Blanche lives in her shadow and is treated with contempt by the haughty Jane, cruelty by her father, and weak apologies by her mother. As the sisters reach adulthood, their situations undergo a reversal; Jane's style of performing falls out of fashion, and her career declines as she descends into alcoholism, while Blanche becomes an acclaimed Hollywood actress. Mindful of a promise made to their mother, Blanche attempts to maintain a semblance of a career for Jane, going as far as to prevail on producers to guarantee acting roles for her. One evening in 1935, Blanche's career is cut short when she is paralyzed from the waist down in a mysterious car accident that is unofficially blamed on Jane, who is found three days later in a drunken stupor. By 1962, Blanche and Jane are living together in a mansion purchased with Blanche's film earnings. Blanche's mobility is limited due to her reliance on a wheelchair and the lack of an elevator to her upstairs bedroom. Jane has become a grotesque, mentally unstable alcoholic who regularly abuses Blanche. When Blanche's old films begin airing on television, renewing her popularity among her fans, Jane becomes increasingly jealous and resentful. She fixates on the success and adoration she once had as a child star and decides to revive her old act with hired pianist Edwin Flagg. When Blanche informs Jane she intends to sell the house, Jane correctly suspects Blanche will commit her to a psychiatric hospital once the house is sold. She removes the telephone from Blanche's bedroom, cutting her off from the outside world. During Jane's absence, Blanche desperately drags herself down the stairs and calls her doctor for help. Jane returns to find Blanche on the phone and beats her unconscious before mimicking Blanche's voice to dismiss the doctor. After tying Blanche to her bed and locking her in her room, Jane abruptly fires their housekeeper, Elvira, when she comes to work. While Jane is away, the suspicious Elvira sneaks into the house and attempts to access Blanche's room. Concerned by the lack of a response, Elvira starts to remove the door's hinge pins with a hammer. Jane returns home and, threatened with a call to authorities, reluctantly gives Elvira the key. As soon as Elvira enters Blanche's room, Jane takes the hammer and kills Elvira. Edwin comes by the house, but Jane refuses to answer the door. That night, she uses Blanche's wheelchair to move Elvira's body to her car. A few days later, the police call to tell Jane that Elvira's cousin has reported her missing. Jane panics and prepares to leave, taking Blanche with her. Before they can go, an inebriated Edwin is escorted to the house by police, who leave him there. Upon discovering Blanche bound to her bed, Edwin flees and notifies the authorities. Jane, in a fit of infantile regression, takes Blanche to a beach where she sang as a child. The next morning, the news of Elvira's murder and Blanche's condition is on the radio and the police are on the lookout. Weakened and near death, Blanche confesses to Jane that she caused her own accident. On the night in question, Blanche tried to run Jane over because she was angry at her drunken sister for mocking her at a party. Blanche's spine broke when her car struck the gates outside their mansion, and she dragged herself in front of the car's hood to stage the accident and frame Jane. Blanche took advantage of Jane's shock and subsequent bender, concealing the real cause of the accident from her, which subjected Jane to a life of guilt, loneliness, and servitude. Now aware of the truth, a saddened Jane responds, \"You mean all this time, we could have been friends?\" When Jane gets ice cream for herself and Blanche from a nearby refreshment stand, she is recognized by two police officers, who ask her to lead them to Blanche, attracting the attention of nearby beachgoers. Jane dodges the officers' inquiry and dances before the crowd of curious onlookers. The officers find Blanche nearby and rush to save her.",

    "Synopsis": "Julie Cullen is a young divorced parent, on her own for the past four years since her husband abandoned her and their daughter, Ellen, only a year old at the time. At work, Julie, who is white, meets Frank Richards, who is black, and the two strike up a friendship that blossoms into a romance. Their relationship is strained by the racial prejudices of many around them, including Frank's parents, William and Martha, who oppose the pairing. But ultimately, Frank and Julie decide to persevere through such difficulties. Later on, they get married which leads Julie and Ellen to move in with Frank and his parents. Ellen's arrival immediately softens Martha's heart, but William remains cool toward Julie, steadfast in his belief that Frank and Julie's marriage is a foolish endeavor. His attitude changes only when Frank and Julie have a son together. When William first holds his new grandson, he loses any remaining animosity and the household becomes a happy one for all. Eventually, Julie's ex-husband, Joe, returns, seeking to establish a visitation relationship with Ellen. However, when he finds that Julie's and Ellen's new family is black, he finds this unacceptable and petitions the court for legal custody of Ellen. Frank's lawyer tells him that Joe is likely to win. Agreeing with the lawyer's analysis, William advises Frank to take Julie and the children and flee the state. Frank, however, decides to stay and fight the case in court. When Julie appeals to Joe directly, it only angers him, and he even briefly attempts to force himself on Julie physically. When Frank learns what has happened, he is intensely frustrated by his inability to defend his wife by directly confronting Joe, since he knows that if he does, that will be the end of whatever small chance he and Julie have of winning the custody case. The judge in the case looks carefully into Ellen's family situation, including interviewing her directly. She affirms how much she loves Frank and she seems oblivious to the racial issues at play. When the judge asks her about her baby brother being \"different\" from her, the only thought that occurs to her is that her brother is a boy, while she is a girl. The judge recognizes that the family situation in the Richards home is superior for Ellen in every way except for the fact that she is white, growing up in a black household. While the judge does not condone racial prejudices and agrees that they should be fought, he also says that he cannot ignore that they exist and, if Ellen remains with Frank and Julie, will negatively impact her when she reaches adulthood. For that reason, he grants Joe's petition for custody. When Joe arrives to pick up Ellen, she is excited, initially under the impression that her father is taking her for a short visit from which she will soon return. When she finally realizes that she's being sent to live with him permanently and that her brother is remaining behind, she assumes that she is being punished for having misbehaved in some way. Joe loads Ellen and her clothes into a taxi as the family looks on in sorrow. As the taxi drives away with Joe and Ellen in the back seat, she helplessly presses her face against the car's rear window, shouting back to her mother, pleading to be allowed to stay and promising that she will be a good girl.",

    "Synopsis": "The Passenger begins in 1960, fifteen years after the end of World War II. The setting is a transatlantic voyage aboard a luxury liner en route from South America to Europe. Liza Kretschmer (Alexandra Śląska), a former concentration camp SS officer, has a chance encounter with a fellow passenger who was one of her inmates at the camp, Marta (Anna Ciepielewska). Aboard the vessel, the roles of Liza and Marta are more or less reversed. Marta is in a position to expose the former Nazi as a war criminal, and if not to the authorities, at least to Liza’s husband, who is ignorant of her past. The meeting unleashes a cascade of memories for Liza, in which she struggles to revisit the events at the extermination center, and the nature of her behavior towards Marta. In a series of flashbacks, Liza’s internal narrative, which serves to rationalize her role, clashes with memories of the systematic murder of men, woman and children that characterized the Holocaust. The complexities of the relationship between perpetrator and victim reveals the degradation of Marta, who survived by accommodating herself to her oppressors.",

Agnese, who is 15, is \"seduced\" by her sister Matilde's fiancé, and has a tryst with him for which she confesses and tries to repent, only to be discovered by her mother and father when she shows symptoms of pregnancy. Vincenzo immediately demands that the man, Peppino Califano, marry his daughter. Peppino decides he does not want to marry her, as she is no longer a virgin. Vincenzo, incensed by this, plots to murder him and attempts to induce his son Antonio do so. Agnese becomes aware of the plot and escapes her home (in which her family is locking her in) to report it to the police. The police arrest both parties and both men deny anything happened. The prosecutor ultimately decides to charge Peppino with statutory rape, since she was under the age of consent which was 16. Both sets of parents pressure Agnese to marry him as there is an exception to statutory rape laws if the parties had eloped. Vincenzo forces Peppino to stage a fake kidnapping of Agnese and then marry her. Everyone appears before the magistrate to inform him of the happy ending to the story. But things do not go as planned: when the magistrate asks Agnese for confirmation, the girl bursts into tears and the magistrate deduces that she is being forced into marriage. As the Ascalones return home from the magistrate's court, the villagers mock them vehemently. This is too much for Vincenzo, who suffers a heart attack. Confined to bed, he manages to convince Agnese to marry Peppino, then dies in secret, sacrificing his life on the altar of honour so as not to delay the wedding. Matilde takes her vows to become a nun.",

    "Synopsis": "The film's narrative revolves around Jo Armitage, a woman with an ambiguous number of children from three marriages, who becomes negative and withdrawn after discovering that her third (and current) husband, Jake, has been unfaithful to her. After a series of loosely related events in which Jake's infidelity is balanced by his reliability as a breadwinner and a father, Jo and Jake take a first tentative step toward reconciliation. Thematically, there are two issues: Jo's frequent childbearing and Jake's extramarital affairs. The question of Jo's fertility is first broached by her psychiatrist. He suggests that she may feel uncomfortable with the messiness or vulgarity of sex and that she may be using childbirth to justify it to herself. This does not prevent her from becoming pregnant again, but she follows suggestions by Jake and her doctor that she have an abortion and be sterilized, and she seems happy after the operation. Meanwhile, signs accumulate that Jake has been having affairs while pursuing a successful career as a screenwriter. The first indication of his infidelity concerns Philpot, a young woman who lived with the Armitage family for a while. Jake reacts irrationally and unconvincingly to Jo's questions after the children tell her the woman fainted into Jake's arms. The second sign comes from Bob Conway, an acquaintance who alleges an affair between his wife and Jake during production of a film in Morocco. Finally, Jake admits some of his infidelities under heated interrogation by Jo. After venting her frustration by furiously assaulting him, she retaliates by having an affair with her second husband. This elicits coldness from Jake. In the film's finale, Jo spends a night alone in a windmill (near the converted barn she had lived in with her second husband and children) that the couple has been renovating. The following morning, Jake and their children arrive at the windmill with food. Seeing how happy her children are with Jake, Jo indicates her acceptance of him sadly, but graciously, accepting a tin of beer from him, a gesture which echoes another scene in the windmill from a happier time in their marriage.",

    "Synopsis": "The film begins with a happy couple, Eleni and Petros, at an amusement park in Athens, celebrating their affair. Some time later, Eleni and Petros are together again on a beautiful day, but she has to go, so she leaves for her secret workplace: The Red Lanterns. There, Eleni and many other girls work as prostitutes. Each of them has her own story: Eleni, the protagonist, originates from Romania and travelled to Greece looking for a better life; however, because of choices she has made, she is now the most famous of the prostitutes. Anna is a young woman in love with Captain Nicholas. She has a child with him, but he doesn't know. Mary (Mairi Chronopoulou) is the eldest of them and the most \"masculine\" in manners. A young customer named Angelos falls in love with her, and soon they begin a passionate love affair. Marina, a girl from a village far away from Athens, is madly in love with Doris, her \"manager.\" All of them work in the home of Madam Pari (Despo Diamantidou), a professional madam and former prostitute herself. Katerina is a kindhearted, poor, abused, and ignored cleaning woman and servant there. She is married to an old man who is institutionalized. Michalis is Eleni's \"manager\" and also in love with her; however, she hates him. Soon, another woman joins their \"home.\" Myrsine is a 16-year-old girl who becomes one of them after being pursued by a cop. Michalis tries to seduce her but doesn't succeed. After Captain Nicholas leaves, Anna tells Helen that she has a child with him and that no one knows. Anna then tells her son Alex the truth about his father and waits for Captain Nicholas' return. On Christmas Eve, Angelos proposes to Mary, but she laughingly rejects him. Doris leaves Marina, who is crying and screaming, threatening to kill herself. Eleni arrives at the Christmas party after having had a romantic dinner with Petros. Petros follows her, and when he discovers her secret, he beats her. Crying, she tries to explain everything, but he leaves crying, too. After everything that's happened, The Red Lanterns close down.

    "Synopsis": "Pierre Lachenay, a middle-aged married father and renowned writer, lecturer, and editor of a literary magazine, flies to Lisbon. As he disembarks, photographers approach Pierre and ask him to pose for a picture with Nicole, a young stewardess. After delivering a lecture in a sold-out auditorium, Pierre returns to his hotel, where Nicole is also staying. He takes the elevator with her and, having noticed the room number on her key, calls her from his room to invite her for a drink. She declines, but shortly after hanging up, calls back. They agree to go out for drinks the following evening, even though Pierre had been scheduled to catch a plane at noon. On their date, Pierre and Nicole talk in a bar until sunrise, and then return to their hotel and have sex. The next day, she slips him her phone number on the flight back to Paris, and Pierre tries to call Nicole that night while he and his wife Franca are entertaining friends. However, Nicole is not at home. When Pierre gets hold of Nicole the next day, they meet up. He begins to use excuses to slip away and meet Nicole at the airport between her flights. They arrange to spend the night together, though not at her apartment, as the landlady knows her parents. They go to a nightclub and plan to stay at a hotel, but they do not check in, as the circumstances begin to make them feel sordid. Pierre takes Nicole home and invites her to go on an overnight trip to Reims the following week. She agrees, and, not wanting him to return to Franca, invites Pierre up to her apartment. Pierre and Nicole drive to Reims and check into a hotel. He only agreed to his friend Clément's request to introduce a screening of Marc Allégret's 1951 documentary Avec André Gide so he could be alone with Nicole. However, he has to go to a dinner, give his speech, and then go out for drinks with Clément, while Nicole sits alone at the hotel, cannot get tickets to the sold-out screening, and is repeatedly propositioned by a man on the street. To avoid going to a reception after the screening, Pierre says that he has to return to Paris, but Clément asks for a ride. Pierre agrees, only to ditch Clément and get Nicole from the hotel. After driving through the night, Pierre and Nicole reach an inn in the countryside. They enjoy themselves, until Pierre calls Franca to say that he had to extend his stay in Reims and learns that she knows that he is lying. Pierre drops Nicole off at her apartment and goes home, where Franca accuses him of having an affair. He claims that he just needed time alone, but she does not believe him and says that they should separate. Calling Franca's bluff, Pierre does not argue and goes to sleep at his office. Franca informs Pierre that she is initiating divorce proceedings. When he goes to retrieve his belongings, she alternates between treating him coldly, hitting him, begging him for forgiveness, and kissing him. They end up having sex. As Pierre is leaving, Franca asks if he wants to return to her, but he replies that it would never work. Franca's friend Odile later sees the state Franca is in. Odile fears that Franca may attempt suicide and throws away sleeping pills she finds in the bathroom. At a restaurant, Pierre gets embarrassed by Nicole's loud talking, and she asks him to take her home. Pierre apologizes and says that he has had a tough week and that he misses his daughter. When Pierre later shows Nicole the apartment he plans for them to share, she says that she has realized that they are incompatible and ends the affair. Meanwhile, Franca uses a receipt from the pocket of one of Pierre's jackets to pick up photographs Pierre took of him and Nicole on their romantic weekend. Franca then goes to a restaurant that Pierre frequents, tosses the photos at him, and shoots him with a shotgun. Dropping the weapon, she sits down and smiles.",

    "Synopsis": "Madame Émery and her 17-year-old daughter Geneviève run a tiny, struggling umbrella boutique in the coastal town of Cherbourg, Normandy. Guy is a young auto mechanic who lives with and cares for his sickly aunt and godmother Élise. The boutique is saved from bankruptcy when Roland Cassard, a kind, young, very wealthy Parisian jeweler, agrees to buy some of Madame Émery's jewelry. Though Madame Émery disapproves, Guy and Geneviève are deeply in love; they plan to marry and name their first child Françoise. At the same time, Madeleine, a quiet young woman who looks after Élise, is secretly in love with Guy. Guy is drafted to serve in the Algerian War. The night before he leaves, he and Geneviève pledge their undying love and have sex. Geneviève learns she is pregnant and writes to Guy, but his replies are sporadic. Her mother tells her that Guy has forgotten her and she should move on. Geneviève is courted by Roland, who wants to marry her despite her pregnancy. In one of the connections among Demy's trilogy of films, Roland had previously unsuccessfully wooed the title character in the earlier Lola (1961); now he relates a version of this story to Madame Émery. Madame Émery urges Geneviève to choose a secure future with Roland. Roland announces that he will be going to Amsterdam for three months, and will wait for Geneviève's answer until his return. Upon his return Geneviève marries him in a great cathedral, but she appears ambivalent about her decision. Returning injured from the war, Guy learns that Geneviève has married and left Cherbourg. He has a difficult time readjusting to civilian life. After an argument with his boss at the garage, he quits his job, goes drinking in a seedy bar, and spends the night with a prostitute. When he returns to his apartment, Madeleine tells him that Élise has died. Guy sees that Madeleine loves him, and he rebuilds his life with her help. Using his inheritance, he opens a new American-style gas station. Madeleine agrees to marry him, though she wonders whether he is merely on the rebound after losing Geneviève. Four years later, on a snowy Christmas Eve, Guy and Madeleine are in the office of their gas station with their small son François. As Madeleine and François leave to visit Santa Claus, a now wealthy Geneviève and her daughter Françoise arrive. Guy invites Geneviève into the station's office, where she reveals this is her first time in Cherbourg since her marriage. When asked if he wants to meet his daughter, Guy declines. On her way out, Geneviève looks back at Guy one last time before driving off. Madeleine returns with François, and Guy greets her with a kiss.",

    "Synopsis": "Karla Zachanassian, a wealthy woman, returns to the decaying village where she grew up. She had been run out of town twenty years prior when, at 17 years old, she was impregnated by local shopkeeper Serge Miller; at his trial, Serge denied paternity and bribed two local men to testify that they had slept with Karla, destroying her credibility and ensuring he would not be found liable. The greedy townspeople now welcome Karla back in the hopes that she will give them money to revive the town, which has fallen into economic depression since the closing of the local factory. At a reception in her honour, Karla offers to give the town $2,000,000 ($1,000,000 for the town itself, and $1,000,000 to be divided equally amongst the population) on the condition that Serge be put to death. The townspeople act indignant, but soon turn on Serge, while Karla watches gleefully from her hotel. First, they demand expensive items from Serge's shop on credit. Later, Karla imports expensive items such as televisions, furniture, and designer clothes, and offers them to the town on credit without down payment. She also befriends Anya, a young, naïve girl who is having an affair with the much older, married chief of police, whom Karla sees as a young version of herself. Serge appeals to the corrupt mayor and chief of police, only to find they have been seduced as well. When Karla's pet panther escapes, the town organises an armed posse to find it, which quickly turns into a lynch mob targeting Serge; at this point, even his wife forsakes him. Serge tries to flee the town, but the population refuses to let him leave. Eventually, the council (which has expelled Serge) reinstates the death penalty, and convenes a kangaroo court in the town square. The mayor and chief of police offer Serge the chance to die by suicide, but he refuses. He is found guilty at the trial and sentenced to death. Karla immediately hands over two $1,000,000 cheques, to the cheers of the crowd. Karla then stops the execution and tells the citizens that they will have to live with the guilt of their murderous choice for the rest of their lives, while Miller will have to live with the knowledge that his wife, friends, and neighbours were willing to kill him for money. Karla leaves the town, after giving Anya enough money and a car of her own to escape her fate.",

    "Synopsis": "In New York City, concert pianist Henry Orient pursues an affair with a married woman, Stella Dunnworthy, while two adolescent private-school girls, Valerie \"Val\" Boyd and Marian \"Gil\" Gilbert, stalk him and write their fantasies about him in a diary. Henry's paranoia leads him to believe that the two girls, who seem to pop up everywhere he goes, are juvenile private detectives sent by his would-be mistress' husband. In reality, 14-year-old Val, the bright, imaginative daughter of wealthy international trade expert Frank Boyd and his unfaithful, snobbish wife Isabel, has developed a teenage crush on Henry after seeing him in concert, and has involved her best friend Gil. Although Gil's parents are divorced, she lives a relatively stable, happy life in a townhouse in the city with her mother and her mother's also-divorced female friend, while Val, whose parents are still married (albeit unhappily), sees a psychiatrist daily and lives with paid caretakers while her parents travel the world. When Val's parents return for Christmas, she becomes concerned that her mother Isabel is having an extramarital affair with a young pianist. Val's interference leads her mother to find and read Val's diary. Isabel chastises Val and seeks out Henry, ostensibly to tell him to stay away from her underage daughter. The cheating Isabel and the womanizing Henry are quickly attracted to each other and begin an affair, which Val and Gil accidentally discover while stalking Henry outside his apartment. Val's devastation and Isabel's attempts to cover up her own behavior cause Frank to figure out what happened. Frank and Isabel separate while the paranoid Henry flees the country. However, positive changes for Val result as Frank, who, unlike Isabel, genuinely cares about his daughter, resolves to stop traveling so often and establish a real home where he and Val can spend more time together. In the end, Val and Gil have matured and moved on from fantasy play to makeup, fashion, and boys their own age.",

    "film_title": "Walking the Streets of Moscow",
    "Synopsis": "The film opens at a Moscow airport in summer 1963. A young man, Volodya (Aleksei Loktev), calls out to a young woman he sees singing to herself and dancing. :– Arriving or departing? :– Waiting for arrivals. :– Who is it? :– My husband. :– He's lucky to have someone to meet him. :– Get married, you'll have someone as well. :– And you are both happy? :– Yes, we are. :– It never happens. :– Believe me, it happens. Volodya is an aspiring writer from Siberia. His first short story has just been published in the magazine Yunost (\"Youth\"); and a famous author, Voronin, has invited him to Moscow to discuss his work. In the Moscow Metro Volodya unexpectedly makes a friend, Kolya (Nikita Mikhalkov), who is returning home after a hard night shift. Volodya wants to stay at his old friends' home, but he doesn't know the exact street so Kolya decides to help him find it. Unfortunately, a dog bites Volodya near Clean Ponds. Then Kolya decides to help his new friend again they go to Kolya's home where Kolya's sister sews Volodya's trousers and introduces him to Kolya's large family. Volodya realizes that his old Moscow friends aren't in Moscow anymore (they left for south) and Volodya stays at Kolya's. Then Volodya goes for a walk. At last alone, Kolya decided to sleep, but then came his old friend Sasha (Yevgeny Steblov). Sasha is in trouble he was planning on marrying his fiancée Sveta today, but he has been called up for military service. He begs Kolya to help him. Kolya helps. Then two young men go to the GUM department store to buy a suit for a bridegroom and they meet Volodya there (Volody has recently bought a new suit for himself). The friends decide to buy a present for the bride and they go to the music shop, because Kolya is attracted to the saleswoman, Alyona (Galina Polskikh). Volodya finds himself attracted to Alyona. He makes another attempt to see Voronin and Kolya invites himself along. Sasha and his fiancée Sveta have a spat over the phone. At Voronin’s home, Volodya mistakes a floor polisher for the writer and the floor polisher quickly reads Volodya’s 3-page story and criticizes it for not being true to life. The real Voronin arrives and asks Volodya to help with a literary collection by young Siberian writers. Sasha decides not to get married, cuts off his hair, and rejects the referral, but then shows up at the wedding anyway. Volodya looks for Alyona and, joined by Kolya, runs into her father, who reveals she went to a concert but gets upset about random men trying to woo his daughter. Unhappy with the meeting with Alyona’s father, Volodya lashes out at Kolya and they part. Kolya picks up Alyona from the concert and Volodya arrives as well. Alyona refuses to go to the wedding with Kolya. Kolya pretends he has telepathy to make a man in front of them turn around. He does and sees them staring at him and rushes off. Kolya, Alyona, and Volodya happen upon a show asking for volunteers to form two teams. The team that can draw the best horse in 5 seconds wins. Kolya’s team is faster but loses due to quality. Volodya accuses a man in the audience of being a thief. The man runs off and Volodya and a large portion of the audience, including the man Kolya claimed to use telepathy on, give chase. The “telepathy victim” accuses Volodya of being the thief, and they end up in a police station where the police are completely confused and cannot understand their stories and why they are there. Kolya enlists a passing woman to get on the phone with Alyona’s mother to vouch for her being out late at night with a female friend. Alyona, Kolya, and Volodya wind up at Sasha’s wedding reception only to find out Sasha and Sveta are splitting up because Sveta found out Sasha had cold feet earlier. Volodya dances with Alyona. Kolya watches despondently, then calls Sveta. When she refuses to pick up the phone, Kolya yells across the plaza to her building and the reception dancers below join him to get her attention. She picks up the phone. Kolya puts Sasha on and the couple make up. Alyona and Kolya see Volodya off as he returns to Siberia and then Kolya and Alyona say goodbye to each other. Kolya sings a song as he heads back to work.",

    "film_title": "Woman in the Dunes",
    "Synopsis": "Schoolteacher and amateur entomologist Niki Junpei leaves Tokyo for a rural coastal village to collect tiger beetles and other insects. He is self-absorbed, dissatisfied with his life in Tokyo, and rude to his hosts. After a long day of searching, Junpei misses the last bus ride back to the city. The locals invite him to spend the night at their village. Junpei agrees and is guided down a rope ladder to a hut at the bottom of a sand dune, which resembles a large pit. Due to the steep slopes of the dune, the ladder appears to be the only way in or out. Junpei learns that his host, a young woman, lost her husband and daughter in a sandstorm a year ago and now lives alone; their bodies are said to be buried under the sand somewhere near the hut. The widow explains that the sand is constantly falling on the house, and without shoveling it out every day, she will be buried. After dinner, the widow goes outside to shovel the sand into buckets, which the villagers reel in from the top of the dune. Junpei offers to help, but she refuses, telling him that he is a guest and there is no need for him to help on the first day. A passer-by ominously refers to Junpei as the widow's \"helper\". The next morning, Junpei gets ready to leave but finds that the rope ladder has been pulled up. He tries and fails to climb up the dune. He realises that the villagers trapped him in the pit so that he can live with the widow and help her dig sand, which the village sells to a cement company on the black market. The widow is as much a slave of the villagers as Junpei is. The villagers control both of them by limiting their access to water and provisions. The widow has long resigned herself to her fate, and entreats Junpei to help her shovel the sand. Although Junpei points out that the sand is poor quality and will make defective cement, she crassly explains that it is not her problem. With the sand piling up in and around the house, Junpei finally agrees to help the widow dig; however, he continues plotting his escape. Although the widow has trapped Junpei, she also grows emotionally attached to him. The two become lovers. Junpei uses an improvised grappling hook to haul himself out of the pit. However, the villagers chase him into quicksand, which forces him to ask his captors for help. The villagers free him and return him to the widow. Like the widow, Junpei eventually resigns himself to his situation. Frustrated with the monotony of the pit, he asks his captors to see the nearby sea every day. The villagers agree on the condition that he has sex with the widow while they watch. Junpei agrees, but the widow refuses, calling him a pervert. Junpei tries to force himself on the widow anyway, but she fends him off while the villagers watch. Through his persistent efforts to trap a crow as a messenger, Junpei discovers a way to draw water from the damp sand at night by capillary action. His efforts to perfect the technique help him settle into an easy routine. When an ectopic pregnancy threatens to kill the widow, the villagers take her to a doctor. They leave the rope ladder hanging, and Junpei climbs out. He chooses to go back in the pit, telling himself that he can still escape later. He muses that he would like to show someone his method of water production, and the villagers would be the best audience. The film's final shot is of a police report stating that Junpei has been missing for seven years.",

    "Synopsis": "Lieutenant Apostol Bologa, an ethnic Romanian serving in the Austro-Hungarian Army, votes to sentence Second Lieutenant Svoboda to death. Svoboda is an ethnic Czech serving in the Austro-Hungarian Army who is found guilty of desertion and sentenced to death by hanging. While awaiting for Svodoba to arrive at his execution, Bologa meets Captain Klapka. Captain Klapka, also an ethnic Czech, is recently transferred from the Italian front to serve in the same regiment as Bologa. They, along with the majority of the regiment, witness the execution of Svoboda. The execution of Svoboda deeply affects Bologa. Combined with the influence of Czech Captain Klapka and other minority soldiers in the Austro-Hungarian army, the seeds of doubt are planted in Bologa. He begins to question his role in the empire and the purpose of his life. Bologa joins his fellow officers for dinner. There he faces sharp criticism, especially from Captain Cervenko, for his role in voting for the execution of Svoboda. Cervenko is a pious man who believes in Tolstoy's views. He is an adherent to non-violence and is said to carry a bat into battle. Cervenko proclaims that agony is necessary, and only in agony can true love grow. Klapka responds in a sardonic tone by saying that this love they immerse themselves in is only nourished with bullets and hangings. A Hungarian officer gets up and responds by noting that despite all their talk Cervenko still goes to battle, Bologa still fights against his fellow Romanians, and the Czech officers stood by as one of their own got hanged. That same officer talks about a \"weird\" Johan Müller, and his dream of an Internationale where all ethnicities unite. He sarcastically jokes that they already have this in Austria-Hungary, a place where all ethnicities fight in an International Imperial Army. After dinner, Bologa and Klapka head to their room to sleep. Bologa sits in the quarters he now shares with Klapka. Bologa is clearly troubled and keeps repeating that Svoboda was innocent. Klapka responds by saying they are all guilty and gives Bologa a bottle to drink from. Before Bologa can fall asleep, a bright beam of light floods the room from outside. It rotates persistently, keeping both him and Klapka awake. Klapka remarks that they shouldn't curse the light, given the darkness they find themselves in. He goes on to say that any light, no matter who or where it comes from, is always welcome. Bologa is forced to judge twelve Romanian peasants accused of espionage. Unable to bear the thought of condemning more of his fellow Romanians, he decides to desert towards the Romanian lines. Before he can reach them, he is caught and sentenced to hanging. As he is transported to jail before his execution, he passes through the forest where the twelve Romanian peasants he was meant to judge now hang from the trees.

    "Synopsis": "An impoverished swordsman in Kyoto divorces his wife, a weaver, and leaves her for a woman from a wealthy family to attain greater social status. However, despite his new wealthy status, the swordsman's second marriage proves to be unhappy. His new wife is shown to be callous and selfish. The swordsman regrets leaving his more devoted and patient ex-wife. The second wife is furious when she realizes that the swordsman not only married her to obtain her family's wealth, but also still longs for his old life in Kyoto with his ex-wife. When he is told to go into the chambers to reconcile with her, the swordsman refuses, stating his intent to return home and reconcile with his ex-wife. He points out his foolish behavior and poverty as the reasons why he reacted the way he did. The swordsman informs his lady-in-waiting to tell his second wife that their marriage is over and she can return to her parents in shame. After a few years, the swordsman returns to find his home, and his wife, largely unchanged. He reconciles with his ex-wife, who refuses to let him punish himself. She mentions that Kyoto has \"changed\" and that they only have \"a moment\" together, but does not elaborate further. She assures him that she understood that he only left her in order to bring income to their home. The two happily exchange wonderful stories about the past and the future until the swordsman falls asleep. He wakes up the following day only to discover that he had been sleeping next to his ex-wife's rotted corpse, the corpse also rapidly decays into a skeleton on the next appearance. Rapidly aging, the swordsman stumbles through the house, finding that it actually is in ruins and overgrown with weeds. He manages to escape, only to be attacked by his ex-wife's black hair. Two woodcutters from Musashi Province, 18-year-old Minokichi and his elderly mentor Mosaku, take refuge in a boatman's hut during a snowstorm. Mosaku is killed by a . When the yuki-onna turns to Minokichi, she sympathetically remarks that he is a handsome boy and spares him because of his youth, warning him never to mention what happened or she will kill him. Minokichi returns home and never mentions that night. One day, while cutting wood, Minokichi meets Yuki, a beautiful young woman traveling at sunset. She tells him she lost her family and that she has relatives in Edo who can secure her a job as a lady-in-waiting. Minokichi offers to let her spend the night at his house with his mother. The mother takes a liking to Yuki and asks her to stay. She never leaves for Edo, and Minokichi falls in love with her. The two marry and have children, living happily. The older women in the town are in awe over Yuki maintaining her youth even after having three children. One night, Minokichi gives Yuki a set of sandals he has made. When she asks why he always gives her red ribbons on her sandals, he tells her of her youthful appearance. Yuki accepts the sandals and tries them on. She is stitching a kimono in the candlelight. In the light, Minokichi recalls the yuki-onna and sees a resemblance between them. He tells her about the strange encounter. It is then that Yuki reveals herself to be the yuki-onna, and a snowstorm comes over the home. Even though he broke his word, she cannot bring herself to kill him because of her love for him and their children. Yuki then spares Minokichi and leaves on the condition that he treats their children well. As Yuki disappears into the snowstorm, a heartbroken Minokichi places her sandals outside in the snow. After he goes back inside, the snow covers the sandals, implying that Yuki took them with her. Hoichi is a young blind musician who plays the . His specialty is singing the chant of The Tale of the Heike about the Battle of Dan-no-ura fought between the Taira and Minamoto clans during the last phase of the Genpei War. Hoichi is an attendant at a temple and is looked after by the others there. One night he hears a sound and decides to play his instrument in the garden courtyard. A spectral samurai appears and tells him that his lord wishes to have a performance at his house. The samurai leads Hoichi to a mysterious and ancient court. Another attendant notices that he went missing for the night as his dinner was not touched. The samurai re-appears on the next night to take Hoichi and affirms that he has not told anyone. Afterwards, the priest asks Hoichi why he goes out at night but Hoichi will not tell him. One night, Hoichi leaves in a storm and his friends follow him and discover he has been going to a graveyard and reciting the Tale of Heike to the court of the dead Emperor. Hoichi informs the court that it takes many nights to chant the entire epic. They direct him to chant the final battle - the battle of Dan-no-ura. His friends drag him home as he refuses to leave before his performance is completed. The priest tells Hoichi he is in great danger and that this was a vast illusion from the spirits of the dead, who plan to kill Hoichi if he obeys them again. Concerned for Hoichi's safety, a priest and his acolyte write the text of the Heart Sutra on his entire body including his face to make him invisible to the ghosts and instruct him to meditate. The samurai re-appears and calls out for Hoichi, who does not answer. Hoichi's ears are visible to the samurai as they forgot to write the text on his ears. The samurai, wanting to bring back as much of Hoichi as possible, rips his ears off to show his lord his commands have been obeyed. The next morning, the priest and the attendants see a trail of blood leading from the temple. The priest and the acolyte realize their error and believe the ears were a trade for Hoichi's life. They believe the spirits will now leave him alone. A local lord arrives at the temple with a full retinue. They have heard the story of Hoichi the earless and wish to hear him play his biwa. Hoichi is brought before the lord and says he will play to console the sorrowful spirits. The narrator states that many wealthy nobles came to the temple with large gifts of money, making Hoichi wealthy. Anticipating a visit from his publisher, a writer relates an old tale of an attendant of Lord Nakagawa Sadono named Kannai. While Lord Nakagawa is on his way to make a New Year's visit, he halts with his train at a teahouse in Hakusan. While the party is resting there, Kannai sees the face of a strange man in a cup of tea. Despite being perturbed, he drinks the cup. Later, while Kannai is guarding his Lord, the man whose face appeared in the tea reappears, calling himself Heinai Shikibu. Kannai runs to tell the other attendants, but they laugh and tell him he is seeing things. Later that night at his own residence, Kannai is visited by three ghostly attendants of Heinai Shikibu. He duels them and is nearly defeated, but the author notes the tale ends before things are resolved and suggests that he could write a complete ending, but prefers to leave the ending to the reader's imagination. The publisher soon arrives and asks the Madame for the author, who is nowhere to be found. They both flee the scene in terror when they discover the author trapped inside a large jar of water.",

    "Synopsis": "The film opens after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. In the beginning, we meet the three female protagonists at the same maternity hospital. They are all related to the Eka gård, owned by Petra von Pahlen. Angela, Petra's niece, is expecting a child with Thomas, the archaeologist; Adèle, the wife of the tenant at Eka gård, Tord Holmström. Eka is inhabited by Angela's aunt; Agda, a maid and is married to the painter Stellan von Pahlen through a marriage of convenience. The father of Agda's expected child is Bernhard Landborg, one of the heirs to the neighboring estate Ösa. The plot is carried forward through flashbacks: Angela is depicted as a young girl at her father's funeral and then an 18-year-old at her birthday party at Eka. She has then been taken care of by her aunt Petra. Angela goes to school in a girls' boarding school, where she experiences the eroticism and desire. One of her schoolmates Stanny, Bernhard's sister, has taken a liking to her. Teacher Bell tries to seduce her. Later, it is depicted how Angela meets Thomas on a train by chance. Petra, who waits at the station for Angela, sees her former lover, who is now married and has a son. Adèle's childhood goes from well-to-do conditions to poverty due to her father's death. She is forced to go out and sell candies, among other humiliating experiences. Adèle experiences a romantic love story with Daniel, but due to mésalliance becomes married to the tenant Tord. The hatred towards this marriage and towards the upper class poisons her life. Agda is the most cheerful among the three even though she was born into a poor working class and her upbringing is not without any incidence: An older man tries to rape her during her childhood. On Midsummer Eve 1914, the people of Eka go to the neighboring estate Ösa, which is owned by bank manager Landborg. Angela sees Thomas again, and they fall in love. Bernhard, who is an officer, has sex with Agda in the bushes. During the supper, those present ask Agda to sing. She performs a Salvation Army song but people then talk over her singing. Stellan von Pahlen plays erotic games with Mrs. Landborg. During the dinner, Adèle is drunk and expresses her hatred. Tord escorts her home. The war breaks out. The men must go into military service and disappear from the women's everyday life. The new era is also coming to Eka. Electricity is installed. Stellan marries Agda after Bernhard offers 15,000 Kroner in annual annuity. At the hospital, Angela's relative Dr. Jacob Lewin, a gynecologist, watches over these three women. Adèle's dead fetus is removed from her body. Agda gives birth to her child. The film ends in Angela's childbirth, and a real filmed childbirth is used.",

From there it hopes to reach friendly ground and evacuation towards Kratieh on the Mekong. The leaders of the platoon are the fresh Second-Lieutenant Torrens and Warrant Officer (Adjudant) Willsdorff, a highly experienced soldier who is in his third turn in Indochina. Willsdorff is an Alsatian who was incorporated by force in the German Wehrmacht and fought on the Russian front. One of the NCOs Sergeant Roudier is mortally wounded in an early encounter set off unnecessarily by his officer's verve. The Laotian troops place their trust in cautious Willsdorff who knows the ropes and leads hardly by proxy through the marshes and tropical forests of Cambodia. Meager supplies are parachuted to the platoon by a friendly plane but part of the load is dropped into enemy lines. Fatality strikes and Lt Torrens eventually dies. Willsdorf leaves him to take refuge with mountain tribes.",

    "Synopsis": "Freddie Clegg is a lonely, socially awkward young man who purchases a 17th-century Kent farmhouse with winnings he has earned from the football pools. An amateur entomologist, he spends his time capturing butterflies, of which he has a large collection. He begins stalking a bourgeois London art student named Miranda Grey. One day, he follows Miranda into a pub in Hampstead before abducting her on the street, incapacitating her with chloroform. Miranda awakens inside the cavernous, windowless stone cellar of Freddie's farmhouse, which he has adorned with a bed, furnishings, clothing, painting tools, and an electric heater. She assumes she has either been taken for ransom or to be used as a sex slave and insists to Freddie that her father is not wealthy. Freddie explains he is not seeking sex or ransom; he explains that he and Miranda used to ride on the same bus years earlier in Reading and that he continued to follow her into London after she enrolled in art school. When he proclaims his love for Miranda, she fakes appendicitis as a ploy to escape but is caught. Freddie agrees that he will free Miranda after four weeks, an allotted period he believes will allow her to \"get to know him\". Freddie gradually allows Miranda small luxuries, such as leaving the cellar to obtain sunlight and take baths in the house under his supervision. When he fondles her aggressively, she tells him she will not fight him should he rape her, but that she will lose all respect for him. During one of her baths, Freddie's neighbor, Colonel Whitcombe, arrives at the farmhouse to introduce himself, resulting in Freddie gagging Miranda and tying her to pipes in the bathroom. She floods the bathroom in an attempt to get Whitcombe's attention, but Freddie diverts him, claiming his girlfriend inadvertently left the tub running. Freddie recurrently mentions one of Miranda's boyfriends, with whom he observed her socializing on numerous occasions. He allows Miranda to write a letter to her mother but discovers a small piece of paper in the envelope asking for help, and tears the letter apart in front of her. During a conversation about art and literature, Miranda further alienates Freddie, who accuses her of being an elitist. He proclaims that they could never be friends in \"the real world\". On the thirtieth—and allegedly final—day of her captivity, Freddie prepares a meal in the house for Miranda and gives her a dress to wear for the occasion. Over dinner, he asks Miranda to marry him. She agrees, but Freddie senses her hesitation. He then confronts her for being disingenuous, reminding her that witnesses are needed for a formal marriage. Miranda pleads with Freddie that he had promised to let her go after thirty days, but he simply tells her that he can do as he wishes. Feeling completely trapped, Miranda attempts to flee the house, but he corners her in his study and chloroforms her before lying with her in an upstairs bedroom. When she regains consciousness in the cellar, Freddie assures her that he did not rape her. He tells her he intends to keep her until she \"tries\" to fall in love with him. After having a bath one night, Miranda unsuccessfully attempts to seduce him, but he senses her artifice and compares her to a prostitute. When Freddie escorts her back to the cellar during a rainstorm, Miranda seizes a shovel with which she strikes him on the head. Though wounded, Freddie takes advantage of Miranda's subsequent hesitation and manages to drag her back into the cellar. She accidentally breaks the electric heater just after their struggle. Miranda remains locked in the cold cellar, soaking wet, while Freddie receives medical attention. He returns three days later to find Miranda ill with pneumonia and goes into town to get a doctor. When he returns, having changed his mind about a doctor, he finds Miranda dead. Freddie buries the corpse under an oak tree on his property. A short time later, Freddie, convinced Miranda brought her fate on herself, again drives around, now stalking a young nurse in the hopes that he might have better success overall with a different sort of woman.",

    "Synopsis": "In a British Army \"glasshouse\" (military prison) in the Libyan desert, prisoners convicted of service offences such as insubordination, being drunk while on duty, going AWOL or petty theft are subjected to repetitive drill routines as a punishment in the blazing desert heat. The arrival of five new prisoners slowly leads to a clash with the camp authorities. One new NCO guard who has also just arrived employs excessive punishments, which include forcing the five newcomers to climb, repeatedly, a man-made hill in the centre of the camp. When one dies, a power struggle erupts between brutal ex-civilian prison guard Staff Sergeant Williams, humane Staff Sergeant Harris, and Regimental Sergeant Major Wilson as they struggle to run the camp in conflicting styles. Roberts is a former squadron sergeant major from the Royal Tank Regiment, convicted of assaulting his commanding officer after orders to lead a suicidal attack. Roberts scorns Williams' brutality and challenges his authority. Like Roberts, the RSM is a career soldier and sees his duty as breaking down failed soldiers, then building them back up again \"into men\". Roberts arrived with McGrath, a hard northerner sentenced for drunkenness, and assaulting Military Policemen; Army office clerk Stevens, a timid and naive man jailed for AWOL; Bartlett, a spiv who shirks active service who has been convicted of selling stolen tyres to the Arabs; and the light-hearted King, a West Indian sentenced for drunk and disorderly conduct and stealing whisky from the officers mess. Staff Sergeant Williams' ambition fuels his cruel treatment of the prisoners and he openly seeks promotion. The RSM dryly points out Williams volunteered for North Africa just as the Germans began bombing London (where Williams previously worked). Williams tries to impress the RSM with a late-night drinking contest. Staff Sergeant Harris is the conscience of the prison who sympathises with the men. The RSM considers him too lenient, while the officers, both the commandant and the medical officer, take their duties casually. Williams singles out Bartlett and Stevens, the two weakest members of the group, and pushes Stevens' physical punishments to the point he dies from running up and down the artificial hill constructed in the camp. The prisoners rise in protest when Roberts accuses Williams of murder with King's support. The RSM faces down the general prison population, while Williams gangs up on Roberts in an empty cell and beats him. Williams tries to get Roberts' broken foot seen by the medical officer but the RSM prevents it and forces him to drill. King protests, and after being subjected to racial abuse by the RSM, refuses to wear his uniform or submit to army discipline. After the RSM attempts to blackmail the medical officer by pointing out he had rated Stevens fit for punishment, the medical officer and Harris agree to report Williams and the RSM for abuse. Roberts is left alone in a cell thinking they have won until Williams appears to beat him again. When King and McGrath intervene, they attack Williams as the film fades to black, while Roberts desperately pleads with them to stop, shouting \"you'll muck it up!\"",

    "Synopsis": "A scientist called Radcliffe is kidnapped from a train and his security escort killed. Harry Palmer, a British Army sergeant with a record of insubordination and a criminal past, now working for a Ministry of Defence organisation, is summoned by his superior, Colonel Ross, and transferred to a section headed by Major Dalby. Ross suspects that Radcliffe's disappearance is connected to the fact that sixteen other top British scientists have inexplicably left their jobs at the peak of their careers. He threatens Dalby that his group will be abolished if Radcliffe cannot be recovered. Palmer is then introduced as a replacement for the dead security escort. Afterwards, Dalby tells his agents that the main suspects are Eric Grantby and his chief of staff, codenamed \"Bluejay\" and \"Housemartin\" respectively, and orders the team to find out where they are at present. Palmer is also introduced to and befriends Jock Carswell. Using a Scotland Yard contact, Palmer locates Grantby but, when Palmer tries to stop Grantby getting away, he is attacked by Housemartin. Housemartin is arrested later but, before he can be questioned, he is killed by men impersonating Palmer and Carswell. Suspecting that Radcliffe is being held in a certain disused factory, Palmer orders a search, but nothing is found except a piece of audiotape labelled \"IPCRESS\" that produces meaningless noise when played. Dalby then points out that the paper on which Grantby had written a false phone number is the programme for an upcoming military band concert. There Dalby and Palmer encounter Grantby and a deal is struck for Radcliffe's return. The exchange goes as planned but, as they are leaving, Palmer shoots a man in the shadows who turns out to be a CIA agent. Subsequently, another CIA operative threatens to kill Palmer if he discovers that the death was not a mistake. Some days later, it becomes clear that while Radcliffe is physically unharmed, his mind has been affected and he can no longer function as a scientist. Carswell has discovered a booklet titled \"Induction of Psychoneurosis by Conditioned Reflex under Stress\" – IPCRESS – which he believes explains what has happened to Radcliffe and the other scientists. Carswell borrows Palmer's car to test his theory on Radcliffe, but is shot dead before reaching him. Believing that he himself must have been the intended target, Palmer goes home to collect his belongings and there discovers the body of the second CIA agent. When he returns to the office, the IPCRESS file is missing from his desk. Ross had previously asked him to microfilm the file and Palmer now believes that he is being set up. When he informs Dalby what has happened and that he suspects Ross, Dalby tells him to leave town for a while. On the train to Paris, Palmer is kidnapped and wakes up imprisoned in a cell apparently in Albania. After subjecting Palmer to several days without sleep, food and warmth, Grantby reveals himself as his kidnapper. Having previously read the file, Palmer realises that they are preparing to brainwash him. He uses pain to distract himself, but after many sessions under stress from disorienting images and loud electronic sounds, he succumbs. Grantby then instils a trigger phrase that will make Palmer follow any commands given to him. Palmer eventually fights his way out and discovers that he is still really in London. He phones Dalby, not knowing that Dalby is in Grantby's company at the time. Dalby uses the trigger phrase and gets Palmer to call Ross to the warehouse where he had been held. As Dalby and Ross arrive, Palmer holds them both at gunpoint. Dalby accuses Ross of killing Carswell; Ross tells Palmer that he had been suspicious of Dalby and was investigating him. Dalby now uses the trigger phrase again and tells Palmer to \"Shoot the traitor now\". As Palmer wavers, his hand strikes against a piece of equipment and the pain reminds him of his conditioning. Dalby goes for his gun and Palmer shoots him. Ross then remarks that, in choosing Palmer for the assignment, he had hoped that Palmer's tendency to insubordination would be useful. When Palmer reproaches Ross for endangering him, he is told that this is what he is paid for.",

    "film_title": "The Knack ...and How to Get It",
    "Synopsis": "Colin is a nervous schoolteacher working in London, observing rather than participating in the sexual revolution of the 1960s. He has little personal sexual experience and wishes to gain \"the knack\" of how to seduce women. He turns to his friend and tenant, a confident womaniser known only by his surname, Tolen. Tolen gives him unhelpful advice to consume more protein and use intuition, acknowledging that intuition is not something that can be completely learned. He advocates the importance of dominating women and suggests that Colin should let another friend move into Colin's spare room, and they could \"share\" women. Colin boards the front door shut. Tom, who is passing, takes up occupation of the vacant room. He is obsessed with painting everything white, including the windowpanes. Due to the blocked door, Tolen now brings his women in through the window. Colin swaps his single bed for a fancy old wrought-iron double bed that he finds in a scrapyard with Tom. Nancy meets Colin at the scrapyard. Nancy is an inexperienced and shy young woman who has arrived in London from out of town and is searching for the YWCA. She stops by a clothing store and is won over by the flattery of the clerk until she overhears him repeating the same words to every female customer. From the scrapyard, the three take the bed on a complex and zany journey back to the house. This includes parking it at a parking meter, moving it on a car transporter, floating it along the River Thames, and carrying it down the steps of the Royal Albert Hall. In a public space, Tolen sexually assaults Nancy, who at first is silent and then faints. When she wakes up, she claims she was raped, though this was not the case. Tolen, Colin, and Tom are unable to restrain her from loudly repeating the allegations or puncturing the tyres of Tolen's motorcycle. She runs back to the house, where she throws Tolen's records out of the window and strips naked. The men become convinced her rape allegations reflect a rape fantasy and urge Tolen to have sex with her. When Nancy emerges from the room wearing only a robe, she instead expresses more attraction to Colin, and he returns her interest. The two begin living together.",

    "Synopsis": "The opening sequence states that the film is based on true events. Set deep within Nazi Germany on June 22, 1942, the story follows the harrowing use of captured Soviet tanks by the Germans as live targets for testing their anti-tank weapons. These \"death crews\" are composed of Soviet prisoners of war and civilians from concentration camps. The film chronicles the escape of one such tank crew led by Ivan, a skilled mechanic and driver. The crew—consisting of three Red Army soldiers and a fighter from the French Resistance—breaks through enemy lines in a T-34 tank. Along the way, they rescue Soviet women forced into labor and destroy German forces. During their journey, they strike fear into a German town, disrupt its idyllic view of victory, raid supplies, and destroy a monument to a Teutonic knight. As the crew fights through enemy territory, they suffer losses: the French fighter is killed by a bomb, and two other crew members die after leaving the tank during an attack. In a final act of defiance and humanity, Ivan saves a young German boy crossing the road but is shot dead by German forces moments later.",

    "Synopsis": "During World War II in a small town in the First Slovak Republic (a client state of Nazi Germany), mild-mannered Slovak carpenter Antonín \"Tóno\" Brtko is chosen by his brother-in-law, who holds an influential position in the local fascist government, to take over the sewing notions (i.e. haberdasher) shop owned by the elderly Jewish widow Rozália Lautmannová as part of the Aryanization efforts in the country. While Brtko is struggling to explain to Lautmannová, who is nearly deaf, oblivious to the outside world, and generally confused, that he is now her supervisor, Imrich Kuchár, Brtko's friend and a Slovak who opposes Aryanization, enters and informs Brtko that the business is unprofitable and Lautmannová relies on donations to make ends meet. Kuchár tells Lautmannová that Brtko has come to help her and connects Brtko with the leadership of the Jewish community of the town, who agree to pay him a regular salary to remain the official Aryan controller of the shop, since, if he quits, he might be replaced by someone more militantly fascist or anti-Semitic. Brtko lets Lautmannová continue to run things in her shop, spending most of his time fixing her furniture or ineptly trying to assist her with customers, and the pair begin to develop a close relationship. When he hears that the authorities are going to gather the Jewish citizenry of the town and transport them elsewhere en masse, he does not tell Lautmannová and at first considers hiding her, but he starts to question this course of action when the roundup actually begins. Drinking steadily, he eventually loses his nerve and attempts to cajole and then force Lautmannová to join her friends in the street. She finally recognizes that a pogrom is happening and panics. Brtko chases her around inside the shop, but he stops and feels ashamed of himself after he witnesses his other Jewish neighbors actually being carted away. Seeing some soldiers heading toward the shop, he throws Lautmannová, who is in a frenzy, into a closet to hide her. The soldiers just glance in the window and keep walking. When Brtko opens the closet door, he discovers Lautmannová's dead body, and, devastated, hangs himself. The movie ends with a fantasy sequence in which the now deceased Lautmannová and Brtko run and dance through the town square together.",

    "Synopsis": "A young widow, Anne Gauthier, is raising her daughter Françoise alone following the death of her husband, who worked as a stuntman and died in a film set accident that she witnessed. Still working as a film script supervisor, Anne divides her time between her home in Paris and Deauville in northern France, where her daughter attends boarding school. A young widower, Jean-Louis, is raising his son Antoine alone following the death of his wife Valerie, who committed suicide after Jean-Louis was in a near-fatal crash during the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Still working as a race car driver, Jean-Louis divides his time between Paris and Deauville, where his son also attends boarding school. One day, Anne and Jean-Louis meet at the Deauville boarding school after Anne misses the last train back to Paris. Jean-Louis offers her a lift, and the two become acquainted during the drive home, enjoying each other's company. When he drops her off, he asks if she would like to drive up together the following weekend, and she gives him her phone number. After a busy week at the track preparing for the next race, Jean-Louis calls, and they meet early Sunday morning and drive to Deauville in the rain. Clearly attracted to each other, they enjoy a pleasant Sunday lunch with their children, who get along well. Later that afternoon, they go for a boat ride followed by a walk on the beach at sunset. Jean-Louis spends the following week preparing for and driving in the Monte Carlo Rally in southeast France. Every day, Anne closely follows news reports of the race, which takes place in poor weather conditions along the icy roads of the French Riviera. Of the 273 cars that started the race, only 42 were able to finish, including Jean-Louis's white Ford Mustang, number 145. Watching the television coverage of the conclusion of the race, Anne sends Jean-Louis a telegram that reads, \"Bravo! I love you. Anne.\" That night at a dinner for the drivers at the Monte Carlo Casino, Jean-Louis receives the telegram and leaves immediately. He jumps into the other Mustang (number 184) used during the race and drives through the night to Paris, telling himself that when a woman sends a telegram like that, you go to her no matter what. Along the way, he imagines what their reunion will be like. At her Paris apartment, Jean-Louis learns that Anne is in Deauville, so he continues north. Jean-Louis finally arrives in Deauville and finds Anne and the two children playing on the beach. When they see each other, they run into each other's arms and embrace. After dropping their children off at the boarding school, Jean-Louis and Anne drive into town where they rent a room and have passionate sex. While they are in each other's arms, however, Jean-Louis senses that something is not right. Anne's memories of her deceased husband are still with her, and she feels uncomfortable continuing. Anne says it would be best for her to take the train back to Paris alone. After dropping her off at the station, Jean-Louis drives home alone, unable to understand her feelings. On the train, Anne can only think of Jean-Louis and their time together. Meanwhile, Jean-Louis drives south through the French countryside to the Paris train station, just as her train is arriving. As she leaves the train, she spots Jean-Louis and is surprised, hesitates briefly, and then walks toward him, and they embrace.",

    "film_title": "Alfie (1966 film)",
    "Synopsis": "Alfie Elkins, a handsome, self-centered, narcissistic Cockney chauffeur in London, enjoys the sexual favours of married and single women while avoiding commitment. He is ending an affair with Siddie, a married woman, just as he gets his submissive girlfriend, Gilda, pregnant. Alfie thinks nothing of pilfering fuel and money from his employer and tells Gilda to do the same. Although he refuses to marry her, and despite his constant cheating, Gilda decides to have the child, Malcolm Alfred, and keep him rather than give him up. Over time, Alfie becomes quite attached to his son, but his unwillingness to marry Gilda causes her to break up with him and marry Humphrey, a kindly bus conductor and neighbour who loves her and is willing to accept Malcolm Alfred as his own. Gilda bars Alfie from any further contact with Malcolm, forcing him to watch from a distance as Humphrey steps into his fatherly role. When a health check reveals Alfie has tubercular shadows on his lungs, the diagnosis and his fear of death, combined with his separation from his son, lead him to have a brief mental breakdown. Alfie spends time recuperating in a pastoral sanatorium, where he befriends Harry, a fellow patient, a family man devoted to his frumpy wife, Lily. Alfie seduces one of the nurses, disgusting Harry. When Alfie flippantly suggests that Lily might be cheating on him, Harry angrily confronts Alfie about his attitudes and behaviour. Released from the convalescent home, Alfie briefly stops working as a chauffeur to take holiday photos of tourists near the Tower of London. He meets Ruby, an older, voluptuous, affluent and promiscuous American who, although accompanied by an older gentleman, gives him her address and telephone number. Alfie returns to chauffeuring and drives a Rolls-Royce to the sanatorium to visit Harry. He finds Lily finishing a visit with her husband, who asks him to give his wife a ride back to London to save her an exhausting train ride. Neither initially wants to spend time together, but they agree in order to please Harry. Along the way, they stop for tea and then a canoe ride where Alfie seduces Lily. Later, chauffeuring again, Alfie sees a young red-headed hitchhiker, Annie, who wants a fresh start in London. A lorry driver picks her up just before Alfie gets to her. He follows them to a cafe and steals her away to London. She moves into his bedsit where she proves preoccupied with a love left behind, scrubbing Alfie's floor, doing his laundry and preparing his meals to compensate. The lorry driver finds Alfie in a pub and punches him in the face, causing a bar brawl. Coming home with a black eye, Alfie grows resentful of Annie and drives her out with an angry outburst, immediately regretting it. Around the same time, Lily informs him that she is pregnant from their one encounter, and they plan for her to have an abortion. Lily comes to his flat to meet the abortionist. During the procedure, Alfie leaves Lily and walks around. He catches sight of his son Malcolm outside a church and witnesses the baptism of Gilda and Humphrey's new daughter. The abortion traumatizes both Lily and Alfie; he breaks down in tears when seeing the aborted foetus, the first time he confronts the consequences of his actions. Stressed by the situations with Annie and Lily, Alfie decides to change his non-committal ways and settle down with Ruby. However, visiting her, he finds a younger man in her bed. He comes across Siddie, but she has lost interest in him and returned to her husband. Alfie is left lonely, wondering about his life choices and the meaning of existence. A stray dog approaches him, and he takes it in his care as he walks off into the night.",

    "Synopsis": "Sir John Falstaff and Justice Shallow walk through the snow, then to a warm fire inside Shallow's home in Gloucestershire, as the two reminisce. King Henry IV of England has succeeded Richard II, whom he has killed. Richard II's true heir, Edmund Mortimer, is a prisoner in Wales, and Mortimer's cousins (the Percys) Northumberland, Worcester, and Northumberland's son Henry Percy (called \"Hotspur\") demand that the king rescue Mortimer. He refuses, and the Percys begin to plot his overthrow. To Henry's great dissatisfaction, his son Prince Hal spends most of his time at the Boar's Head Tavern, drinking and carousing with prostitutes, thieves, and other criminals under Falstaff's fatherly influence. Falstaff insists that he and Hal should think of themselves as gentlemen, but Hal warns Falstaff that he will one day reject both this lifestyle and Falstaff. The next morning, Hal, Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto, and Poins disguise themselves in Gadshill to prepare to rob a group of traveling pilgrims. After Falstaff, Bardolph, and Peto rob the pilgrims, Hal and Poins jump out in disguises and take the stolen treasure from Falstaff as a prank. Back at the tavern, Falstaff begins to tell Hal and Poins with increasing exaggeration the story of how the money was stolen from him. Hal and Poins poke holes in Falstaff's tale until they reveal their prank. In celebration of the newly recovered treasure, Falstaff and Hal take turns impersonating Henry, with a cooking pot crown and vocal impressions. Falstaff's Henry chastises Hal for spending his time with common criminals, but names Falstaff as his one virtuous friend. Hal's Henry calls Falstaff a \"misleader of youth\". Hal visits the king at the castle, and Henry scolds him for his criminal and unethical lifestyle. Henry warns Hal about Hotspur's growing army and its threat to his crown. Hal passionately vows to his unimpressed father that he will defend Henry and redeem his name. The King's army, including Falstaff, parades through the streets and off to war. Before the battle, Henry meets with Worcester and offers to forgive all of Hotspur's men of treason if they surrender immediately. Hal vows to kill Hotspur himself. Worcester returns to his camp and lies to Hotspur, telling him that Henry intends to execute all traitors. The two armies meet in the Battle of Shrewsbury, but Falstaff hides in shrubs for most of the conflict. After a long, bloody fight, the king's men win the battle, after which Hotspur and Hal meet alone and duel; as Falstaff watches, Hal kills Hotspur. Henry sentences Worcester to death and takes his men prisoner. Falstaff brings Hotspur's body to Henry, claiming that he killed Hotspur; Henry does not believe him, looking disapprovingly at Hal and the ignoble company he keeps. The narrator explains that all of Henry IV's rebellious enemies had been killed by 1408, but that Henry's health has begun to deteriorate. At the castle, Henry becomes upset when told that Hal is once again spending time with Falstaff, and collapses. Hal visits the castle and discovers that Henry is sicker than he had realized. Hal vows to Henry to be a good and noble king. Henry finally has faith in Hal and advises him on how to be a king. Henry dies and Hal tells his men that he is now King Henry V. Falstaff, Shallow, and Silence sit in front of the fire, continuing the film's first scene. They receive news of Henry IV's death and that Hal's coronation will be held that morning. Falstaff becomes ecstatic and goes directly to the castle, thinking he will become a great and powerful nobleman under Henry V. At the coronation, Falstaff cannot contain his excitement and interrupts the ceremony, announcing himself to Hal. Hal turns his back on Falstaff and proclaims that he is now finished with his former lifestyle. As Falstaff looks up at Hal with a mixture of pride and despair, the new king banishes him. The coronation continues into the castle as Falstaff walks away, claiming he will be sent for that evening. That night, Falstaff dies at the Boar's Head Tavern, and his friends mourn him, saying he died of a broken heart. Hal goes on to become a good and noble king.",

Yevgraf believes a young dam worker, Tanya Komarova, may be his niece and explains to her why. After his mother's burial, the orphaned child Yuri, owning only an inherited balalaika, was taken by family friends Alexander and Anna Gromeko to Moscow. In 1913, Zhivago, now a doctor and poet, becomes engaged to the Gromekos' daughter Tonya after her schooling in Paris. Meanwhile, 17-year-old Lara is seduced by her mother's much older friend/lover, the well-connected Victor Komarovsky. Lara's friend, the idealistic Pasha Antipov, who wishes to marry her, is wounded by mounted police at a peaceful demonstration. Lara treats Pasha's wound, and hides a gun he picked up. thumb|left|Tsarist dragoons attack a peaceful demonstration Discovering Lara's relationship with Komarovsky, her mother attempts suicide. Komarovsky attempts to dissuade Lara from marrying Pasha. She refuses and he has rough sex with her. A traumatised Lara later follows Komarovsky to a party, shoots him in the arm, and is escorted out by Pasha. Pasha marries her, despite now knowing about her relationship with Komarovsky. They leave Moscow. During World War I, Yuri, now married to Tonya, becomes a battlefield doctor. Pasha joins up, but is reported missing. Lara enlists as a nurse to search for him and encounters Zhivago. For six months, they serve at a field hospital, as unrest grows in Russia after exiled Vladimir Lenin returns. The two fall in love, but Zhivago remains faithful to Tonya. After Russia leaves the war, Yuri returns to Tonya, their son Sasha and the widowed Alexander Gromeko in their Moscow house, which was confiscated by the Soviet government and now houses many other people. Yevgraf, now a Cheka officer, tells Yuri his poems have been condemned as anti-communist. Yevgraf provides documents so the family can travel to the Gromekos' country home, \"Varykino\", in the Urals near Yuriatin. Their heavily guarded train travels through contested territory where Bolshevik commander Strelnikov is fighting anti-communist White forces. thumb|right|Yevgraf (Alec Guinness, right) with Tanya ([[Rita Tushingham)]] The train stops near Strelnikov's armored train. Yuri gets out, is captured and taken to Strelnikov, whom Yuri recognizes as Pasha. Strelnikov mentions that Lara lives in Yuriatin, now White-occupied. Strelnikov lets Zhivago return to his train. The family find the main house at Varykino sealed up by the Bolsheviks; they settle into a neighboring cottage. In Yuriatin, Yuri sees Lara, and they begin an affair. When Tonya is about to give birth to a second child, Yuri breaks off with Lara but is forcibly enlisted by Communist partisans. After two years, Yuri deserts and returns to Yuriatin. Lara says Tonya contacted her while searching for Yuri. Leaving his belongings with Lara, she returned to Moscow. Tonya later sent Lara a sealed letter for Yuri. Tonya had borne a daughter, and she, her father, and two children are living in Paris following deportation. Yuri and Lara become lovers again but Komarovsky arrives. Cheka agents have been watching them due to Lara's marriage to Strelnikov. Komarovsky offers them help escaping Russia, but they refuse, instead going to Varykino, and hiding in the main house. Yuri begins the \"Lara\" poems, which will bring him fame but government disapproval. Komarovsky arrives with troops. Recently appointed as a Far Eastern Republic official, he says the Cheka allowed Lara to remain in the area only to lure Strelnikov. He was subsequently captured five miles away and committed suicide on his way to execution by grabbing a guard's gun so they now intend to arrest Lara. Komarovsky's offer of safe passage is accepted, but once Lara is on her way, Yuri does not follow. On the train, Lara tells Komarovsky she is pregnant by Yuri. Years later, Yevgraf finds a Moscow medical job for his now frail half-brother. Yuri sees Lara in the street but suffers a fatal heart attack before reaching her. At Yuri's funeral, Lara asks Yevgraf for help finding her daughter by Yuri, who vanished during the civil war. Yevgraf helps her search the orphanages, in vain. Lara then disappears and Yevgraf believes she died in a gulag. Yevgraf believes that Tanya Komarova is Yuri and Lara's daughter; she remains unconvinced. Asked how she became lost, Tanya answers that her \"father\" (Komarovsky) let go of her hand when they were running from bombardment. Yevgraf responds that a real father would not have let go. Tanya promises to consider Yevgraf's words. Her boyfriend David arrives, and she leaves with him. Yevgraf notices Tanya carries a balalaika. He asks if she can play, and David replies, \"She's an artist!\", and says she is untrained. Yevgraf responds, \"Ah... then it's a gift!\"",

    "Synopsis": "The movie opens with a small Italian village being stormed by a band of Hungarian pillagers. When the murders and rapes are over, a German knight arrives and bravely kills the bandits. However, as he is healing his wounds he is attacked by two of the surviving villagers and one of the thieves. They throw the wounded knight into a river. The attackers try to sell the knight's armor and weapons to a miserly Jewish merchant who finds among his belongings a letter of donation by the Holy Roman Emperor, granting the knight the fief of Aurocastro, an Apulian town. The parchment is torn at the lower end, which refers to a condition the knight must fulfill to enjoy the donation. The Hungarian bandit comes up with the idea to propose a partnership to a cadet nobleman, so the group can take possession of the aforementioned fief and enjoy its riches. The knight they find is the poor and incompetent, yet well-meaning, Brancaleone da Norcia and they tell him that a noble knight handed them the parchment before dying. Brancaleone initially refuses the plan but after a farcical defeat at a jousting tournament that promised the hand of an overlord's daughter and a wealthy fief, he is too eager to take command of this \"army\" (L'Armata) of underdogs and lead it towards \"fortune\" and \"glory\", in what he sees as an epic journey. As they set up towards the fief, Brancaleone lives several grotesque adventures, inspired by the confused and cosmopolitan world of Italy during Middle Ages; each one of them more hilarious than the last. These include: * A Byzantine knight, Teofilatto dei Leonzi (Gian Maria Volonté), who proposes to fake his capture by the band so they can demand and share a ransom from his father. * An entire city seemingly abandoned, which they begin to pillage, until they find out that it was depopulated by plague. * A fanatical mad monk, Zenone (Enrico Maria Salerno), who promises that those who join his army of Crusaders will be \"healed\" from all ills, having the band follow him to a crusade in the Holy Land. When trying to convince his followers to cross a precarious bridge by leaping upon it (crying out loud that the Lord would protect them), the monk falls down into a deep gorge - this releases the band to follow their previous quest. * The rescue of a bride named Matelda (Catherine Spaak), who falls in love with Brancaleone, but is rejected by him due to his oath to take her to her groom; to Brancaleone's misfortune, she avenges herself by losing her virginity to the Byzantine knight (by then a member of the gang); later, while the 'army' is relaxing at her nuptial feast her husband finds out about her state and she accuses Brancaleone of deflowering her. * giving in to Teofilatto's plan, the army arrives at his father's castle to demand a ransom. His father refuses to pay, revealing that Teofilatto is his illegitimate child. Meanwhile, a confused Brancaleone has to fend off the sadomasochistically-fueled passion of Teofilatto's aunt, just one example of the inbred Byzantine household. When finally the band reaches the fief, they discover that the missing part of their parchment mentioned that condition for the granting of the fief was that its new ruler should have provided adequate defences against the \"black scourge coming from the sea\", frequent raids by Saracen corsairs. Brancaleone designs a cartoonish Rube Goldberesque trap to defeat the Saracens, but instead the band ends up trapped within. As the band is about to be executed by impalement, it is saved by the knight of the opening scenes, the rightful owner of the fief, thirsty for vengeance against his attackers. Brancaleone (who did not know about the attack on the knight) and his army are about to be burned alive when the mad monk arrives out of the blue and saves them from the knight, \"so they can fulfill their duty to go onto the Holy Land\". Being deprived of his dreams of richness, Brancaleone and his band agree to go along with the monk and his followers, saving themselves. Albeit sad, when he finds his untrustworthy horse, Brancaleone mounts and regains his confidence, taking the lead from the monk. The story is continued in a follow-up film, Brancaleone alle Crociate (1970).",

    "Synopsis": "In 1890 Kristiania (Oslo), an impoverished and lonely writer named Pontus (Per Oscarsson) comes to the city from the country. He stands on a bridge, overlooking running water, writing but clearly starving. He visits a pawnbroker several times. He sells his waistcoat for a few cents, then gives the money to a beggar. Other money that falls into his hands he also gives away. He has written an article that a newspaper editor (Henki Kolstad) agrees to publish if he makes some corrections, but Pontus is too proud to accept an advance when offered, so he leaves elated but still hungry. He begs a bone for his fictitious dog, which he gnaws on secretly in an alley. He often has the chance to make things better for himself, but his pride gets in the way, such as when he declines the much-needed help of a worried friend. When he is unable to pay his rent, the landlady (Else Heiberg) evicts him. Another landlady shortly does the same. Hunger is constantly overwhelming Pontus and he drifts between hallucination and reality while struggling to survive. He suffers humiliations which lead him to the edge of insanity. He applies for an accounting job but is rejected, and fails a physical exam to be a fireman because he wears glasses. One hallucination revolves around Ylajali (Gunnel Lindblom), an apparently refined woman he has met on the street. Despite their mutual flirtations, nothing ever evolves between them. On a sudden impulse, Pontus takes a job as a crew member on an outbound freighter. His destination is unknown.",

    "Synopsis": "The film is set in 1914 at the outset of World War I, focusing on Vladimir Lenin's time in exile in the village of Poronin, located in the Carpathian foothills on Polish lands within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Lenin, along with Nadezhda Krupskaya and her mother, Elizaveta Vasilievna, had previously visited Poronin two years before the war. By the summer of 1914, they had returned, moving from nearby Kraków. This location was convenient due to its proximity to the border with the Russian Empire. However, as tensions escalated, Lenin was suspected of espionage by the Austrian authorities. Eight days into the war, he was arrested as a subject of a hostile foreign power and imprisoned. Locals were so suspicious of Lenin that he faced threats of mob justice. Despite being ordered to report to the prison in Nowy Targ voluntarily, Lenin delayed his departure to send urgent telegrams to influential Austrian social democrats. Among these was Victor Adler, a parliament member who successfully lobbied for Lenin's release by persuading the Interior Minister that Lenin was a greater enemy of the Russian government than even the minister himself. On August 19, Lenin was freed and departed for Switzerland. The film portrays the events surrounding Lenin's arrest and the struggle for his release as a central storyline.",

    "Synopsis": "In a small French farming village, visiting Italian logger Manou and his son Bruno sleep in a barn. Manou's sexual dalliances with the local women arouse the hatred and envy of the male villagers, and the jealous villagers blame him for a spate of recent fires and a flood. However, he is innocent; the culprit is the local school teacher, only referred to as \"Mademoiselle\", a recent arrival admired by all, but sexually repressed and obsessed with Manou. In a flashback, she sets the first fire accidentally and enjoys watching a shirtless Manou perform heroics. Regarded by the villagers as someone of impeccable character and good breeding, in her apartment, behind closed doors, Mademoiselle has city footwear and clothing, and she puts on sexier attire for the occasions when she deliberately creates mayhem in the village. The fires and flood are no accident and express her mad passion for Manou, all in an attempt to watch him and to draw his attention to herself. In the meantime, Manou's son Bruno has witnessed her sociopathic nature in private and in the classroom, where she initially favours him as a pupil but then begins to verbally abuse him and repeatedly humiliates him. He discovers evidence that it is Mademoiselle, not his father, who is responsible for the catastrophes, but as a foreign outsider he stays silent. After many livestock are poisoned by Mademoiselle, some of the villagers take the law into their own hands and set off to punish Manou. Mademoiselle and Manou have an encounter in the forest, followed by a passionate night of lovemaking, after which she returns to the village, with the appearance of someone who has been raped. The villagers ask her if it was Manou who did this to her, she answers \"Yes!\" and enters her apartment. Then the men of the village find Manou and hack him to death. Mademoiselle leaves the village with her crimes not revealed, but Bruno knows and spits at her as she leaves.",

    "Synopsis": "thumb|Monica Vitti at the set in Amsterdam, 1966 thumb|Interview with Terence Stamp, Monica Vitti and director Joseph Losey After the assassination of one of their agents in Amsterdam, British Secret Service chief Sir Gerald Tarrant recruits former criminal mastermind Modesty Blaise to protect a shipment of diamonds en route to Abu Tahir, the Sheikh of a small Middle Eastern kingdom. The shipment has also attracted Gabriel, the head of a criminal organisation that includes his accountant McWhirter and bodyguard Mrs Fothergill. Modesty believes that Gabriel, who maintains a compound in the Mediterranean, is dead, but he reveals himself to her. In exchange for an exclusive discount on the kingdom's oil exports, the British government delivers periodic diamond shipments to the Sheikh. Modesty, who enjoys an ongoing love–hate relationship with law enforcement, is recruited not only for her competence, but because she is the Sheikh's adopted daughter and thus trusted by him implicitly. Modesty agrees to the arrangement, on the condition that she is given total immunity by the British government and complete freedom to deliver the diamonds how she sees fit. With Tarrant monitoring her from afar, Modesty travels to Amsterdam, where she reunites with her former lover Paul Hagen, a Secret Service agent and aide to Tarrant. She calls upon her longtime partner, Willie Garvin, who is reuniting with an old flame, Nicole, who may have information on Gabriel through her employer, an illusionist associated with him. Modesty narrowly survives several attempts on her life by Gabriel's assassins, whose failure leads to their swift execution by the ruthless Mrs Fothergill. Modesty continually toys with Paul, first seducing him before stealing his gun and disappearing. When Gabriel learns that Nicole is working with Modesty and Willie, he orders her assassinated. The illusionist sends thugs to have her killed, and they succeed when Modesty and Willie fail to intervene in time. Modesty and Willie set themselves up as live bait to draw Gabriel out, but find themselves pursued by Tarrant and a jilted Paul, being briefly arrested before quickly escaping with the help of some smoke bombs. When Modesty attempts to identify and infiltrate the boat being used by Gabriel for the planned diamond theft, she is lured into a trap and captured. Gabriel reveals his true plan, to use Modesty as leverage to force Willie to steal the diamonds for him. Willie reluctantly agrees to the arrangement, successfully stealing the diamonds from under Tarrant and Paul's noses. He and Modesty are subsequently taken to Gabriel's island fortress, where they are promptly thrown into prison cells. Gabriel offers Modesty to join forces, but she refuses. Willie and Modesty escape and kill Mrs Fothergill, and signal their location to the Sheikh's forces. The Sheikh leads his army to the island, leading to an all-out battle with Gabriel's forces and ending in his capture and the diamonds reaching their intended owner. In his desert camp, the Sheikh leaves Gabriel tied up outside to dehydrate. McWhirter suddenly appears in Highland dress to free his employer, though no one seems to notice or care. When the Sheikh asks Modesty what he can do for her, she asks for the diamonds. He responds by laughing boisterously and she seems to go along with it, but suddenly breaks the fourth wall by looking directly at the camera.",

His upper-class wife, Leonie, has given up on him and is in the process of getting a divorce in order to marry Charles Napier, an art gallery owner of her own social standing. Locked into a personal world of fantasy, Morgan performs a series of bizarre stunts in a campaign to win back Leonie, including putting a skeleton in her bed and blowing up the bed as her mother sits on it. When these stunts fail, Morgan secures the help of Wally \"The Gorilla\", a pro wrestler friend of his mother, to kidnap Leonie, who still nurtures residual feelings of love tinged with pity for Morgan. Leonie is left with Morgan and Wally in the British countryside (clips from Tarzan (1943) are cut into the film). Leonie soon gets rescued, and Morgan is arrested and imprisoned. After escaping, he dresses as a gorilla and crashes the wedding reception of Leonie and Charles. (Clips from King Kong (1933) are used to illustrate Morgan's fantasy world).

    "Synopsis": "Arthur Hamilton is a middle-aged banking executive in Scarsdale, New York, who, despite his professional success, remains profoundly unfulfilled. His love for his wife, Emily, has dwindled, and he seldom sees his only daughter, who has relocated to the West Coast and started a family. One day, Arthur receives an address placed into his hand by an unknown person who, somehow, knew his name. Later that day he receives a call from his childhood friend, Charlie, whom he believed to be dead. Though Arthur is initially disbelieving, Charlie claims it was he who approached him with the address and then recounts personal anecdotes that only he could know. Charlie informs him that he must go to the address provided; that it is imperative of him to do so because his life is empty of all motivation and choice. After some contemplation, Arthur decides to take up Charlie's proposition, and travels to the address, which he finds to be an apparent meat-packing plant; there, he is given workman's clothing and headgear, then exits the facility by a different door and is seated inside a truck that takes him to another building. There he meets a woman who directs him to an office and provides him with tea. He finds that he has been drugged and tries to leave the complex. He wanders around and disappears into a large area filled with dark, empty hallways and finds himself in a vulnerable woman's bedroom and while trying to become intimate with her, in his intoxication, he seemingly sexually assaults her. After waking, Arthur is informed that the Company's service comes at a cost of $30,000 and is shown a film of the prior staged assault, ostensibly to make his decision easier. Although he recoils at the apparent use of blackmail, Arthur reluctantly accepts on his own terms, after considering the emptiness in his life. The associates inform Arthur that they will fake his death in a hotel fire using an anonymous cadaver, and Arthur proceeds to undergo multiple extensive procedures by Dr. Innes that transform not only his facial features, but his vocal cords, teeth, and even fingerprints. Once healed, he is conferred the identity of the younger \"Antiochus 'Tony' Wilson\", an established visual artist. Arthur later discovers this identity has been taken from someone who recently died. Arthur is relocated by the Company into a community in Malibu, California, filled with people like him who are also \"reborns\". He attempts to assimilate into his new life, in which he is able to live as an artist —a career he had always aspired to— though he soon finds himself growing restless. While visiting the beach one day, Arthur encounters the freewheeling Nora Marcus. The two develop a swift attraction to each other, and Nora recounts how she came to leave her former life behind. One night, Arthur accompanies Nora to a Bacchanalia party in Santa Barbara. There, the revelers dance, sing, and stomp grapes in a large trough and, after some initial discomfort, Arthur lowers his inhibitions and begins to enjoy himself. Later, Arthur and Nora host a cocktail party for neighbors and other guests. Arthur gets drunk over the course of the night, and begins to speak openly to the other guests about his former identity, which is forbidden by the Company. Upon returning home, Arthur receives a phone call from Charlie, who warns him that he has put himself in danger by violating the Company's rules. Charlie also reveals that Nora is an employee of the Company who covertly oversees new \"reborns\" to assure they have a smooth transition. Disenchanted by his new contrived life, Arthur defiantly leaves California, and returns to New York. He arranges a meeting with Emily at his former home, claiming —as Tony— that he was once a friend of Arthur's. The two have a conversation in which Emily shares that she felt Arthur was emotionally disconnected from his life, and was in a constant state of longing that she could not understand. After the meeting, a melancholic Arthur is met by associates of the Company, and he requests that they give him a different identity. They agree to do so, but only if he can provide them with another referral to the Company. He tells them he does not know anyone he could proposition, and demands they carry out the transformation anyway. Returning to the headquarters, Arthur is placed in a waiting room with various other men, including his friend Charlie, all of whom have asked to undergo yet another 'rebirth'. An elated Charlie is chosen and is escorted from the waiting room. Frustrated at the unknown amount of time the men have been waiting to be chosen, and being unable to think of anyone that he can refer to the Company, Arthur angrily demands that his procedure is performed without further delay. Later, as Arthur is wheeled into the operating room, he is met by a chaplain who begins to read him his last rites. After being bound, gagged, and sedated, Arthur comes to realize he is about to be killed. Dr. Innes, who performed Arthur's original transformation, coldly laments to Arthur that he is sorry it has to end this way, and that Arthur's transformation into Tony was his \"best work\". He explains that Arthur's body will be used as the catalyst for another patient's transformation — the staged scene for that patient's faked death will be a car accident. Dr. Innes proceeds to drill into Arthur's skull to inflict a brain hemorrhage consistent with head injuries sustained in a car crash. As Arthur loses consciousness, he stares into the surgical light, and has a memory of seeing a man playing with his infant daughter on the beach; the image distorts and loses resolution as Arthur dies.",

    "Synopsis": "In the fictional Venetian town of Rezega, a group of merchants and professionals from the upper-middle class conceal a complex web of underlying mutual betrayals. Toni Gasparini, a charismatic playboy both admired and feared by friends, confides in Dr. Castellan, a friend and physician, admitting that he has been impotent for several months. This revelation is intended to make Castellan lower his guard regarding his young and lively wife, Noemi. Insensitively, the doctor spreads this confidential information among friends, purely for the pleasure of gossip, oblivious to the fact that he is inadvertently aiding Toni's scheme. Following a party, Castellan, along with others, continues the night of revelry at a nightclub, allowing Toni to accompany Noemi home. When a disbelieving friend, who had witnessed Gasparini's recent escapade about ten days prior, reveals this information, the doctor rushes home but arrives too late to prevent Noemi from being seduced. He is then compelled to conceal the incident to preserve his own honor. The historic phrase he utters while leaving the house is, \"and let it stay between us,\" underscoring the importance of not being perceived as a \"béco\" or \"cuckold\" in Venetian dialect (and in the northeast in general). Osvaldo Bisigato, an unassuming bank employee burdened by an oppressive and resentful wife, Gilda, who incessantly reproaches him for failures and a lack of ambition, believes he can embark on a new life by eloping with Milena Zulian, the young and beautiful cashier from the bar frequented by the group. However, while betrayal is tacitly tolerated, social norms reject separation, prompting the entire town to unite against him: Gilda's cousin (the influential Ippolita, Gasparini's wife), the so-called \"friends,\" the employer, the parish priest, and even the carabinieri commander. They all coerce him to reconsider and maintain the illusion of the sanctity of marital union. Don Schiavon convinces Milena to leave town, and Bisigato, after a suicide attempt and a stint in a clinic, returns submissive and resigned. Alda Cristofoletto, a young and beautiful country girl (characterized as white as milk and tough as marble by the shoe salesman Lino Benedetti), arrives in town for shopping and attracts the attention of a group of womanizers. However, the following day, Bepi Cristofoletto, the father of the sixteen-year-old girl, reports them all for corruption of a minor. To prevent the community from being tarnished by the trial's scandal, economic magnates and religious authorities silence the local press. Through a series of calls, they prompt the reporter Tosato to erase names until no culprits remain in the article. The cold and calculating Ippolita, the wife of one of the accused, convinces the naive and honest farmer Cristofoletto to withdraw the complaint. She offers him a substantial sum of money in return, satisfying her own carnal desires and securing a considerable portion of the funds collected for \"mediation,\" ostensibly intended for the poor.",

    "Synopsis": "thumb|Totò and [[Alfredo Bini on the set of The Hawks and the Sparrows]] Totò and his son Ninetto roam the neighbourhood and the countryside of Rome. During the walk they observe a body being removed from a house following a murder. They next encounter a talking crow, who is described in the intertitles thus: \"For the benefit of those who were not paying attention or are in doubt, we remind you that the Crow is – as you say – a left-wing intellectual of the kind found living before Palmiro Togliatti's death.\" The Crow subsequently recounts the tale of \"Fra Ciccillo\" and \"Fra Ninetto\" (still played by Totò and Ninetto), two Franciscan friars who are bid by St. Francis to preach the Gospel to the hawks (representing the powerful) and the sparrows (representing the weak). After many failures, they discover the language of birds and succeed in preaching the commandment of love unto the species separately, but are not able to get them to love each other. The hawks continue to kill and eat the sparrows, as it is in their nature. Saint Francis explains the relationship between the two groups to them from a Marxist perspective and invites them to continue proselytizing. After the tale, the journey of Totò and Ninetto carries on, with the Crow still accompanying them. They encounter other individuals: land-owners who order them off their land when they are caught defecating; a family living in absolute poverty, with no food and whom Totò threatens to drive out of the house if the rent is not paid; a group of travelling actors (representing figures marginalised from society such as women, gays, the elderly, racial minorities, and the disabled) who persuade the pair to push the group's Cadillac car for them; and a rich man who is waiting for Totò to give him the money he owes him (in contrast to the earlier episode where Toto had demanded rent). This is followed by news footage of the funeral of Palmiro Togliatti, the long-time leader of the Italian Communist Party. Finally, after having met a prostitute, the two end up killing and eating the Crow, whom they found to be unconscionably boring. Pasolini declared that Uccellacci e uccellini was his favourite film, as it was the only one that did not disappoint his expectations. Ennio Morricone's opening theme music features Domenico Modugno singing the movie's credits.",

    "film_title": "The Nun (1966 film)",
    "Synopsis": "Suzanne, a young woman in a wedding gown, prepares to take her vows of chastity, obedience, and poverty and make herself a nun. However, she refuses at the last moment and instead begs her parents not to force her to take them. This does not work, and later Suzanne learns much about her family and her heritage – or her lack thereof. She discovers that her mother's husband is not her father, and that her mother is shutting her up in the convent because she does not want her husband to know that the girl was not his daughter. She also does not want to see her sin in the flesh, for she says bearing the girl was her only sin. The father sends the priest to convince her, who reveals her heritage, but it fell on deaf ears. Later the mother falls on her knees to beg the daughter to take the vows, explaining the story enough to make Suzanne resign herself to her fate, realizing that her mother would never give her a chance to marry because the mother did not feel she was worthy to marry and the family could not afford to marry her off. According to the mother, she did not have the bloodline to marry. She writes her mother a letter that says she will take the vows, a letter that will later be used against her in the court case she wages against the church to be released of her vows. Suzanne allows herself to be dressed in a wedding gown and takes the vows. She enters the convent, extremely depressed and unresponsive, unable to cope with the requirements of being a nun. She bonds to the Mother Superior, who takes her under her wing, and they have many long conversations. The Mother Superior, Mme de Moni, knows it is a mistake to accept the girl as a nun but does not stop it, instead telling the girl to accept her fate and make the best of it. Suzanne attempts to, which is made easier by Mme de Moni's encouragement, and does not utter more words but her body language reveals all. During this time, Suzanne's mother dies, and Mme de Moni does as well. She bears it until the life finally drives her mad, for the new Mother Superior, Sister Sainte-Christine, mistreats her because of her rebellion as a result of her dislike of the nun's life. She isolates her constantly and deprives her of food, forcing her to adopt a diet of bread and water. Suzanne then sends her friend away with a letter to a lawyer. She wants to be free and absolved of her vows under the argument that everyone around her forced her to take the vows against her will: her mother, her father, the Mother Superior, etc. The lawyer, who becomes her biggest advocate against the religious orthodoxy enslaving her, informs her that while the case is pending, she will have to stay with Sister Sainte-Christine and endure the resulting persecution, but that either she will win or be transferred. Suzanne does not care, not truly understanding the depths of Sister Sainte-Christine' cruelty. While the case pends, Suzanne suffers many mistreatments under Sister Sainte-Christine, who steals her crucifix, forbids her to eat, forbids her to pray, forbids the other sisters to interact with or speak to her, and isolates her. She allows them to walk on the weakened, starving Suzanne after Mass. She is also whipped. They become convinced she is possessed, and Sister Sainte-Christine requests an exorcist. Officials arrive, see her mistreatment and understand that her devotion to God is not the way a possessed person would act, and investigate the mistreatment, which involves Sister Sainte-Christine's being reprimanded. After that, Sister Sainte-Christine lessens the punishment to only isolation but still treats her coldly. When Suzanne discovers that the church has decided not to absolve her vows, she once again falls into a severe depression. Her lawyer apologizes and promises to keep in touch, although a church official forbids the contact. The same man later tells her that the church transferred her to another convent under the supervision of Mme de Chelles. In addition to long conversations about her thoughts and experiences, the light-hearted, fun, happy Mme de Chelles displays an attraction to and makes sexual advances towards Suzanne, which Suzanne never fully grasps. She meets a monk who attempts to comfort her by saying that he was forced into religion against his will as well. They develop a relationship and he later tells her that they must escape together. Suzanne goes with him, but flees from him when he forces kisses on her as soon as they are together which implies he desires more with her. Suzanne finds refuge nearby, working as a seamstress and doing chores for women. While there, she learns that the monk was caught and faces life in prison, same as she does. She cannot bear the thought of returning. She flees the small village she has taken refuge in and winds up begging on the street. A smart looking woman takes her to her home, but Suzanne does not understand it is a brothel and joins the girls who are dressing to entertain clients at a masked dinner party. As everybody takes their places, Suzanne realises what is involved. Crossing to the window, she asks God's forgiveness and jumps to her death.",

    "Synopsis": "Following the quelling of Lajos Kossuth's 1848 revolution against Habsburg rule in Hungary, prison camps were set up for people suspected of being Kossuth's supporters. Around 20 years later, some members of highwayman Sándor Rózsa's guerrilla band, believed to be some of Kossuth's last supporters, are known to be interned among the prisoners in a camp. The prison staff try to identify the rebels and find out if Sándor is among them using various means of mental and physical torture and trickery. When one of the guerrillas, János Gajdar, is identified as a murderer by an old woman, he starts aiding his captors by acting as an informant. Gajdar is told that if he can show his captors a man who has killed more people than himself, he will be spared. Fearing for his life, he turns in several people his captors have been looking for by name but unable to identify among the prisoners. Eventually Gajdar becomes an outcast among the prisoners, and is murdered at night by some of his fellow inmates while in solitary confinement. The prison guards easily discover suspects, people whose cells had been left unlocked for the night, and start interrogating them in the hope of finding Sándor himself. The suspects are tricked into revealing the remaining guerrillas when they are given a chance to form a new military unit out of former bandits and informed that Sándor, who was not among the prisoners, has been pardoned. However, the celebrating guerrillas are then told that those who previously fought under him will still face execution.",

    "Synopsis": "At the beginning of the 20th century, Thomas Törless arrives at the academy and learns how Anselm von Basini has been caught stealing by fellow student Reiting. Basini is obliged to become Reiting's \"slave\", bowing to Reiting's sadistic rituals, and being repeatedly tortured and sexually abused by him and another student, Beineberg. Törless follows their relationship with intellectual interest but without emotional involvement. Beineberg also takes Törless along to visit Bozena, the local prostitute, who is the mother of an infant born after she was impregnated and abandoned by an employer when she was working as a servant for an aristocratic family. Again, Törless is aloof and more intrigued than excited by the woman. He is however very eager to understand imaginary numbers, which are mentioned in his maths lesson. The maths teacher is unwilling or unable to explain what these are, stating that in life, emotion is what rules everything as even mathematics. After Basini is humiliated and suspended upside down in the school gym because of one of Reiting's intrigues, Törless realises intellectually that the other boys are simply cruel. He seems no more or less emotionally moved by this than by the revelation that he cannot understand imaginary numbers. He decides that he does not want to partake in cruelty, so decides to leave the academy. His teachers think that he is too \"highly strung\" for his own good, and do not want him to stay anyway as they are part of the system which can allow such terrible things to be done to the weak and vulnerable. At the end of the film, Törless is dismissed from the school and leaves with his mother, smiling.",

Stephen, a married Oxford tutor in his forties, has two students: the rich and likeable William, of whom he is fond, and a beautiful, enigmatic Austrian named Anna, whom he secretly desires. William also fancies Anna and hopes to know her better. While Stephen's wife is away having their third child, he looks up an old flame in London and they sleep together. Returning home, he finds that his pushy colleague Charley has been using the house for sex with Anna. She tells Stephen privately that she and William are engaged to be married. William says that he will go to Stephen's house after a party that night. As he is too drunk to drive, Anna takes the wheel, but she crashes the car outside Stephen's gate. Upon finding the accident and William dead, Stephen pulls the deeply shaken Anna from the wreckage and hides her upstairs while he calls the police. Later, he forces himself on her while she is still in shock, then takes her back to her room at the university.

    "Synopsis": "thumb|Vanessa Redgrave and David Hemmings 1966 After spending the night at a doss house, where he has taken pictures for a book of art photographs, photographer Thomas is late for a photo shoot with model Veruschka at his studio, which in turn makes him late for a shoot with other models later in the morning. He grows bored and frustrated with the models and walks off, leaving them and the production staff in the lurch. As he leaves the studio, two teenage aspiring models ask to speak to him, but he brushes them off and drives off to visit an antique shop near Maryon Park. Wandering into the park, Thomas furtively takes photographs of two lovers, an older man in his 60s and a lady in her 30s. He follows them in a secluded area in the park. Then, he leaves, but the woman, Jane, is furious at being photographed and pursues Thomas, demanding his film and attempting to take his camera. He refuses, and continues to photograph her as she runs away. Thomas then meets his agent Ron for lunch and notices a man following him and looking into his car. Thomas returns to his studio to find Jane, who asks desperately for the film. They have a conversation and flirt, but he deliberately hands her a different roll of film. She, in turn, gives him a false telephone number. Thomas makes several blow-ups of the film of Jane and her lover, which reveal Jane appearing to look worriedly at a person lurking in the trees with a pistol. Thomas excitedly calls Ron, claiming that his impromptu photo session may have saved a man's life. He is then disturbed by a knock on the door from the teenage girls. They have a sexual encounter in the studio before he falls asleep. After awakening, he learns that the girls hope he will photograph them, but is distracted by a detail in one of his blow-ups. He tells them to leave, saying, \"Tomorrow! Tomorrow!\" Thomas examines a blurred figure on the ground under a bush in the blow-up, which he suspects is the dead body of a man shot by the gunman. As evening falls, he goes back to the park without his camera and finds the body, but is scared off by the sound of a twig breaking. He returns to his studio to find it ransacked, with all of the negatives and prints gone except for one very grainy blow-up of what is possibly the body. After driving into town, he sees Jane and follows her into the Ricky-Tick club, where the Yardbirds are performing the song \"Stroll On\". A buzzing noise in guitarist Jeff Beck's amplifier angers him so much that he smashes his guitar and throws its neck into the crowd. The crowd, previously disengaged, fights over the guitar neck. Thomas grabs the neck and runs out of the club, with much of the crowd chasing after him; once he is away from the crowd, he tosses the neck away and walks on. A passer-by picks up the neck and examines it, but also discards it. At a drug-drenched party in a house on the Thames, Thomas asks a cannabis-addled Ron to come to the park as a witness, but cannot convince him of what has happened. Instead, Thomas joins the party at Ron's insistence and wakes up in the house at sunrise. He then returns to the park alone, only to find that the body is gone. Thomas watches a mime troupe perform a mock-tennis match at the park, and picks up the imaginary ball and throws it back to the two players when asked. As he watches the mimes continue to play, the sound of the ball being played is heard. His image then fades away, leaving only the grass.",

    "Synopsis": "In the summer of 1889, tightrope walker Hedvig Jensen and Swedish lieutenant Sixten Sparre are in the Danish countryside, having run away together. They are both fleeing their past lives—Sparre from the military and his wife and children, Hedvig from the traveling circus at which she is the star attraction—to be together. The couple are keeping their whereabouts private due to the scorn their scandalous relationship incurs, as well as to evade Sparre's regiment, who are in search of the deserter. Hedvig feels she has reclaimed her identity with Sparre and asks him to call her by her real name instead of her stage name, Elvira Madigan. Despite the couple hiding their identities at a hotel, they are found out when authorities find the buttons on Sparre’s military uniform discarded in a field. A kindly hotel cook helps the couple to sneak away before they can be apprehended. Kristoffer, a friend from Sparre's regiment, manages to locate the couple. He tries to persuade Sparre to come back, but Sparre insists he is a changed man due to Hedvig’s influence and is now \"on the women's side\", embracing more idealistic views and no longer taking pride in military matters. Kristoffer makes a last-ditch effort to get Sparre to return by telling him his wife attempted suicide, but Sparre believes this to be a lie to break up his relationship with Hedvig. He renounces his friend and continues on with Hedvig. The couple resume their idyllic summer staying at various hotels and inns, but as their financial resources dwindle, they find themselves having to procure money wherever they can. Sparre wins money by gambling, while Hedvig gets paid to entertain a party with her dancing and sells a picture of herself drawn by Toulouse-Lautrec. She suggests Sparre look for a job, but he claims as a deserter, he would not be able to find work. The couple have an argument over the realities of their precarious situation. Sparre apologizes to Hedvig and the two reconcile. However, they have gone days without eating. Having mutually agreed on a suicide pact, they set out for one last picnic together, with Sparre packing a gun in the basket. After an emotional moment together, Sparre attempts to shoot Hedvig, but he cannot bring himself to do it. Later, as Hedvig chases a butterfly in the fields, smiling as she did in the early days of their romance, Sparre musters the will to honor the pact. He shoots her dead and then kills himself. The deaths take place offscreen and only the gunshots are heard.",

    "Synopsis": "The story is told in flashback by a writer who explains how he got into his present situation. He had been supporting a conservative party leader, but then decided to support the liberal candidate. The liberal wins the election, but soon reneges upon his campaign promises. The disillusioned writer decides to stay out of politics and resume his writing. Unfortunately, his girlfriend convinces him to try to talk the country's leader into pursuing a particular direction. The writer is soon shot. In the Republic of Eldorado, Paulo Martins is an idealist journalist and poet linked to the rising conservative politician and technocrat Porfírio Diaz and his mistress, Sílvia, with whom they form a love triangle. When Diaz is elected senator, Paulo moves away and goes to the province of Alecrim, where he associates with the activist Sara. Together they resolve to support the populist alderman Felipe Vieira for governor in an attempt to launch a new, supposedly progressive political leader who will guide the change of the situation of misery and injustice that plagues the country. After winning the election, Vieira appears weak and controlled by the local economic forces that financed him and does little to change the social situation, which leads Paulo, disillusioned, to leave Sara and return to the capital and meet Sílvia again. He approaches Júlio Fuentes, the country's biggest businessman, and tells him that President Fernandez has the economic support of a powerful multinational, EXPLINT (Company of International Exploitation), that wants to take control of the capital. When Diaz goes to the presidential race with the support of Fernandez, Fuentes' television channel supports Paulo, who uses it in order to attack Diaz. Vieira and Paulo join the presidential campaign again until Fuentes betrays them both and makes an agreement with Diaz. Paulo wants to start the armed struggle, but Vieira gives up.",

Andrew, the elder, apparently reacts with adult maturity to the loss of his mother, looking after little Miles in an attempt to find a way out of his early heart-crushing loss. Miles constantly blames Andrew for his own mischievous behavior, but his brother valiantly takes said blame, as his personality is that of a grown up, or at least that is what he tries to be. Because of the demands of his career, the father is often absent, both physically and emotionally, especially toward Andrew. It will be at the end that Duncombe will acknowledge his mistakes when finding himself at a father's point of no return.",

    "Synopsis": "Mouchette, whose name means \"little fly\", lives in an isolated French village with her father and bedridden, dying mother, taking care of her infant brother and doing all the housework. She is ostracised at school for her bedraggled clothes and chastised by her teacher for refusing to sing. Once, in contrast to the misery of her daily life, Mouchette goes to a fair, where a kind woman buys Mouchette a token so she can ride on the bumper cars. She and a young man bump into each other's cars as a mutual flirtation. Before she can speak to the boy after the ride, her father takes Mouchette away. Walking home from school one day, Mouchette gets lost in the woods when a rainstorm begins. Arsène, an alcoholic epileptic poacher, stumbles upon her and takes her to his hut. He fears he has killed a man with whom he had fought earlier, and attempts to use Mouchette as an alibi to clear him of the blame. He suffers a seizure, and she tends to him gently. When he comes to, she admits seeing him wound and possibly kill the gamekeeper, and she pushes him to get out of the hut, but Arsène captures her and rapes her. By early morning, Mouchette has escaped. Returning home, she feeds her crying hungry baby brother with a bottle of milk, then changes his nappy, as her weak bedbound mother instructs. She tries to sleep but awakens, crying. Her baby brother wakes up crying again, so she tries to soothe him in her arms. Her mother requests a bottle of gin to die without pain. She tries to talk to her mother but finds her dead. Her verbally-abusive father returns. On her way to get milk, a shopkeeper offers her a free coffee and croissant. The shopkeeper notices a scratch on Mouchette’s chest and when Mouchette accidentally breaks the coffee bowl, calls her a \"little slut\". Elderly women dressed in black are going to church. Later, when talking to the gamekeeper Mathieu and his wife about the events of the previous night in the woods, she tries to offer the story agreed with Arsène. Reluctantly, she states that she was at Arsène's house through the night because he is her lover. Finally, she is invited into the house of an elderly woman, who gives her a dress to wear at the funeral and a shroud to cover her mother. The woman speaks to her about worshipping the dead and gives Mouchette three nice dresses that will fit. On her way out, Mouchette insults her and stains her carpet. Mouchette then witnesses hunters shooting and killing rabbits. Another rabbit is wounded and cannot hop. Mouchette looks shocked by the horror she witnesses. She clutches one of the dresses by the river then rolls down a hill with it. She continues to roll down the hill several times, her clothes soiling, until she splashes into the river, and does not return.",

    "film_title": "Ten Thousand Days (film)",
    "Synopsis": "During the second wave of collectivization in Hungary of the 1960's where the István Széles and his wife (Tibor Molnár) live. Their son is about to go abroad, to the sea. Before his trip, his father tells him that he recently tried to commit suicide. The story jumps back in time about ten thousand days, to the 1930s, and from there it tells the story of István Széles, Juli (Gyöngyi Bürös) and Fülöp Bánó (János Koltai) with smaller and larger time jumps. István, the aging farmer, marries Juli, who works as a servant for farmer Balogh, and then they choose the leftist Fülöp Bánó as the godfather of their child together. One New Year's Eve, István blows the roof of farmer Balogh's pigpen into the house, and István has to get down on his knees and apologize to the pig, whose little ones have frozen. The drunken Fülöp attacks his friend with a knife because of his servility, and his wife also gets involved in the fight. The couple then vows never to hit each other again. Later, Fülöp apologizes to István, but during the cubicle[landless peasant workers] strike, they come face to face again. István and Mihály Csere want to break the strike because they are starving and would take on work for half a penny. In the brick factory, the workers, including Fülöp, beat him and tie the “traitors” to the wheelbarrow. Later, István hits his wife again when she tries to buy a horse from traveling vendors, but Juli is unable to sell their ox. Before the war, Mama Széles sprinkles salt on the land – which the Széles couple plowed with their own power – ehat is a kinf of magic so that the war will not reach their house. During the recruitment at the barracks, István lies that he has eight children, so they don't take him as a soldier, unlike Fülöp, who had four children. After the second world war, Fülöp returns to the village as a Communist agitator, and the big estate lands were distributed[the Communist did it at the beginning but later coerced the peasants(, kulaks) to join the community land companies=Agricultural service cooperatives or kolhoz in Russian]. The peasants, interpreting the idea of common property in their own way, immediately loot the granary, and Fülöp can barely stop them. We get a glimpse of the more cheerful side of the Rákosi era in the context of a May Day festival, and then, as a contrast, the scene in which a significant part of the grains harvested by István and his family is forcibly collected by the authority[to feed the urban areas]. Fülöp tries to make István understand why it is important to give their crops to the commons, but in the evening István and Mihály steal back their own share. The two men end up at the police station, and Mihály almost strangles the policeman (his brother-in-law), who manages to shoot the big man at the last moment. Since István did nothing to stop the fight, he is deported to a labor camp for 852 days around 1951–52 for complicity. Thanks to a prisoner, József Bócza, Juli is able to visit István, who tells her husband everything that has happened in recent years, including how Fülöp helped their son get into university. In 1956, the revolution broke out. A gang of \"counter-revolutionist\" with weapons put Fülöp Bánó, the policeman, and two other communists in the lake to be executed. The leader of the revolutionaries asks István for advice on how to humiliate the communists. István replies that they respect each other. “He said this revolution is ours. The one with the gun is right. […] Strangers have never come to this village to hoe. They always come to take action,” he says. The revolutionary hands over the machine gun to István, but the man does not shoot any of them. The \"counter-revolutionaries\" then take the four men to the church, warning the villagers that anyone who dares to defend them will be shot. The leader makes the communists kneel against the wall, but Fülöp does not kneel or turn his back on him. Finally, the man executes everyone except Fülöp and leaves the village with the \"counter-revolutionaries\". István, lying that Juli is dying, sends a letter to his son, who, ashamed at home, vows not to return to university to study. In the summer, while picking potatoes, Juli falls ill in the scorching sun, and Pista almost hits his father with a hoe. He talks about his feelings with Fülöp, who tells him that he has wanted a cooperative[Agricultural service cooperatives] union for 15 years because \"this dirty land is making everyone stupid\". Pista urges him to make it happen, to do something. Finally, he talks to his father, who threatens to strangle him if he doesn't go back to university. Influenced by Fülöp, István tries to persuade the other farmers to join the union, who don't want to hand over their land, so he backs down too. István visits his son in Budapest, who is also in favor of union. Fülöp finally convinces István by calling him a coward and by arguing that union would create a world \"where things are not important, but people\". István signs the paper necessary for union and then hangs himself. István survives, and the film returns to the present. The film ends with Pista's[István's son] narration, who finally reaches the sea, in which he talks about how the land is not as important to him as it was to his ancestors, because he feels that all land is his own.",

    "Synopsis": "The death threats against the local pharmacist Arturo Manno do not surprise any of his friends because he is a known womanizer in his small town. They do not take his reports seriously until Manno, together with his friend Antonio Roscio, is killed while hunting one early morning. Suspicion falls on the father and two brothers of the Manno's underage servant Rosina, with whom Manno had an affair. Professor Laurana, who had seen one of the extortion letters, does not believe in the guilt of these illiterate men since the letters had been made with clippings from the Osservatore Romano, a Vatican newspaper with only two local subscribers. Laurana asks his lawyer friend Rosello to take care of the prisoners, and begins his own research, also motivated by his secret love for Luisa Roscio, the widow of Manno's murdered companion. Roscio's father, who had been against his son's marriage to Luisa from the beginning, hands him over Roscio's diary, which has pages missing. From a friend and member of the Palermo city council, Laurana learns that Roscio had been fearing for his life because he was collecting evidence against a corrupt prominent citizen from Laurana's hometown. Roscio had been convinced that the death threats against Manno were a cover-up and that Roscio himself was actually the person in danger. Luisa, who rejects Laurana's advances but seemingly supports his research, tells him that she suspects her cousin Rosello to be involved in the case. Laurana meets with Rosello, who takes him in his car to a mysterious appointment. Laurana, who realises that his own life is in danger now, pretends that he has left a diary with the details of his research in Palermo. The angry Rosello takes him back to the village and throws him out of the car. The next day, Laurana tells Luisa that he had only been bluffing and that his alleged diary doesn't exist. Luisa takes him to a place by the seaside, where she leaves him after again rejecting his blunt advances. A group of local men beats up Laurana, kills him and lets his body disappear. Some time later, Rosello and Luisa marry, watched by Rosello's and Laurana's acquaintances, who comment disparagingly on the scheme but also on Laurana's naivety.",

    "film_title": "You're a Big Boy Now",
    "Synopsis": "Nineteen year old Bernard Chanticleer, called \"Big Boy\" by his parents, lives in Great Neck, New York with his overbearing, clinging mother and his commanding, disapproving father, who is curator of incunabula at the New York Public Library. Bernard works at the library as a low-level assistant. His father, who constantly monitors and admonishes him, decides Bernard is old enough to move out and into his own Manhattan apartment. His unhappy mother acquiesces to her husband's decision and arranges for Bernard to live in a rooming house run by nosy, prudish Miss Nora Thing. Miss Thing inherited the building on the condition that her late brother's aggressive pet rooster be allowed to occupy the fifth floor, which Bernard must pass to get to his room. Miss Thing reassures Bernard's mother that the rooster only attacks young, attractive women. Mrs. Chanticleer says her son is still uninterested in girls, but arranges with Miss Thing to report any \"female\" activity. Bernard's mother constantly mails locks of her hair to Bernard at his new residence. Actually, Bernard is very interested in girls, but he is a naive, immature virgin. He is smitten from afar with the coldly beautiful actress Barbara Darling. Meanwhile, Amy Partlett, Bernard's grade-school classmate who now works in his father's office, confesses to Bernard that she has a crush on him. Bernard's worldly co-worker Raef Del Grado encourages him to date Amy because she's a \"sure thing\" (a girl that will sleep with him) and discourages him from trying to pursue Barbara. Bernard and Amy go on a date to a discotheque, but when Bernard sees Barbara performing as the featured go-go dancer, he is mesmerized by her and loses all interest in Amy. Amy tries to win him back by offering to spend the night with him and Bernard accepts, though he's thinking of Barbara the entire time. When they try to go to Bernard's room, the rooster attacks Amy, causing a commotion during which Miss Thing falls down the stairs and breaks her arm. Bernard's mother blames Amy, calling her a tramp and forbidding Bernard from seeing her again. Bernard and his parents attend a play in which Barbara is acting. Bernard later writes her a gushing fan letter. She responds with an invitation to visit her in her dressing room after a future performance. Unaware that Barbara is a man-hating narcissist after being sexually assaulted as a young girl, Bernard rushes to the theater. He then bumbles his way through an evening at her apartment. Barbara, knowing she has control over Bernard, tries to seduce him, but he is unable to perform sexually. Bernard is upset, even though Barbara acts understanding. Miss Thing tells Bernard's father that Bernard was out all night and that Amy called looking for him every 15 minutes while he was gone. Miss Thing and Bernard's father accidentally get trapped in a timelocked vault full of rare erotica, which horrifies her and causes her to rush out in disarray when the vault opens, giving the impression that Bernard's father made a pass at her. While this is going on, Amy tells Bernard that his father has, in fact, made a pass at her. Barbara invites Bernard to move in with her, which is convenient for him, since he finds out when he goes to pack his things that Miss Thing has just evicted him. Barbara kicks him out when he gets to her apartment, only to call him back again, and, with nowhere else to go, Bernard returns to her. He still finds himself unable to perform with her, and by this point he's so confused that he even asks her to marry him, an offer that neither of the two seems to take very seriously. When Bernard returns to Barbara's apartment after walking his dog and discovers Raef there, in a bathrobe (Bernard's father has sent Raef to find Bernard), he gathers up his things and moves out. Bernard returns to the library, where Amy and his parents have been discussing the situation and debating how to go about searching for Bernard. He tells his parents he's leaving right away to get away from them. Barbara and Raef arrive with Bernard's dog and reveal they have become engaged. Miss Thing and her new boyfriend, police officer Francis Graf, who lives in her boarding house, also arrive to confront Bernard's father about what happened in the vault. After some shouting, Bernard grabs his father's most prized library item, a Gutenberg Bible, and runs away with it. A slapstick chase through a street parade and a department store follows, ending when Barbara knocks Bernard out with a mannequin's leg. Barbara is featured in the newspaper for stopping a rare book thief and saving the Gutenberg Bible for the City of New York. Elated with her newfound fame, she dumps Raef. Bernard is jailed for his attempted \"theft\", but Amy bails him out. He realizes she's the girl for him, and they leave together.",

    "film_title": "All My Good Countrymen",
    "Synopsis": "The film begins in 1945 and traces the seasonal or annual changes that a small Moravian village undergoes until the Epilogue, which is sometime after 1958. The first part of the film set in 1945 establishes the innocence and camaraderie of a village amidst the backdrop of a post-War landscape. Children play with guns and a land mine is discovered while ploughing the fields. A group of villagers detonate it and end the night dancing and drinking in the local pub. They leave at dawn as the sun rises on a beautiful, idyllic landscape and stop to sleep beneath a tree after taking in the view. In 1948, it is just months after the Communists have taken power in February. Loud speakers blare propaganda and announce rations while the farmer František works. We discover that four of the main villagers have converted, namely, the organist Očenáš, the photographer Plecmera, the postman Bertin, and Zejvala. The townspeople disdain them. A landowner must vacate his land so it can become a collective; his wife tearfully removes pictures of Jesus and the Virgin Mary from the walls as the landowner criticizes: \"I hope you look after this place, your own looks like a pigsty.\" To which the communists respond ominously: \"Don't worry! We will show you what we can do!\" The communists greedily inspect their winnings (animals, house, a stockpile of wood) and begin to loot for themselves. Meanwhile, a tailor sets up shop with his wife and the help of friends, who warn him that the communists will put an end to his good fortunes. Indeed, a group of communists come and demand he turn over the property on which he has just spent his life's savings and lead a tailoring collective instead. In 1949 the postman, Bertin, is shot after we see him and his wife-to-be, Machačová, being fitted for wedding clothes. A funeral is held after which police arrest those they deem responsible. František the noble farmer leads a mass of townspeople to demand the police turn over some of the wrongly accused perpetrators, namely the priest. The organist Očenáš, facing death threats, leaves at his wife's persistence. The photographer's wife, aspiring for status and a new house, implores her husband to fill the position left behind by Očenáš. In 1951, Zášinek comes home drunk from a night at the bar. He hallucinates the ghost of his ex-wife, a Jew. He had divorced her because he feared the Germans and she had died in a concentration camp. Her ghost tells him that she has forgiven him. Nevertheless, his guilt drives him mad. He sees her again at an afternoon soiree and dances with her briefly. Meanwhile, Machačová, \"the merry widow,\" shows up to the same soiree with the town thief, Jořka. He has been summoned to prison a few days prior and we understand that he is to report that afternoon. After dancing, he bids her farewell and walks off, presumably toward the prison. He stops and pours acid on his left foot, which starts to hiss and boil. He returns a clock he had stolen, repaired, to its rightful owner, then collapses from his wound and dies as white goose down covers him like snow. In Autumn 1951, Zášinek is still upset about his guilt. He visits the church to confess. He is shown later at a pub amidst friends and the merry widow. They dine and soon begin to dance, all while being painted. The painting shifts from formless shapes to lackluster diners to a frenzied dance, with Zášinek soon depicted as a devil with a skull. He returns home the next morning drunk and is impaled by a loose bull and dies. In 1952, František's weary father comments on how his strength is failing with age. At a townhall meeting, the communists announce they will take more loans; the panel clap for each other. The audience does not clap; František speaks against the decision and leads away the villagers. The communists seek to destroy him, for \"as long as he is around, nothing will get done.\" He is arrested; police attempt to get others to sign statements alleging his guilt but with no immediate success—the villagers hold out until they are threatened. In 1954, A communist who had stolen from the original confiscated house returns. He is called a disgrace and dismissed. František has escaped from prison but he is sick and near death. In 1955, František's health rebounds. He no longer has anything but buys a horse and sets to work again. The narrator asks, \"which can bear more, a man or a horse? A man, because he has to.\" In 1957, Realizing that the village rallies around the noble František, the communists ask him to persuade the others to declare their harvests. František refuses. After being forced, all villagers sign except Frantisek. In 1958, František is taken to the home originally seized from the landowner. It has been poorly taken care of; he agrees to take it on and become the collective's leader. On his way to assume the role, he and his daughter's carriage are stopped by a carnival procession of villagers masked with the heads of animals and monsters. They are gentle to him and he laughs as he continues. The mob moves next to an oncoming car. It is the photographer and his wife. They stop it, pull them out and dance. The photographer's merriment is cut short as he clutches his chest and falls to the snow with a heart attack. Later the townspeople amassed at the pub remove their animal masks and remark: \"soon all the people will be gone and all that will be left are the animals.\" In the Epilogue, Očenáš returns to the village. He runs into the now-blind and divorced photographer who has tumbled from power. Očenáš asks about František, who he discovers has recently died. The photographer remarks: \"the best people go and the blackguards stay.\" Očenáš visits František's family and speaks with his daughters, who tell him the farmer's last words were to \"listen to the workers in the fields\"-- \"things will be better when they begin to sing again.\" Očenáš departs on his bike and looks back forlornly on the countryside as he laments: \"We have made our beds and now we have to lie in them. But have we made them ourselves? What have we done, rather, what have we undone, all my fellow countrymen?\"",

    "Synopsis": "After the World War II, in the Brazilian sertão. A group of impoverished peasant mystics (beatos) gathered around Dona Santa (Rosa Maria Penna), a female spiritual figure, join in veneration of Saint George with an obscure figure named Coirana (Lorival Pariz). Coirana claims to have restarted the cangaço and seeks to take the revenge of Lampião and other cangaceiro martyrs, presenting the tale of Saint George and the Dragon in a contemporary class conflict context. They threaten the town of Jardim de Piranhas governed by Coronel Horácio (Joffre Soares) a blind and old cattle owner married to younger and attractive Laura (Odete Lara). Dr. Mattos (Hugo Carvana), the corrupt police chief of the town, hires Antônio das Mortes as a jagunço against Coirana and Antônio fatally wounds Coirana in a duel. However, Antônio is changed by his experiences with the poor, and so he then demands that the coronel distribute the food stored in a warehouse to the remaining cangaceiros. The colonel raged and sent Mata Vaca (Vinícius Salvatori) to kill Antônio das Mortes. But Antônio das Mortes with the help of his friend \"Professor\" (Othon Bastos) kills Mata Vaca and his jagunços. The coronel is killed by Antão (Mário Gusmão), the helper and possibly lover of Dona Santa in a scene reminiscent of Saint George slaying the Dragon iconography. The movie ends with Antônio das Mortes walking by the roadside, carrying on the struggle - in some ways hopeless or unending - which extends beyond the killing of the colonel and the expropriation of his land.",

    "film_title": "Easy Rider",
    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. --> Wyatt and Billy are freewheeling motorcyclists. After smuggling cocaine from Mexico to Los Angeles, they sell their haul and receive a large sum of money. With the cash stuffed into a plastic tube hidden inside the Stars & Stripes–painted fuel tank of Wyatt's California-style chopper (motorcycle), they ride eastward, aiming to reach New Orleans in time for the Mardi Gras festival. During their trip, Wyatt and Billy stop to repair a flat tire on Wyatt's bike at a farmstead in Arizona and have a meal with the farmer and his family. Later, Wyatt picks up a hippie hitch-hiker, and he invites them to visit his commune, where they stay for the rest of the day. The notion of \"free love\" appears to be practiced, with two of the women, Lisa and Sarah, seemingly sharing the affections of the hitch-hiking commune member before turning their attention to Wyatt and Billy. As the bikers leave, the hitch-hiker gives Wyatt some LSD for him to share with \"the right people, at the right time\". Later while riding along with a parade in New Mexico, the pair are arrested for \"parading without a permit\" and thrown in jail. There, they befriend lawyer George Hanson, who has spent the night in jail after overindulging in alcohol. After mentioning having done work for the ACLU along with other conversation, George helps them get out of jail and decides to travel with Wyatt and Billy to New Orleans. As they camp that night, Wyatt and Billy introduce George to marijuana. As an alcoholic and a \"square\", George is reluctant to try it due to his fear of becoming \"hooked\" and it leading to worse drugs, but quickly relents. Stopping to eat at a small-town Louisiana diner, the trio attracts the attention of the locals. The girls in the restaurant think they are exciting, but the local men and a police officer make denigrating comments and taunts. Wyatt, Billy, and George decide to leave without any fuss. They make camp outside town. In the middle of the night, a group of locals attack the sleeping trio, beating them with clubs. Billy screams and brandishes a knife, and the attackers leave. Wyatt and Billy suffer minor injuries, but George has been bludgeoned to death. Wyatt and Billy wrap George's body in his sleeping bag, gather his belongings, and vow to return the items to his family. They continue to New Orleans and find a brothel George had told them about earlier. Taking prostitutes Karen and Mary with them, Wyatt and Billy wander the parade-filled streets of the Mardi Gras celebration. They end up in a French Quarter cemetery, where all four ingest the LSD the hitch-hiker had given to Wyatt. Later at their campsite, while Billy enthusiastically recounts their travels, Wyatt melancholically muses that they \"blew it\" in their quest. The next morning, as they are overtaken on a two-lane country road by two local men in an older pickup truck, the passenger in the truck reaches for a shotgun, saying he will scare them. As they pass Billy, the passenger fires, and Billy has a lowside crash. The truck passes Wyatt, who has stopped, and Wyatt rides back to Billy, finding him lying flat on the side of the road and covered in blood. Wyatt tells Billy he is going to get help and covers Billy's wound with his own leather jacket. Wyatt then rides down the road toward the pickup as it makes a U-turn. Passing in the opposite direction, the passenger fires the shotgun again, this time through the driver's-side window. Wyatt's riderless motorcycle flies through the air and comes apart before landing and being engulfed in flames.",

    "Synopsis": "The pupils return after the summer for a new Michaelmas term at a traditional British public school for boys in the late 1960s. Mick Travis arrives hiding his moustache, which he quickly shaves off. He, Wallace, and Knightly are three non-conformist boys in the lower sixth form, their penultimate year. They are watched and persecuted by the \"Whips\", upper sixth-formers given authority as prefects over the other boys. The junior boys are made to act as personal servants for the Whips, who discuss them as sex objects. The headmaster is remote from the boys and the housemasters. The protagonists' housemaster, Mr. Kemp, is easily manipulated by the Whips into giving them free rein in enforcing discipline. Some schoolmasters are shown behaving bizarrely. Mick and Johnny sneak off the school grounds and steal a motorbike from a showroom. They ride to a café staffed by an unnamed girl, about whom Mick fantasizes wrestling naked. Meanwhile, Wallace spends time with a younger boy, Bobby Philips, and later shares his bed. The three boys drink vodka in their study and consider how one man holds the potential to \"change the world with a bullet in the right place.\" Their clashes with school authorities become increasingly contentious. Eventually, a brutal caning by the Whips spurs them to action. During a school Combined Cadet Force military drill, Mick acquires live ammunition, which he, Wallace, and Knightly use to open fire on a group of boys and masters, including Kemp and the school chaplain. When the latter orders the boys to drop their weapons, Mick assaults him and cows him into submission. As punishment for their actions, the trio are ordered by the headmaster to clean out a large storeroom beneath the main school hall. They discover a cache of firearms, including automatic weapons and mortars. Joined by Philips and the girl from the café, they commit to revolt against the establishment. On Founders' Day, when parents are visiting the school, the group starts a fire under the hall, smoking everyone out of the building. They then open fire on them from the rooftop. Led by a visiting general who had been giving a speech, the staff, students, and parents break open the Combined Cadet Force armoury and begin firing back. The headmaster tries to stop the fight, imploring the group to listen to reason. The girl shoots him between the eyes. The battle continues, and the camera closes in on Mick's face as he keeps firing.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1927, Isadora Duncan has become a legend as the innovator of modern dance, a temperamental bohemian, and an outspoken advocate of free love. Now past 40, she lives in poverty in a small hotel on the French Riviera with her companion Mary Estelle Dempsey/Mary Desti (named only as Mary in the film) and her secretary Roger, to whom she is dictating her memoirs. As a young girl in California, Isadora first demonstrates her disdain for accepted social standards by burning her parents' marriage certificate and pledging her dedication to the pursuit of art and beauty. In 1896, she performs under the name of Peppy Dora in a rowdy music hall in Chicago and publicly embarrasses the theatre manager into paying her $300 so that she can take her family to England. Modelling her free-form style of dance and costume after Greek classicism, she rapidly acquires international acclaim. In Berlin, she meets her first love, Gordon Craig, a young stage designer who promises her that together they will create a new world of theatre. After bearing the already-married Craig a daughter, Isadora moves to Paris and meets Paris Singer, a millionaire who lavishes gifts upon her and later buys her an enormous estate for her to open a School for Life, where only beauty and simplicity are taught. Following the birth of a son, Isadora returns to England with Singer but becomes bored with her quiet life and enters into an affair with her pianist, Armand. A short time later, both of her children are drowned when their chauffeur-driven car plunges off a bridge into the Seine. Broken by the tragedy, Isadora leaves Singer and wanders about Europe until in 1921 she receives an offer to open a dancing school in the Soviet Union. Unaffected by the country's poverty, she develops a strong rapport with the peasantry and has a passionate affair with Sergei Essenin, a volatile poet whom she marries so that he can obtain a visa to accompany her to the United States. Essenin's outrageous behaviour turns a press conference into a shambles, however, and U.S. anti-Bolshevist sentiment turns to open hostility when Isadora bares her breasts during a dance recital in Boston. Following the disintegration of her marriage, she returns to Nice to write her memoirs. Impulsively selling her possessions to open a new school in Paris, Isadora goes to a local café to celebrate and spots Bugatti, a handsome Italian whom she has been admiring for several days. She goes for a drive with him in his sports car, and as they roar along a road by the sea, Isadora's long chiffon scarf catches in the spokes of a wheel and strangles her.",

    "Synopsis": "Charlie Adamo, the Mafia's recently promoted operations chief on the West Coast of the United States, attempts to muscle in on the newly constructed Royal Casino-Hotel in Las Vegas, demanding its manager Abe Stilberman sell him a 20% stake in the enterprise. When Stilberman refuses, Adamo arranges for convicted bank robber Hank McCain to be released from prison by his son Jack, who poses a plan to rob the casino without telling him of Adamo's involvement. McCain is interested, but he is wary of his son's obvious naivete and suspects more is happening than he's being told. Nonetheless, McCain begins casing the Royal, picking up and marrying an eager young woman named Irene along the way. Unbeknownst to Adamo, the Royal is owned by the Mafia. His superior, Don Francesco, demands he cease any attempt to buy a stake, and Adamo orders the heist called off immediately. However, McCain is determined to see it through and ignores his son's calls. Eventually, he agrees to meet him in a remote warehouse, where he points out that Jack's two cohorts (working for Adamo) plan to kill them both. McCain manages to kill them instead, but not before his son dies in the crossfire. McCain carries out his plan, setting off time bombs throughout the casino, detonating a second explosion outside town to distract authorities, and disguising himself as a firefighter to rob the safe while the building is evacuated. The plan goes off without a hitch, but Don Francesco learns of Adamo's involvement through the machinations of his wife. He tortures McCain and Irene's identities out of Adamo before having him killed. McCain and Irene are now on the run, with the Mafia distributing photographs of the two among their network of informants. With nowhere left to turn, McCain goes to his old lover and partner-in-crime Rosemary Scott. She arranges their safe passage out of the country, but she is found out and captured by Francesco's men. She kills herself before she can be tortured for information. Irene is spotted by an informant and captured. Francesco's men take her to McCain's awaiting boat, where they kill her. Enraged, McCain blindly fires at his assailants, but he is unceremoniously shot and killed. His and Irene's bodies are quietly disposed.",

    "film_title": "My Night at Maud's",
    "Synopsis": "Jean-Louis, a solitary, serious Catholic engineer recently relocated by Michelin to Clermont-Ferrand, is certain he will marry a young blonde woman named Françoise who he has seen at church. At a bar, he runs into his old school-friend Vidal, an atheist Marxist who is now a philosophy professor. They discuss Pascal, and Vidal invites Jean-Louis to a performance by violinist Leonid Kogan that evening. Afterward, Vidal asks if they can get together the next day, which is Christmas Eve, but Jean-Louis is going to Midnight Mass. Vidal accepts an invitation to come along, and arranges for them to visit his friend Maud afterward, though the visit gets delayed a day, as she has to see her ex-husband, with whom she has a daughter. When Vidal mentions he and Maud were lovers, Jean-Louis offers to let Vidal go alone, but Vidal says they are incompatible as a couple, and he wants Jean-Louis to help make sure the visit remains platonic. At Maud's apartment, Jean-Louis, Vidal, and the brunette, atheist pediatrician have a discussion about religion, Pascal, and Jean-Louis' relationship history. When it starts to snow, Maud, worried the drive to Jean-Louis' mountain village will be unsafe, offers her guest room. Vidal encourages Jean-Louis to stay and leaves. Maud makes herself comfortable on her living-room bed. She mentions she and her husband both had affairs: he with a Catholic woman whom she despised, and she with a man who died in a car crash on icy roads. When Maud reveals there is no guest room and invites Jean-Louis to join her in bed, a shocked Jean-Louis fails to get comfortable in a chair before deciding to sleep under a blanket on top of Maude's bedspread. Early in the morning, they kiss, but Jean-Louis pulls away. Maud recovers quickly and, as he prepares to go, reminds him of a day trip to the mountains with Vidal and some others that afternoon. On his way to meet up with Maud and her friends, Jean-Louis sees Françoise. He chases her down, and they arrange to have lunch after Mass the following day. In the mountains, Jean-Louis and Maud kiss, and she teases that she is not right for him, as she is neither Catholic, nor blonde. Back in town, they go shopping and make dinner together, and, before leaving, Jean-Louis says he thinks he has so quickly come to feel so happy around Maud because, as she is moving to Toulouse soon, \"The thought of the future needn't depress us, since we have none.\" They part, smiling. Jean-Louis sees Françoise and offers to drive her home. She is a biology postgraduate who also works at a lab, and, on the turnoff to her house, Jean-Louis gets stuck in the snow. Françoise offers to let him stay overnight in the room of one of her housemates, who all went home for the holiday, and they talk about relationships and choices over tea before retiring. Before leaving for church in the morning, Françoise gently rejects Jean-Louis' attempt to kiss her. He says he loves her, but she says he does not know her, and might disappoint him. They begin to date, and Françoise admits that, until recently, she was having an affair with a married man whom, although she loves Jean-Louis, she has not forgotten. He says they can move slowly, and that he still loves her, and is even glad, as he felt guilty for having past affairs, but now they are even. Françoise asks that they never again discuss this subject. On holiday five years later, Jean-Louis, now married to Françoise and with a son, sees Maud at the beach. Françoise and Maud, who know each other, exchange greetings as Françoise passes. Maud and Jean-Louis briefly reminisce, and she mentions she is in another unhappy marriage. Afterwards, Jean-Louis tells Françoise that Maud is the woman with whom he mentioned having spent the night just before they met, and is about to clarify that they did not have sex, when suddenly he realizes Françoise was the mistress of Maud's husband, and she is nervous Maud may have mentioned this. He does not broach the topic, she smiles, and they take their boy for a swim.",

    "film_title": "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (film)",
    "Synopsis": "Jean Brodie is a teacher at an all-girls school called Marcia Blaine in Edinburgh, in the 1930s. Brodie is known for her tendency to stray from the school's curriculum, to romanticise fascist leaders such as Benito Mussolini and Francisco Franco, and to believe herself to be in the prime of life—in particular, her sexual prime. Brodie devotes her energy and attention to girls she sees as special or mouldable, who are referred to as the \"Brodie Set\". At the film's outset, the Brodie Set is composed of four 12-year-old junior school girls: Sandy, Monica, Jenny, and Mary. The Brodie Set often go to art museums and theatre and have picnics on the school lawn, to the chagrin of the school's austere headmistress Emmaline Mackay. Miss Mackay dislikes that the girls are cultured to the exclusion of hard knowledge and seem precocious for their age. She has a grudge against Brodie, who has tenure and was hired six years before Mackay became headmistress. Brodie boasts to her girls that the only way she will stop teaching at Marcia Blaine is if she is assassinated. Brodie catches the eye of Gordon Lowther, the school's music teacher and choirmaster, with whom she and the girls spend weekends at his luxurious estate in Cramond. Brodie sometimes spends the night with Lowther, though she tries to conceal this from the girls. Lowther wishes to marry Brodie, but she still has feelings for the school's art teacher Teddy Lloyd, an ex-lover of Brodie's who steadily pursues her, although he is a married man with children. As the Brodie Set grow older and progress closer to the senior school, they frequent Teddy Lloyd's studio, where he paints Jenny's portrait. Sandy initially rebuffs a lecherous advance from Lloyd. However, when Brodie tries to manoeuvre Jenny and Lloyd into an affair, and Sandy into spying on them, it is Sandy, resentful of Brodie's constant praise of Jenny's beauty, who becomes Lloyd's lover and muse. Sandy ends the affair because of Lloyd's continuing obsession with Brodie. Mary, influenced by Brodie, leaves the school to join her brother, whom she believes to be fighting for Franco in the Spanish Civil War. She is killed shortly after crossing the frontier when the train she is on is attacked. This incites Sandy to tell the headmistress of Brodie's efforts to impose her politics on her students. The disclosure finally leads to Brodie's termination, her humiliation compounded by Lowther's engagement to another teacher. Before Brodie's departure, Sandy confronts her about her manipulation of Mary, Mary's senseless death, and the harmful influence she exerted on other girls, adding that Mary's brother is actually fighting for the Spanish Republicans. Brodie responds with a series of harsh but astute comments about Sandy's character, particularly her ability to coldly judge and destroy others. Sandy retorts that Brodie professed to be an admirer of conquerors and walks out of the classroom. Brodie runs after her and screams down the hallway, \"Assassin!\" Sandy, Monica, and Jenny graduate and leave the school. As Sandy departs, her face streaked with tears, Brodie's voice is heard proclaiming her oft-repeated motto: \"Little girls, I am in the business of putting old heads on young shoulders, and all my pupils are the crème de la crème. Give me a girl at an impressionable age, and she is mine for life.\"",

    "Unnamed: 0": 646,
    "year": 1969,
    "film_title": "Z (1969 film)",
    "Synopsis": "The left-wing opposition in an unnamed Mediterranean country (based on Greece under the junta) plan to have a famous government deputy (based on Grigoris Lambrakis) give a speech advocating for nuclear disarmament, but the government interferes by pressuring venues to deny them space and setting thugs on them to tear down posters and harass attendees. The opposition receive an anonymous tip about a threat to the deputy's life and report it to government officials, but they dismiss the claims. During the speech, Pirou, another deputy, goes to find their promised protection, but is mistaken for the real target and savagely beaten before his assailants realize they have the wrong man. As the intended target crosses the street from the hall after giving his speech, a delivery truck speeds past him, and a man on the open truck bed strikes him down with a club. The Chief Prosecutor is informed of the incident and the General (head of the state police and a fierce anticommunist) lies that the deputy has been injured by a drunk driver, Yago, who they have in custody. The phone then rings, revealing the deputy has died. At the hospital, the magistrate assigned to the investigation learns that the autopsy indicates the deputy died from blows to the head, not a car crash. He is informed of a witness, but before he can testify, the man is hit by a club from a passing car. The General and the man's family, who are sympathetic to the government, visit the man in the hospital and pressure him not to testify, but he does anyway, saying that Yago (his delivery driver) talked openly about the plan to murder the Deputy. The journalist visits the man and unwittingly spoils an assassination attempt by the Deputy's assailant Vago, who has been placed in the hospital by the government and is arrested. During the interrogation, the magistrate baits Vago into revealing that he is part of a clandestine anti-communist group, the Christian Royalist Organization against Communism (CROC), with ties to the state police. With the help of a CROC informer, the journalist learns more about the organization and photographs members that the informer points out. He then takes the photos to Pirou, who identifies his assailant. It is later revealed that the Colonel bribed Pirou's assailant with a lifetime peddling license and new house to assist in their plan against the deputy. As the magistrate continues to investigate CROC, he demands that the opposition counselor produce the witness who originally told them of the plot against the deputy, revealed to be a fellow deliveryman with ties to the former Greek communist resistance movement. He describes Yago threatening him into silence, and that he saw Yago with the Colonel and the head of CROC. As one of the other opposition lawyers heads to the office to testify, a car attempts to run him down in front of a crowd of witnesses. With a large amount of corroborating evidence, the magistrate plans to charge high-ranking military officers and, upon learning of this plan, the country's attorney general arrives and criticizes his plans, arguing that they will harm the nation. He suggests that the magistrate try Yago and Vago apart, leave the issue of the police to be solved internally, and indict the opposition for inflammatory speech, but he follows through with his plans. The General denies any affiliation with CROC, but the magistrate presents a photo of a banquet he hosted in their honor. The action of the film concludes with one of the deputy's associates rushing to see his widow to give her the surprising news of the officers' indictments, to which she looks distressed. An epilogue provides a synopsis of the subsequent turns of events. Instead of justice being served, the prosecutor is mysteriously removed from the case, several key witnesses die under suspicious circumstances, the assassins receive relatively short sentences, the officers receive only administrative reprimands, the deputy's close associates die or are deported and the photojournalist is sent to prison for disclosing official documents. The heads of the government resign after public disapproval, but before elections are carried out, a coup d'état occurs, and the military seize power. They ban modern art, popular music, avant-garde novelists, modern mathematics, classic and modern philosophers and the use of the letter \"Ζ\" ( , or , which is used by protesters against the former government), which refers to the deputy and means \"He lives.\"",

Harald, the father of the family, catches fish and manages to support his family while maintaining a good mood. Kjell, the oldest son, works at the office of the local sawmill manager, and is taught about classical music, impressionism and French pronunciation by the manager's wife. He plays in a jazz band with his friend Nisse with whom he also discusses things like girls, erogenous zones and hypnosis. As spring commences, the manager's daughter Anna comes home for school holiday. She and Kjell fall in love, and she becomes pregnant with his child. When the sawmill is to deliver a big order to America, strikebreakers are called in from other towns. The local strikers become furious and police has to be called in to protect the strikebreakers. Still they are attacked by an angry crowd while working at the Sandviken wharf outside Kramfors. Some are thrown into the water, while others are beaten bloody. Harald takes care of an injured strikebreaker, but is confronted by a group of angry workers. He tries to argue for them to calm down and rely on discussion instead of violence, but they do not agree with his stance. Because of the turbulence, military troops arrive to ensure safety. It is also decided by the County Administrative Board that the strikebreakers should be prohibited from working, but this information doesn't reach the upset locals, who decide to march to the locality where the strikebreakers are staying to get rid of them. When the military troops fail in persuading the participants to stop, they open fire. Five people are killed and five more are injured. Among the dead are Harald Andersson, Nisse and a young girl who had only been a bystander. Around the same time, Anna returns from Stockholm where she has had an abortion arranged by her mother. When Kjell is told about the abortion by Anna's father, he interprets it as if he isn't accepted within the bourgeois idyll. A general strike is proclaimed. While Kjell is occupied as a strike guard, he meets the man who had previously argued with his father. The man claims that the father wasn't innocent, since he had helped to divide the workers. Not until now they were united. Kjell does not agree, instead claiming that education is the key to a better society. Slowly, the Andersson family recover from the loss, and eventually the factories open again.",

    "Synopsis": "A recently promoted police inspector, nicknamed \"Il Dottore\" (\"the Doctor\", an Italian honorific) kills his mistress, and then covers up his involvement in the crime. He insinuates himself into the investigation, planting clues to steer his subordinate officers toward a series of other suspects, including the woman's gay husband and a student leftist radical. He then exonerates the other suspects and leads the investigators toward himself to prove that he is \"above suspicion\" and can get away with anything, even while being investigated. His personal neurosis caused by his extreme position of power, and his firm beliefs in the role of authority, eventually drive him to try to accuse himself with every possible evidence. The only witness of his presence at the victim's apartment, the anarchist Antonio Pace, refuses to accuse him to be able to prove the inherent criminal nature of power (\"A criminal leading the repression, it is perfect!\"). The Doctor eventually desperately confesses to the crime in front of his superiors, in an effort to not subvert the essence of authority, but they all refuse to believe him, forcing him to recant his confession, with the approval of the police commissioner. The interrogation at his home is revealed to be a dream sequence, and when he wakes up the commissioner and other colleagues actually arrive at his place; however, the outcome of their confrontation is not revealed, and the film ends with a quote by Franz Kafka about the paradoxical nature of power.",

In the opening sequence, Vivaldi's “Autumn” can be heard while the prisoners are liberated. A young Polish poet, Tadeusz, is asked by a pretty Jewish girl, Nina, to go with her to the West. His camp experience, however, prevents him from realizing the depth of her love for him, and he is reluctant to commit. Nina is accidentally shot dead by an American soldier, causing Tadeusz to cry for the first time in years. The shock of her death brings back the world of feelings suppressed by his Nazi captors, and allows for his original creativity to reemerge. The credits appear to the sound of Vivaldi's “Winter”.",

    "Synopsis": "The ennui-afflicted heir to a deposed European throne returns to his father's house in West London to find that the neighbourhood has become a slum. An ornithologist ill at ease with others, he finds his spy-glass wandering from birds to observe his neighbours. Strictly an observer at first, he increasingly becomes agitated as their lives are blighted by violence, poverty, and injustice. In particular, he is moved by the plight of young Salambo Mardi and her family, beset by the rapist shopkeeper Kowalski and the pimp Jasper. Gradually he is stirred from his emotional detachment to try to assist her, a development that confuses, alarms, and angers his parasitic entourage: Margaret, his social climber fiancée; Max, the shady family lawyer (who for reasons never directly explained is desperate for Leo to marry Margaret); David, his quack doctor; and Laszlo, the household manager, and apparent leader of a secret society aiming to restore the dynasty. (Leo's sudden vitality also threatens Jasper the pimp who is, in fact, in league with Laszlo.) A pacifist and liberal idealist with no interest in reigning, Leo is relieved when Laszlo confesses that the society is a fraud, but furious when he discovers that he himself is the owner of the slum and his life of wealth and privilege has been paid for from its rents. Leo becomes the unlikeliest of revolutionaries, rallying the denizens of the slum with the aid of Salambo and her charismatic working-class hero boyfriend Roscoe. The intellectual and professional class (in the person of the socialite, the doctor, and the lawyer) is quickly overcome, but the capitalists and petite bourgeoisie (pimp, rent collector, shopkeeper, and real estate shareholders) prove tougher, fortifying themselves in Leo's mansion. In the final cataclysm, Leo leads the mob in burning his own mansion to the ground, its occupiers surrendering and fleeing at the last moment. In the last line of dialogue, Roscoe tells Leo: \"Well, you didn’t change the world, did you?” Leo replies: \"No, but we changed our street\". The victors laugh together and disperse. Leo wanders up to his old home and picks from the rubble one of his old spy-glasses. Smiling happily, he chucks it aside and skips merrily away.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1951, the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital in South Korea is assigned two new surgeons, \"Hawkeye\" Pierce and \"Duke\" Forrest, who arrive in a stolen Jeep. They are insubordinate, womanizing, mischievous rule-breakers, but they prove to be excellent combat surgeons. Other characters include the bungling commanding officer Henry Blake, his hyper-competent chief clerk Radar O'Reilly, dentist Walter \"Painless Pole\" Waldowski, the pompous and incompetent surgeon Frank Burns, and the contemplative Chaplain Father Mulcahy. Irritated by Frank's religious fervor, Hawkeye and Duke get Blake to move him to another tent so newly arrived chest surgeon Trapper John McIntyre can move in. The three draftee doctors (the \"Swampmen\", after the nickname for their tent) have little respect for military protocol, and pass time with pranks and heavy drinking. Frank, a straitlaced by-the-book military officer, bonds with Margaret Houlihan<!--do not change to O'Houlihan; see Talk Page and help reach a consensus-->, the 4077th's head nurse and develop a love affair. Radar and the Swampmen sneak a microphone into her tent and broadcast the pair's sexual encounter over the public address system, earning Houlihan the nickname \"Hot Lips\". The next morning, Hawkeye goads Frank into assaulting him, and Burns is removed for psychiatric evaluation. Later, when Houlihan is showering, the Swampmen pull the tent sides off and expose her, in order to settle a bet over whether she is a natural blonde. Houlihan confronts Blake for his weak leadership and threatens to resign her commission; Blake bluntly tells her she can do so. Painless, described as \"best-equipped dentist in the Army\" and \"the dental Don Juan of Detroit\", fears an incident of impotence has turned him homosexual and he announces his intent to commit suicide. The Swampmen agree to help, stage a feast to evoke Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper, arrange for Father Mulcahy to give absolution and communion, and provide him with a \"black capsule\" (actually a sleeping pill) to speed him on his way. Hawkeye persuades the gorgeous Lieutenant \"Dish\" Schneider&nbsp;– who has remained faithful to her husband and is being transferred back to the United States for discharge&nbsp;– to spend the night with Painless and allay his concern about his \"latent homosexuality\". The next morning, Painless is his usual cheerful self, and a smiling Dish departs for home in a helicopter. Hawkeye and Trapper fly to Japan to operate on a Congressman's son as a way of playing golf. When they also perform an unauthorized operation on a local infant, they face disciplinary action from the hospital commander for misusing Army resources. Trapper uses anesthetic gas to sedate the commander. Using staged photographs of him as he awakens in bed with a prostitute, they blackmail him into keeping his mouth shut. Blake and General Hammond organize a football game between the 4077th and the 325th Evac Hospital and heavily wager on the outcome. At Hawkeye's suggestion, Blake applies to have a specific neurosurgeon&nbsp;– Dr. Oliver Harmon \"Spearchucker\" Jones, a former professional football player for the San Francisco 49ers&nbsp;– transferred to the 4077th as a ringer. Hawkeye also suggests Blake bet half his money up front and keep Jones out of the first half of the game. The 325th scores repeatedly and easily, even after the 4077th drugs one of their star players to incapacitate him. Hammond confidently offers high odds, against which Blake bets the rest of his money. Jones enters the second half, which quickly devolves into a free-for-all, and the 4077th gets the 325th's second ringer thrown out of the game and wins with a final trick play. Not long after the football game, Hawkeye and Duke get their discharge orders and begin their journey home&nbsp;– taking the same stolen Jeep in which they arrived.",

He serves food to the elderly, feeds and bathes them, tends to the garden, and is responsible for the building’s maintenance under the watchful eye of the strict home manager, Stein (Shlomo Bar-Shavit). In his free time, he draws portraits of the elderly residents and tries to sell them at a nearby gallery, but there are no buyers for his sketches. He rarely speaks and appears eccentric. When he walks from the nursing home to his room in the city, children stare at him as if he is odd and mentally unstable. Of all the elderly residents, he is particularly drawn to Rachel (Berta Litvinov), an elderly woman from Kiev who speaks broken Hebrew. The other residents gossip in Yiddish about the relationship between Eli and Rachel. Rachel likes Eli and wants to help him. She dresses as a tourist, goes to the gallery, and buys Eli’s drawings.

    "Synopsis": "At Festa de l'Unità in Rome, a florist named Adelaide Ciafrocchi meets Oreste Nardi, a middle-aged communist bricklayer. She tells him that she once saw him passing her flower stand at the Campo Verano cemetery, and they fall in love, despite the fact that he is married to the much older Antonia. Upon discovering the affair, Antonia confronts Adelaide at her flower stand. When Adelaide vehemently refuses to leave Oreste and mistakes Antonia for his mother, Antonia physically attacks Adelaide, who ends up hospitalised. Visiting Adelaide at the hospital, Oreste excitedly tells her that they are free to be together now that he has left Antonia. While dining with Oreste at a pizzeria, Adelaide catches the attention of a young Tuscan pizza chef, Nello Serafini, who sends her a heart-shaped pizza. Oreste and Nello later bond after they both attend a PCI protest march. Oreste formally introduces Nello to Adelaide, and the three soon become inseparable friends. Adelaide begins an affair with Nello, but finds herself torn between the two men as she loves both. After seeing Adelaide and Nello in bed together, a vengeful Oreste takes her to the pizzeria where Nello works and publicly exposes their affair, causing a scene. Adelaide expresses no remorse, prompting Oreste to beat her, and she is hospitalised for the second time. Adelaide undergoes psychoanalysis to discuss her obsession with both Oreste and Nello. Overcome with guilt, she attempts suicide by inhaling gas and is rushed to the hospital for the third time. Still unable to choose between Oreste and Nello, Adelaide proposes a threesome, but the men end up fighting and she abandons both of them. On the advice of her older sister Silvana, a prostitute, Adelaide begins a relationship with a wealthy and crude butcher, Ambleto, for the purpose of marriage, but she eventually leaves him to reconcile with Nello, who has attempted suicide because of her. In a desperate attempt to win Adelaide back, Oreste, who is now unemployed, pleads with a Gypsy couple to cast a love spell, to no avail. Shortly after their wedding, Adelaide and Nello drive by Oreste as he sleeps in a street market. Nello stops to talk to Oreste, who becomes angry when he realises that Adelaide and Nello have married without telling him. The newlyweds attempt to drive off, but the car will not start. Oreste pulls Nello out of the car and beats him with a stick. To defend himself, Nello attacks Oreste with a pair of shears. In the ensuing chaos, Oreste grabs hold of the shears and inadvertently stabs Adelaide. As she dies, she declares that she loves Oreste more. Using the insanity defense, Oreste is sentenced to five years in prison and two years in an insane asylum. After serving his sentence, he wanders around the city and, now completely out of his mind, engages in imaginary conversations with his beloved Adelaide, convinced that he will always have her by his side.",

    "Synopsis": "The film follows the radicalization of Simon, a student at a fictional university in San Francisco. Initially indifferent to the student protests around him, Simon learns of plans to occupy a university building in opposition to the construction of an allegedly segregated gym against the wishes of the local minority community. His curiosity is piqued, and he makes his way to the protest. On the way, he spots a fellow student, Linda, and falls in love with her at first sight. He follows her into the protest, and they both join in. Later, when the strikers become hungry, they rob a local grocer together. As their relationship develops, Simon confesses to Linda his lack of commitment, explaining that he worked hard to gain college admission in the first place. Linda responds that she cannot date someone who is not equally devoted to the movement. As a result, they part ways—for now. Afterward, Simon is assaulted by a right-wing athlete, George, but uses his injuries to claim police brutality. Gaining attention among students, he is unexpectedly seduced by a young woman protester. Later, however, Linda returns, announcing her decision to stay with Simon. They spend an afternoon in the park, where they are accosted by a group of African Americans, one of whom destroys Simon's camera. Furious, Simon later expresses his disillusionment, telling protesters that those they seek to help seem no different from the violent cops. However, he reconsiders his stance after visiting George in the hospital. The same jock who had assaulted him now suffers from injuries inflicted by right-wingers as the police stood by and watched. Leaving the hospital, Simon visits the dean's office and warns an administrative assistant to halt construction of the gymnasium or risk violence. Eventually, city police and the National Guard, armed with bayoneted rifles, arrive and crush the university building takeover with tear gas. As the strikers choke, police and guardsmen drag the demonstrators from the building, beating them with batons. As Linda is carried away, kicking and screaming, Simon launches a solo attack on a group of officers. In the film's final moments, flashes of his happier college days appear before the viewers' eyes.",

    "Synopsis": "The structure of the film involves frequent jumps in time—between the time of, and after, the car crash, and before the crash. The opening sequence jumps between the period immediately after the crash, and the crash itself. In the French countryside on a summer morning, a lorry full of pigs stalls at a crossroads. An Alfa Romeo Giulietta Sprint swerves to avoid it and crashes into an orchard, hurling the driver, Pierre (Michel Piccoli), onto the grass. As he drifts in and out of consciousness, he revisits the essential things which make up his life. A Paris architect in his forties driving to a meeting at Rennes, Pierre had quarreled with his lover Hélène (Romy Schneider) the previous night. They were due to leave together for a job he was offered in Tunis but he hadn't signed the documents. But he had agreed to take his teenage son Bertrand, who lived with his estranged wife Catherine, for a holiday in the family's holiday home on the Île de Ré. Stopping at a café, he wrote to Hélène calling everything off, but did not post the letter. Driving past a wedding, he decides that the letter was quite wrong and he should marry Hélène. Rushed to hospital in Le Mans, he does not recover. As his widow, Catherine is given his effects, including the unsent letter to Hélène. Catherine is reading it by the window when she sees Hélène running to reach Pierre's bedside. She tears the letter to pieces, and Hélène is told by a nurse that she is too late.",

    "film_title": "Between Miracles",
    "Synopsis": "A qualified surgeon is urgently called by a party in a small and inadequate private hospital to operate a man in critical condition because of a suicide attempt. This is the protagonist of the film, Benedict Parisi, whose first name seems prophetic of his story. In the waiting room is the companion Joan Micheli, pregnant with him, which&mdash;Benedict being alone in the world&mdash;gives consent to the risky operation. Her mother, Immaculate, however, hovers in the wings like a vulture, hoping he will die, because she aspires to marry Giovanna off to a lawyer friend of the family, as a better social and economic proposition. The narrative is interwoven with flashbacks to the early life of Benedict. He is an orphan, a lively lad growing up in village in the Latin Valley, under the tutelage of a maiden aunt who is filled with religious scruples, though given to libertine assignations, with which she indoctrinates him. The child is sleepless at night, because of noises from his aunt's room, which is visited by local men: his aunt instead tells him that the noises are a matter of remorse for his bad habits, and he is overcome by guilty feelings resulting from his repressive environment. When the day of his first communion nears, for which he prepares with accentuated religious devotion, he, with the other communicants, is given an effigy of \"celestial friends,\" saints who are expected to assist them until they embrace Jesus. Benedict receives the effigy of Saint Eusebius. On that very night the boy is awoken by noises - one of the aunt's lovers, Giovanni, happens to be visiting. He runs to his aunt's room, and she hides the man in her closet. But the intruder's presence is soon revealed, and the aunt papers over his presence in her room by claiming that in fact Giovanni is St Eusebius. Benedict is told not to inform the priest of what happened, -to do so would only offend the \"celestial friends\" by what would be a sin of pride. The next morning, while he is affixing a picture of St Eusebius in her wardrobe to commemorate the occasion, he has a glimpse of his aunt, who returns from the bath, in a state of nakedness. She discovers him, and warns him not to say anything to the priest, even in the confession which will be the prelude to his first communion. This prohibition leads to him refraining from telling all of his 'sins' in confession to Father Quirino, and, ashamed by a sense that he has committed a sacrilege, during the first communion he feels that the host has stuck in his throat, and in a panic at incipient suffocation, runs away, only to slip from a wall and fall into a ravine Despite local fears that he has come to a sorry end, he emerges unharmed, and the people proclaim that he has been the beneficiary of a miracle. The boy is dressed up like the saint, and carried in procession, as though he were a veritable icon. The aunt exploits the opportunity this concatenation of coincidences affords her, by ridding herself of this troublesome burden, by sending him to the Franciscan monastery, where he then grows up to maturity. Among the friars, who take to admiring him for his simplicity and naivety, he works as a labourer. The brotherhood await for some 'sign' that will indicate his vocation in life. During a visit by a travelling salesman, Uncle Checco, h catches a glimpse in the car, of a photo of a nude woman, and the vision, together with his fantasies of being at the wheel of a vehicle that travels daily throughout the wider world of the countryside below, disturbs him. It provokes his desire, and also his fears of leaving the security of the monastery. While working in the fields one day, a schoolteacher is bitten by a snake, and pleads with him to save her. He kills the snake (symbol of the primal temptation) and, when he explains to her that the venom must be sucked out through an incision, proceeds to suck her upper calf, spitting the poison out, yet massaging her legs in a frenzy of barely disguised ardour. He has, he tells the friar in a drunken moment, found the sign they were all waiting for. He joins Uncle Checco and travels about seeling cloth and undergarments. It then becomes vendor of clothing, especially undergarments. The activity \"little debonair\" does it again collide with the ministers of God, in the same bed in which those women, attracted by new fashions, visit his truck. But Benedict, blocked by his scruples, unable to take advantage of easy opportunities that come his way as well as meeting and chatting with a beautiful village girl who had come to him at night to buy panties French and willing to pay in kind . Until, during a sleepless night, he met a pharmacist atheist, Oreste Micheli, who sympathizes with him and tries to pull him away from religious scruples and the faith itself. It also leads to a prostitute but Benedict does not consume the relationship because the woman is married. In love, loved by the beautiful daughter of the pharmacist Joan Benedict believes he has given peace to his existence. Orestes has never married the mother of Joan, Immaculate, a woman on the contrary very observant if not bigoted, that continues to threaten want to report the alleged sexual abuse that gave rise to daughter. Giovanna, as Benedict is a virgin, is rather close to the ideas of his father, and leads the young man to overcome his resistance and finally get rid of her sexual inhibitions. But he is torn between the desire to marry, a decision welcomed by the mother, and the sympathy for the ideas of Orestes. When you finally decide to get married at the crucial moment Benedict hesitate to assent to the formula Giovanna bed and is in its place no answers. The two young men, by mutual agreement, give birth to live together as husband and wife for six years. Shortly after the discovery of the pregnancy of Joan, Orestes has a heart attack. In the absence of Benedict, Immaculate Conception, the mother of Joan, torpor of takes advantage of the imminent death of Orestes to give him the last rites. The pharmacist atheist, dying, without gloss, kiss the crucifix which the priest approaches the lips. Benedict arrives in time to witness the scene and shocked by the alleged conversion of his beloved \"father\" runs away and tries to commit suicide by jumping off a cliff over the sea. Conducted in the hospital, will be saved, then abruptly ridestandosi the words of the professor-surgeon who says the evidence of success of the operation: \"It was a miracle!\"",

    "film_title": "Death in Venice (film)",
    "Synopsis": "Composer Gustav von Aschenbach travels to Venice for rest, due to serious health concerns. During his ship's arrival, an importunate and conspicuously made-up older man approaches Aschenbach with suggestive gestures and phrases, whereupon Aschenbach turns away indignantly. Aschenbach takes quarters in the beachside Grand Hotel des Bains on the Venice Lido. While awaiting dinner in the hotel's lobby, he notices a group of young Poles with their governess and mother, and becomes spellbound by the handsome boy Tadzio, whose casual dress and demeanor distinguishes him from his modest sisters. Tadzio's image causes Aschenbach to recall an increasingly emotional and heated conversation with his friend and student Alfred, in which they question whether beauty is created artistically or naturally, and if beauty, as a natural phenomenon, is superior to art. In the following days, Aschenbach observes Tadzio playing and swimming. When he manages to get close to the boy in the hotel's elevator, Tadzio seems to throw a seductive look at Aschenbach while exiting the lift. Returning to his room in an agitated state, Aschenbach remembers a particularly personal argument with Alfred, and he hesitantly decides to leave Venice. However, when his luggage is misplaced at the train station, he is secretly relieved and delighted at the prospect of returning to the hotel in order to be near Tadzio again. Before his return, he sees an emaciated man collapse in the station concourse, and, when he attempts to investigate this, the flattering hotel manager speaks in a dismissive matter of exaggerated scandals in the foreign press. Aschenbach adopts Tadzio as an artistic muse, but fails to master his passion for him and frequently loses himself in daydreams of the unattainable boy. When a travel agent on Saint Mark's Square hesitantly reports to Aschenbach that a cholera epidemic is sweeping through Venice, Aschenbach's attention falters and he fantasizes about warning Tadzio's mother of the danger while stroking her son's head. Though Aschenbach and Tadzio never converse, Tadzio notices he is being watched and responds with an occasional returned glance. Aschenbach follows Tadzio and his family to St Mark's Basilica, where he observes him praying. He gets a makeover from a chatty hairdresser, giving him a resemblance to the old man who had pestered him upon his arrival. He pursues Tadzio's family again, until he collapses near a well and bursts into a pained laughter. Back in his hotel room, Aschenbach dreams of a disastrous performance in Munich and Alfred's accusations afterward. When Aschenbach learns that Tadzio's family will be leaving the hotel, he weakly makes his way to the nearly-deserted beach, where he watches with concern as Tadzio's game with an older boy degenerates into a wrestling match. Upon recovering, Tadzio strolls away and wades into the sea to the enraptured tones of Mahler's Adagietto. He slowly turns and looks toward the dying Aschenbach, then raises his arm and points off into the distance. Aschenbach tries to rise, but collapses in his deck chair, dead.",

    "Synopsis": "Hector Bloom is a laconic, libidinous college basketball star distracted by obligations and current events: the misadventures of his volatile roommate Gabriel, a potential pro career, the draft, campus unrest, and a turbulent affair with Olive, the wife of Richard, a professor and friend. His coach pays special attention to him, given Hector's abilities, but is unsure how to get him to focus and fulfill his potential. Hector's attitude, and his coach's frustration, is exemplified by a meeting before an important late-season game where the coach instructs him to \"play it straight out there tonight, I don't want any fooling around at all\"; to his coach's exasperation, Hector replies \"Why not?\" Gabriel, a vulgar borderline psychotic, is far more troubled and committed to rebellion than Hector. He abuses drugs, disrupts a basketball game with a guerrilla theatre stunt, goes crazy during an induction physical, ransacks his apartment, espouses anti-establishment views about everything, and drifts aimlessly. During a confrontation in a grocery store, Olive informs Hector that she is pregnant, implies he is not the father, and tells him their affair is over. Hector replies that he has \"the clap\", which infuriates Olive; she warns him that if he follows her, she will call the police. That night, Hector leads his team to a huge victory; the fans storm the court, and triumphantly carry Hector off. At the same time, Gabriel breaks into Olive's house while she is bathing and physically assaults her. She fends off his attack, eventually running outdoors with Gabriel in pursuit just as Hector drives up. Gabriel, aware of Hector's trysts with Olive, screams at Hector that Olive prefers him over Richard, then runs off when Richard arrives home. Hector confronts Richard, telling him Olive should be with him; a shaken Olive asserts her independence, saying \"I'm not going with anybody, anywhere\". Richard warns Hector \"I'll kill you\", then escorts Olive back into their house. The next morning Gabriel, completely naked, runs into a biology lab and frees snakes, an iguana, mice and other vermin. Eventually campus police and white-coated attendants arrive with a straitjacket; Gabriel rebuffs them, insisting he is both \"right and sane\". They cloak him in a blanket and lead him into a padded van. Hector, seeing this, jumps onto the back of the van, demanding they open it. As the van pulls away, he jumps off, yelling to Gabriel that his mother called.",

He has lost his eyes, ears, mouth, nose, and limbs, but remains conscious and able to reason, rendering him a prisoner in his own body. As he drifts between reality and fantasy, he remembers his old life with his Christian Science family and his girlfriend Kareen. He also forms a bond of sorts with a young nurse who senses his plight, although the doctors think he is in a vegetative state. Eventually, Joe communicates with his doctors by banging his head against his pillow in Morse code, spelling out \"help\" to show he is conscious. He is asked what he wants, and requests for the United States Army to put him in a glass coffin in a freak show as a demonstration of the horrors of war. When told that this is against regulations, he responds by repeatedly begging to be euthanized. Joe ultimately realizes that the U.S. Army will not grant either wish, and will likely leave him in a state of living death. His sympathetic nurse attempts to euthanize him by clamping his breathing tube, but her supervisor stops her before Joe can succumb. In the end, Joe is left alone in his bed in a utility room at the hospital, weakly repeating to himself, \"S.O.S. Help me.\"",

In dealing with the situation, he starts negotiations. An employee, the beautiful and fiery Irene, nicknamed Califfa, whose worker-husband was killed during a demonstration, meets with Doberdò. He wants to induce the strikers back to work and they show uncertainty between the directives of their union and the incitements to violence by extremists.

    "Synopsis": "The film is set in Hungary during the Stalinist era in the early 1950s. During an operation against dissidents, János, a film director, was arrested and sentenced to ten years in prison. His wife, Luca, has not seen her husband since and is kept in the dark about his condition. She is dismissed from her teaching position as politically unreliable. She ekes out a living as a newspaper cashier, under constant surveillance and harassment. Her friends are also paralyzed with fear. The state moves subtenants into her large city apartment. In order to survive, she must gradually sell off her valuable furniture and clothes. Her ninety-year-old mother-in-law, frail and bedridden, lives in a small suburban house in a room with her books and a hodgepodge of dishes, blankets, and pictures from bygone eras, being looked after by a housekeeper. Luca visits her daily and regularly brings fresh flowers and small surprises; they play a game of supposedly not wanting to receive gifts. Her mother-in-law is attached to János, her youngest son; she expects great things from him. As a child, he was stubborn and mischievous, just like herself. She is very pleased with her daughter-in-law and her beauty, and the two are on good terms. However, Luca has not told her about her son's arrest and conviction a year ago, instead leading her to believe that he has traveled to the USA to make a film. She ensures that her mother-in-law receives forged letters from her son in America, in which he writes about his successes, intentionally outlandish and fanciful to appeal to her vanity, but also that production difficulties prevent him from returning immediately. These supposed successes evoke memories from the mother's own upper-class past. Luca, on the other hand, is teetering on the brink of a nervous breakdown under the weight of worrying about János and the act she has to continue to perform. Her mother-in-law waits for János's return, but visibly deteriorates, having to be cared for day and night by the housekeeper and Luca. In her pride, she rejects a stranger's caregiver. She deteriorates and dies, not dying in her son's arms as she had expected. A few months after her death, János is abruptly released from prison as a result of the Khruschev thaw. When Luca returns home that evening, János is waiting for her in her room. They reassure each other of their continued love.",

    "Synopsis": "Laurent Chevalier is a 14-year-old boy living in Dijon in 1954 who loves jazz, always receives the highest grades in his class, and opposes the First Indochina War. He has an unloving father, Charles, a gynecologist; an affectionate Italian-born mother, Clara; and two older brothers, Thomas and Marc. Thomas and Marc are inveterate pranksters, while Laurent engages in taboos such as shoplifting and masturbation. Laurent also discovers that Clara has a lover, and upset by the adultery, runs to tell Charles, who, busy with his practice, angrily turns him away. One night, Thomas and Marc take Laurent to a brothel, where Laurent loses his virginity to a prostitute, Freda, before they are disrupted by his drunken brothers. Upset, Laurent leaves for scouting camp, where he catches scarlet fever and is left with a heart murmur. Bedridden for a month, he is cared for and entertained by Clara and their maid, Augusta. Laurent's teacher at his Catholic school suggests that Laurent's illness has matured him, so that he has made progress in his studies, and urges Clara to treat him more like an adult. As Laurent requires treatment at a sanatorium, he and Clara check into a hotel. Due to an error by Charles's secretary Solange, the hotel books both Clara and Laurent into a single room, and given that the hotel is completely full, no additional room is available. Laurent takes interest in two young girls at the hotel, Hélène and Daphne, and also spies on his mother in the bathtub. Though Laurent pursues Hélène, Hélène says she is not ready for sex; Laurent accuses her of being a lesbian. Clara temporarily leaves with her lover, but comes back distraught after their breakup; Laurent comforts her. After a night of heavy drinking on Bastille Day, Laurent and his mother have sex. Clara tells her son afterward that this incest will not be repeated, but that they should not regret it. Laurent leaves their room, and after unsuccessfully trying to seduce Hélène, spends the night with Daphne. When he returns to his family late in the morning, they immediately deduce what has happened, and all of them, including Laurent, share a hearty laugh.",

Their anarchist political beliefs are used as evidence against them, but defense attorney Fred Moore is convinced of their innocence. As anti-immigrant and anti-leftist sentiments run high, the two are repeatedly railroaded by the political and judicial establishment, who intend to make an example of the two. The two are found guilty and sentenced to death. Vanzetti attempts to get clemency by pleading guilty, but later retracts, praising the courage of Sacco, who, by not bending to the request for clemency, will have given full testimony of his own innocence. The two are executed by electric chair in 1927, maintaining their innocence to their deaths.",

    "Synopsis": "Larry and Lynn Tyne return home to find their daughter Jeannie absent. (Viewers know she is attending an audition, clips from which, with future star performers like Carly Simon and Kathy Bates, recur throughout the film.) The Tynes ring the Divitos, with whose daughter Jeannie was supposed to be, but she says she doesn't know anything. They enlist their friends Tony and Margot for support; the men are unwillingly pushed out to search the neighborhood bars while the women stay by the phone and gossip about Margot's sex life. When the men return drunk, Jeannie reappears. Next day, she has vanished again and Larry searches the city. He happens to run across another missing girl. Before she takes off with her hippie friends in a multiple chase scene, he manages to phone and bring her mother Ann. She tells Larry about the Society for the Parents of Fugitive Children. The police call that Jeannie was arrested for stealing 300 miles upstate. The Tynes drive to claim her but find the Divitos' girl in custody, having given a false name to avoid her own parents. They decide to stay the night at a hotel, where Ike & Tina Turner are performing. A drunk Lynn is followed to their room by an amorous stranger, unaware that Larry is waiting in the bed. After the stranger runs away, Lynn emerges from the bathroom and tries out some of the tips Margot had confided to her to Larry's further confusion. Back in NYC, the Tynes attend the SPFC's formal dinner. Afterwards, marijuana joints are handed round, and a young man named Schiavelli instructs the parents on how to smoke them. Happily high, Larry and Lynn take Ann and her husband Ben back to their home for more drinks; Ben initiates a game of \"Texas one-card show-off\" where the loser has to take off a piece of clothing. In the end a naked Larry sings \"Libiamo ne' lieti calici\" on top of the table just as Jeannie reappears, and the guests hastily leave. When Jeannie mutely admits to having been \"with a boy\", Larry asks her to invite him for dinner. He looks like a morose hippie, but proves to be an intelligent, soft-spoken musician whose protest songs unwittingly made him absurdly rich. Still, he declines to perform for the hosts. In the final scene, it is Lynn who plays the piano while Larry sings \"Stranger in Paradise\".",

    "Synopsis": "In this gentle, tragic drama, Olivier (John McEnery) is a wealthy young man. He spends his time building a boat on the lawn with his friend David (Jean-Pierre Cassel), a poor fisherman whom he grew up with. Though hardly idyllic, the relative calm provided by their friendship is disrupted by Eleonore (Claude Jade), a cute and determined young woman who sets her sights on David. She wants to wean David from his friendship with Olivier and plays on David's long-dormant jealousy of Olivier's wealth and easy life. Eleonore also plays the flipside of the jealousy issue, claiming that Olivier has made passes at her. Vincent Canby: \"Adorable acting, especially by Claude Jade, who brings the right mixture of conventionalism and self-interest into her role.\" The film was nominated for the Grand Prix and the Prix du Jury [http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm-45346/palmares/]",

    "Synopsis": "In November 1920, as the Russian Civil War draws to a close in the South, the Red Army presses into Crimea, causing widespread panic among those who had once thrived before the 1917 Revolution. This massive upheaval sweeps away members of the former elite, who now find themselves forced to leave their homeland in a desperate exodus to escape the advancing Red Army. In this chaotic landscape, the lives of disparate characters intertwine: Serafima Korzukhina, the wife of a former trade minister; General Charnota, a courageous White Army officer who has lost nearly everything except his pride; his partner, Lyuska; the thoughtful intellectual Golubkov; and the tortured White General Khludov, who struggles to hold on to his sanity, haunted by visions of the men he ordered executed. The group manages to escape to Constantinople, fleeing by train and ship. However, their new life in exile offers only poverty and hardship, a harsh fall from their former social standing. General Charnota, once a man of authority, now scrambles to survive in a foreign land, enduring the indignities of impoverished exile. Khludov becomes increasingly erratic, tormented by dreams of the atrocities he committed, the ghost of Krapilin haunting him wherever he goes. In Constantinople, Serafima faces an unbearable decision—resorting to prostitution for survival. To save her from this fate, Golubkov and Charnota embark on a desperate journey to Paris, hoping to find Serafima’s estranged husband, Korzukhin, who still holds the financial resources that could secure her future. However, when they finally locate Korzukhin, he coldly denies Serafima and refuses to provide any support. In a daring twist, Charnota challenges him to a card game, ultimately winning a significant sum. With Lyuska's help, as she is now involved with Korzukhin, Golubkov and Charnota successfully escape Paris with the money. Back in Constantinople, Golubkov and Serafima, now deeply connected by love and shared hardship, decide to return to Soviet Russia, despite the dangers and uncertainties that await them there. For them, the homeland they long for holds an idealized promise of belonging and redemption, no matter how distant it may be from the reality awaiting them. Meanwhile, the White generals, who cannot return due to the threat of execution, are resigned to their lives in exile. Charnota, embodying a mix of tragic defiance and dark humor, resumes his gambling and begins to call himself the \"Flying Dutchman\" or \"Ahasuerus,\" casting himself as a wanderer doomed to roam forever. Khludov, consumed by guilt and memories of the war, becomes increasingly lost in his visions. The film culminates with a dream-like scene where Golubkov and Serafima ride through a snowy Russian forest.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1900, twelve-year-old Leo Colston is invited to spend his summer holiday at Brandham Hall, the Norfolk country house of his wealthy school friend, Marcus Maudsley. Upon arriving at the house, the middle-class Leo finds himself out of place among the upper class; his hosts, particularly Marcus's older sister Marian, try to make him feel welcome. Leo soon develops a crush on the beautiful Marian, who dotes on the boy and buys him new clothes. Marcus becomes ill with the measles and has to stay quarantined in his bedroom, leaving Leo to entertain himself. While exploring the estate grounds, Leo wanders to a nearby farm and injures himself playing in one of the haystacks. Tenant farmer Ted Burgess tends to Leo's injury, asking the boy if he can bring a letter to Marian for him in return. Leo agrees and after he gives Marian the letter, she begs him to take another letter back to Ted. Leo becomes the regular messenger between Marian and Ted, who are engaged in a clandestine affair. Leo remains innocent about the proceedings and believes he is merely carrying secret messages between friends. Marian is not free to marry Ted; she is being courted by Hugh, Viscount Trimingham, the estate heir whom her parents want her to marry. One day, Leo sneaks a look at one of the letters Marian has entrusted him with. Leo is shocked and upset when he realizes it is a love note. Marian's engagement to Hugh is announced and Leo is relieved, thinking this means his messenger duties will no longer be needed. Marian and Ted continue their affair and proceed to rely on Leo as a go-between, much to the boy's worry and confusion. When Leo declines to carry a letter for Marian, she brutally scolds him, viciously reminding him of his inferior status. Leo writes to his mother asking if he can come home sooner than planned because he has overstayed his welcome; his mother responds that it would be rude to the Maudsleys if he left early. The day of Leo's thirteenth birthday party is marked by a record heatwave. Tensions between Marian and Leo have subsided, and she asks the youth to deliver another letter to Ted for her. Leo refuses and the two playfully chase each other outside. Madeleine, Marian's mother, sees them and inquires what the fuss is about. She spots the letter, but Marian lies and says she is sending Leo to deliver a letter to her former nanny, which Leo goes along with. Madeleine, suspecting Marian's affair, goes to speak alone with Leo. She prods the boy to show her the letter, but he claims he has lost it. During Leo's birthday dinner that evening, a thunderstorm breaks out. All of the Maudsley family members are at the dinner table to partake in the festivities, except for Marian. Though some family members insist on waiting for her, Madeleine loses her patience and goes to look for Marian herself, taking Leo along with her. She takes him to Ted's farm, where Marian and Ted are discovered having sex in the barn. The event has a long-lasting impact on Leo, as it is revealed that after he was caught with Marian, Ted shot and killed himself in his farmhouse kitchen. Fifty years later, Leo has returned to Brandham Hall a jaded, disillusioned man. In the years since, he has shut down his imaginative and emotional nature, making him unable to establish intimate relationships. He meets with the elderly Marian, now the Dowager Lady Trimingham, who is living in her former nanny's cottage. Leo learns that Marian went on to marry Hugh as planned but bore Ted's son. Hugh eventually acknowledged Ted's son as his own, before dying in 1910. Marian's son in turn died in the Second World War. Marian has become estranged from her grandson because of the scandal of his parentage, so she has once again sent for Leo as a go-between to help repair their relationship and inform her grandson that she did truly love Ted. Leo leaves to embark on his final errand for Marian.",

To do so, he will first have to return to France and get a divorce. On landing at Nantes in 1793, the Reign of Terror is raging and he is arrested by the authorities. Taken to a republican ceremony in the cathedral, he saves the life of a royalist girl, Pauline, and escapes with her to an isolated castle. There he finds Charlotte, claiming to be a widow, with Pauline's brother Henri. A prince arrives from London to organise resistance in the Vendée and is struck by Charlotte, who was told by a gypsy that she would become a princess. She admits that she is married to Nicolas, so the prince has him drugged and carried into the Hôtel de Ville in Nantes to get a divorce. Put back on his ship for America, Nicolas’ divorce certificate blows overboard. Diving into the Loire, he swims ashore to find Charlotte again, but she has left with the prince for neutral Germany. Pursuing her across France in the throes of the Austrian invasion, he catches her at the frontier. Fifteen years later, Nicolas is made a prince by Napoleon and the gypsy's prediction comes true.",

    "Synopsis": "In New York City, Helen returns to the apartment that she shares with her boyfriend Marco after an unhygienic and inept abortion. Helen becomes ill, and Bobby, an amiable small-time drug dealer to whom Marco owes money, shows gentleness and concern for her. When Marco leaves, Helen considers returning to her family, but instead moves in with Bobby. When she finds him taking drugs, he explains that he's \"only chipping.\" At Sherman Square and Verdi Square—nicknamed \"Needle Park\" because addicts trade and use drugs there—Bobby introduces Helen to acquaintances, including his brother Hank, who burgles for a living. Helen witnesses the intricate ritual of addicts shooting up heroin. Bobby and Helen are evicted and move into a sleazier building. After Bobby asks her to buy his heroin, Helen and the dealer Freddie are arrested by Detective Hotch. Hotch asks Helen, \"Bobby's got you scoring for him already, huh?\", implying that this is habitual for Bobby's girlfriends. He describes a \"panic\" in Needle Park, i.e., when the heroin supply is low and prices are high, addicts turn on each other, often turning in each other to the police, in return for favors. Hotch releases Helen, and she returns to Bobby, who begins to use drugs more heavily. Helen eventually begins to shoot up as well. Bobby realizes that Helen is using and proposes marriage. Hank asks what they will live on and offers work to Bobby as a burglar, to which Helen objects, insisting that she will get a job. However, she quits her waitressing after muddling some orders. Before Bobby is to assist Hank in a burglary, he overdoses. Hank is angry with Bobby but gives him another opportunity, during which Bobby is arrested. While he is in jail, Helen finds it harder to get drugs and ends up having sex with Hank. When Bobby is released, he viciously beats Helen. Bobby persuades Santo, a major dealer, to let him handle distribution in Needle Park, while Helen turns to prostitution for money. The addicts welcome Bobby as a reliable source. Helen's health deteriorates from drug use, her relationship with Bobby suffers, and Hotch monitors her. After Helen and one of her customers are detained, Hotch asks the arresting officer to free her, for he needs her. Helen's mother invites her to meet visiting family friends. Reluctantly, Helen agrees, dressing carefully to hide the track marks on her arms. Instead of attending, though, she picks up a customer, who Bobby chases away. Realizing that they have been through a lot, the couple takes the Staten Island Ferry to the \"country\" to buy a puppy. The two discuss the prospect of leaving Needle Park, to which Bobby replies that is \"where I live,\" indicating the binding ties he has to the locale and lifestyle of Needle Park. While on the boat back, they discuss moving away for a fresh start, but Bobby refuses and convinces Helen to shoot up in the men's room. When the puppy whines, Bobby puts it outside, but when Helen looks for it, she watches as it falls into the water. Helen visits Marco but soon returns to Bobby to steal his drugs. Needing to get high, Helen tells a doctor that she needs drugs for pain. Aware that she is addicted, the doctor provides samples and tells her never to return. Arrested for selling her excess pills to children, she is warned by Hotch about the dangers of the women's prison. Knowing that Bobby can lead them to Santo, he offers Helen a deal if she will help them to catch Bobby picking up a shipment. Over the next fortnight, Hotch approaches Helen several times, reminding her of her pending trial. Depressed, she increases her drug use but finally agrees. One night, Helen and Hotch watch Bobby, who has a large amount of heroin, apprehended. When he spots her, he yells. On his release, Helen waits for him at the gate. Although his impulse is to rebuff her, they walk away together.",

    "Synopsis": "John Grant is a young, middle-class schoolteacher who feels disgruntled because of the onerous terms of an employment bond that he signed with the government in return for receiving a tertiary education. The bond has forced him to accept a two-year post at a tiny school at Tiboonda, a remote township in the arid outback. It is the start of the Christmas holidays, and John plans on going to Sydney to see his girlfriend Robyn, but first he must travel by train to the nearby mining town of Bundanyabba – affectionately nicknamed \"The Yabba\" by the locals – in order to catch a Sydney-bound flight. Upon arriving at The Yabba, John goes to a pub. There he meets the local policeman, Jock Crawford, who befriends him after both drink repeated glasses of beer, first at the pub and then at an RSL club, where they witness an unnerving ANZAC memorial service. Crawford then introduces him to the illegal game of two-up, and to Clarence \"Doc\" Tydon, a vagrant, alcoholic medical practitioner who questions John's contemptuous view of The Yabba and its populace. Deciding to try his luck at two-up, John has a winning streak but becomes reckless: in a desperate bid to win enough money to pay off his bond, he loses all of his cash in two rounds. This results in John becoming stranded in The Yabba with no money, leaving him at the mercy of its searing heat and eccentric but sinister townsfolk. While drinking, John becomes friends with a resident named Tim Hynes and goes to Tim's house, where he meets his adult daughter, Janette, and his two friends, miners Dick and Joe. Tim, Dick and Joe engage in an all-day drinking session, where they are eventually joined by Doc. John converses with Janette, who quietly desires a life outside of waiting on her father and his friends. She aggressively tries to seduce John, who vomits partly in disgust and due to the beer he has ingested. After engaging in more debauched rituals with the Hynes and their guests, John finds refuge in Doc's isolated shack. After providing him with medicine to cure his hangover and feeding him on kangaroo meat, Doc expounds his worldview onto John, revealing that his alcoholism and self-sufficient attitude to life prevented him from practicing in Sydney. He also reveals that he and Janette have had a long-standing open relationship punctuated by unorthodox sexual encounters. John and Doc are joined by Dick and Joe in a drunken, barbaric kangaroo hunt that lasts into the night, which culminates in Joe engaging in fisticuffs with one such kangaroo and John clumsily stabbing another to death. The four then vandalize a bush pub, where Dick and Joe engage in a playful fight that turns brutal, interrupting Doc as he lectures an unconscious John about the violent nature of civilization despite its philosophical and materialistic trappings. At dawn, John returns to Doc's shack, where Doc initiates an apparent homosexual encounter between the two. Repulsed, John leaves that morning and returns to town, where his two suitcases, left behind at a hotel after he met Tim, are returned to him by Crawford. After discarding one suitcase – mostly containing textbooks, including one on Plato – he wanders through the desert towards Sydney, hitch-hiking with truck drivers where possible and procuring food using the rifle he was given during the hunt. He eventually arrives at a truck stop, where he persuades a driver he assumes is heading for Sydney to give him a lift. However, due to miscommunication, John returns to The Yabba instead. Enraged with Doc and his perversity, John rushes to his empty cabin, intent on shooting him upon his return. However, he becomes overwhelmed with loneliness and remorse, and turns his rifle on himself. Doc arrives to witness John shoot himself in the temple, the impact of which scars but fails to kill him. John recovers in the hospital and signs a statement from Crawford explaining that his suicide attempt was an accident. Several weeks later, Doc takes him to the railway station, where they quietly make peace with each other. No longer contemptuous of the outback's inhabitants and more assured of himself, John accepts the offer of a beer from other passengers on the train and returns to Tiboonda to begin the new school year.",

    "Synopsis": "A teenage girl and her younger brother live with their parents in a modest high rise apartment in Sydney. One day their father drives them into the Outback, still in their school uniforms, ostensibly for a picnic. As they prepare to eat, the father draws a gun and fires at the children. The boy believes it to be a game, but the daughter realises her father is attempting to murder them, and flees with her brother, seeking shelter behind rocks. She watches as her father sets their car on fire and shoots himself in the head. The girl conceals the suicide from her brother, retrieves some of the picnic food, and leads him away from the scene, attempting to walk home through the desert. By the middle of the next day, they are weak and the boy can barely walk. Discovering an oasis with a small water hole and a quandong tree, they spend the day playing, bathing, and resting. By the next morning, the water has dried up. They are then discovered by an Aboriginal boy. He does not speak English, much to the girl's frustration, but her brother mimes their need for water and the newcomer cheerfully shows them how to draw it from the drying bed of the oasis. The three travel together, with the Aboriginal boy sharing kangaroo meat he has caught from hunting. The boys learn to communicate to some extent using words from each other's languages and gestures; the girl makes no such attempts. While in the vicinity of a plantation, a white woman walks past the Aboriginal boy, who simply ignores her when she speaks to him. She appears to see the other children, but they do not see her, and they continue on their journey. The children also discover a weather balloon belonging to a nearby research team working in the desert. After drawing markings of a modern-style house, the Aboriginal boy eventually leads them to an abandoned farm, and takes the small boy to a nearby road. The Aboriginal boy hunts down a water buffalo and is wrestling it to the ground when two white hunters appear in a truck and nearly run him over. He watches in shock as they wantonly shoot several buffalo with a rifle. The boy then returns to the farm, but passes by without speaking. Later, the Aboriginal boy lies in a trance among a slew of buffalo bones, having painted himself in ceremonial markings. He returns to the farmhouse, catching the undressing girl by surprise, and initiates a courtship ritual, performing a dance in front of her. Although he dances outside all day and into the night until he becomes exhausted, she is frightened and hides from him, and tells her brother they will leave him the next day. In the morning, after they dress in their school uniforms, the brother takes her to the Aboriginal boy's body, hanging in a tree. Showing little emotion, the girl wipes ants from the dead boy's chest. Hiking up the road, the siblings find a nearly-deserted mining town where a surly employee directs them towards nearby accommodation. Years later, a man arrives home from work as the now adult girl prepares dinner. While he embraces her and relates office gossip, she either imagines or remembers a time in which she, her brother, and the Aboriginal boy are playing and swimming naked in a billabong in the Outback.",

    "Synopsis": "Present Day: Eleven-year-old Nessim accompanies his grandmother Rosa to visit the grave of her husband, who died forty years ago. Rosa promises to join him at the grave soon. Shortly after, she falls seriously ill. She believes that her grandson strongly resembles her late husband, after whom he was named. Year 1887: Rosa, aged only twenty, becomes a widow when her husband Rafael dies without leaving an heir. According to the law, Rafael's brother must marry her to continue the family name. However, Rafael's brother David is already married with four children. Rafael's younger brother Nessim, being only eleven, cannot marry her. Despite this, Nessim expresses his desire to marry Rosa, claiming his love for her. For this, he receives a slap from his mother. Rosa earns her living unusually for her time, working in the baths during the day and as a seamstress at night. Her friend Jamila tries to set her up with a tradesman named Eli, but Rosa refuses, knowing she is promised to Nessim by law as long as he is willing to marry her. One night, Nessim seeks refuge with her, despising his own mother. When Nessim's mother comes to take him home with great commotion the next day, the rabbi intervenes. Since Nessim wants to live with Rosa and she agrees to raise him, and David is relieved to have one less child in the house, Nessim is allowed to stay with Rosa. Rosa encourages him to study and rejects his declarations of love, reminding him that he is still a child. At the same time, she does not yield to Eli's advances but convinces him to take Nessim on as an apprentice at the age of thirteen. Nessim studies diligently, knowing that this is the only way he can earn money and eventually marry Rosa. However, his coming of age proves to be difficult over the months. He starts to rebel and come home late from playing. When Rosa reproaches him, he retorts that she is not his mother. Rosa pretends to throw him out of the house, and he collapses. Later, when he does household chores, he is mocked by the women of the street as a \"girl.\" At the same time, he is deeply horrified when a friend takes him to a brothel, where a woman offers herself to him. Shortly after, when Nessim receives his first job and gets paid, he becomes arrogant, throwing the money at Rosa, claiming to be an adult, and ordering her to bring him food. She responds coolly, stating that he has changed to the extent that she no longer wants him by her side. Nessim leaves her house bewildered. Five years later, Nessim is of legal age and has a girlfriend. A woman reads his future in a cup and explains that although he has a woman by his side, his heart belongs to another. Nessim returns to Rosa, pretending to visit her on behalf of a friend. However, she recognizes him and embraces him, having never forgotten him. The next morning, she explains to him that she still cannot marry him. He is the man prescribed to her by law. However, she wants to decide for herself. He reluctantly agrees to renounce his right to marry her. However, Rosa does not complete the formal ceremony of renunciation, \"Chalitza,\" in front of the rabbi; instead, she leaves the room prematurely. She withdraws, and Nessim collapses lovesick. Many months later, emaciated with pain, he seeks her out. Now she tells him about a young woman who became a widow. She recounts their story together, which ends with this woman asking him to be her husband. Both fall into each other's arms happily. In the present, Rosa senses her end approaching. One last time, she sits up in her bed and calls Nessim's name before she dies.",

    "Synopsis": "Wealthy children's author Cathryn receives several disturbing calls in her home in London one night; the female voice on the other end, sometimes cutting in on other phone conversations, suggests mockingly that her husband Hugh is having an affair. Hugh comes home, finding Cathryn in distress. Hugh attempts to comfort Cathryn, who witnesses a different man who is behaving as if he were her husband. She screams in horror and backs away, only to see her vision of the figure revert to Hugh. Hugh attributes Cathryn's outburst to stress and her pregnancy. He decides to take her on a vacation to an isolated cottage in the Irish countryside, where Cathryn can work on her book and take photographs for its illustrations. Upon her arrival, however, Cathryn hears voices saying her name and sees apparitions: While preparing lunch one day, she sees Hugh pass through the kitchen, then transform into her dead lover, Rene. Rene continues to appear to Cathryn around the house, and even speaks with her. Cathryn's paranoia and visions become increasingly pervasive, and are exacerbated when a neighbor and ex-lover, Marcel, brings his adolescent daughter, Susannah, to visit. Cathryn becomes unable to distinguish Hugh from Rene or Marcel, as the men shift before her eyes. One day, Rene taunts Cathryn, asking her to kill him if she wants rid of him, and hands her a shotgun. She shoots him through the abdomen; Susannah runs into the house and finds Cathryn standing in the den, having shot Hugh's camera to pieces. Cathryn claims that the gun accidentally fired when she was moving it. Seeking solace, Cathryn goes to a nearby waterfall, where she often sees her doppelgänger staring back at her. After one such occurrence, she returns to the house, where Hugh tells her that he has to leave for business. Cathryn drives him to the train station and returns to the house, where she finds Marcel waiting inside. He begins to undress to have sex with her, but she stabs him through the chest with a kitchen knife. The next morning, she encounters an elderly man walking his dog, and invites him to come inside for coffee, in spite of the fact that Marcel's corpse apparently lies in the living room (which suggests that she regards the \"murder\" as a hallucination); the old man declines the invitation. Later in the evening, Susannah stops by the house, and remarks that her father was not at home when she awoke that morning. Cathryn is alarmed by this, as it could mean that she really did kill Marcel. She is relieved to hear that Marcel did return drunk after midnight, and invites Susannah in for a cup of tea after reasoning that Marcel cannot be dead on her living room floor. Susannah asks Cathryn if she looked like her when she was young before saying, \"I'm going to be exactly like you.\" After having tea, Cathryn drives Susannah back home. Marcel comes out of the house and attempts to talk to Cathryn, but she drives away. While on a stretch of road through a desolate field, Cathryn witnesses her doppelgänger again, attempting to wave her down. At the house, she finds that both Rene and Marcel's corpses have reappeared in the living room. Cathryn leaves again, and encounters her doppelgänger at a bend in the road; this time she stops. The doppelgänger begs Cathryn to let her into the car, and the two begin to speak in unison. She then hits the doppelgänger with the car, knocking her off a cliff and into a waterfall below. Cathryn then drives back to her home in London. At her home, she goes to take a shower. While in the bathroom, the door opens, and the doppelgänger walks inside. Cathryn screams in terror, \"I killed you,\" to which the doppelgänger responds serenely, \"Not me.\" Hugh's corpse is then shown lying at the bottom of the falls (meaning that it was him who begged her to let him in the car and was killed when Cathryn, believing that he was her doppelgänger, ran him over the cliff).",

    "Synopsis": "Mexican War veteran Jeremiah Johnson takes up the life of a mountain man, supporting himself in the Rocky Mountains as a trapper. His first winter in mountain country is difficult, and he has a run-in with Paints-His-Shirt-Red, a chief of the Crow tribe. Johnson inadvertently disrupts the grizzly bear hunt of the elderly and eccentric Chris Lapp, nicknamed \"Bear Claw\", who mentors him on living in the high country. After a brush with Crows, including Lapp's acquaintance Paints-His-Shirt-Red, and learning the skills required to survive, Johnson sets off on his own. He comes across a cabin whose inhabitants were apparently attacked by Blackfoot warriors, leaving alive only a woman and her uncommunicative son. The woman, maddened by grief, forces Johnson to adopt her son. He and the boy, whom Johnson dubs \"Caleb\", come across Del Gue, a mountain man who has been robbed by the Blackfeet. Gue persuades Johnson to help recover his stolen goods, but Johnson counsels against violence when they find the Blackfoot camp. The men sneak into the camp at night to retrieve Gue's possessions, but Gue opens fire and the mountain men then kill the Blackfeet. Gue takes several Blackfoot horses and scalps. Johnson, disgusted with the needless killing, returns to Caleb. Soon afterward, they are surprised by Christianized Flatheads, who take them in as guests of honor. Johnson unknowingly places the chief in his debt by giving him the Blackfeet horses and scalps. According to Flathead custom, to maintain his honor the chief must either give his guest a greater gift or kill him. The chief gives his daughter Swan to be Johnson's bride. After the wedding, Gue goes off on his own, and Johnson, Caleb and Swan journey into the wilderness. Johnson finds a suitable location to build a cabin. They settle into this new home and slowly become a family. This life is interrupted by the arrival of a U.S. Army cavalry rescue party tasked with saving a stranded wagon train of settlers. Although Johnson is reluctant, he is pressed into guiding the rescue party through the mountains, leaving his family alone at their cabin. During the journey, Lieutenant Mulvey orders the party to proceed through a sacred Crow burial ground against Johnson's advice. Afterward, Johnson returns home by the same route and notices that the graves are now adorned with Swan's blue trinkets; he rushes back to the cabin, where he finds that Swan and Caleb have been killed. Johnson sets off after the warriors who killed his family and attacks them, killing all but one, a heavy-set man who sings his death song when he realizes he cannot escape. Johnson leaves him alive, and the survivor spreads the tale of the mountain man's quest for revenge throughout the region, trapping Johnson in a feud with the Crow. The tribe sends its best warriors one at a time to kill Johnson, but he defeats each one. His legend grows, and the Crow come to respect him. He meets Gue again and returns to the cabin of Caleb's mother, only to find that she has died and a new settler named Qualen and his family are living there. Nearby the Crow have built a monument to Johnson's bravery, leaving trinkets and talismans as tribute. Johnson and Lapp meet for a final time. It is at this meeting that Lapp realizes the heavy toll that fighting an entire nation alone in a vast and lonesome frontier has taken on Johnson. Lapp indicates as much when he remarks that Johnson has \"come far\", to which Johnson replies \"Feels like far.\" Lapp then queries \"Were it worth the trouble?\" \"What trouble?\" Johnson replies. Later, Johnson has a wordless encounter with Paints-His-Shirt-Red, presumed to be behind the attacks. While sitting astride their horses far apart, Johnson reaches for his rifle, but Paints-His-Shirt-Red raises his hand, open-palmed, in a gesture of peace that Johnson returns, signaling an end to their conflict. The film ends with the song lyrics, \"And some folks say he's up there still.\"",

    "Synopsis": "In the 17th century, two Portuguese Jesuit priests, Rodrigo and Garupe, travel to Japan to proselytize despite a formal ban on the practice or promotion of Christianity. They also search for their mentor Ferreira, with whom they lost contact five years prior and presume is imprisoned. Rodrigo is patronizing and Garupe is cautious. The two priests are overwhelmed with the welcome they receive from the persecuted Japanese Christians, but occasionally wish for some comfort food from home. They travel to the village of Kichijiro, the fisherman who smuggled them into Japan from China. Returning, they learn that a detachment of Japanese officials and samurai have arrived to search for them. With most of their flock taken into custody or tortured for refusing to betray them, the two priests decide to leave but they become separated. Kichijiro finds Rodrigo and joins with him; he confesses to Rodrigo he is a weak man, and that his family was slaughtered for being Christians. Nagasaki Magistrate Inoue's men capture Rodrigo and throw 300 pieces of silver at Kichijiro (reminiscent of Judas Iscariot). He later gives away the money to a prostitute for emotional support. Inoue takes Rodrigo to Nagasaki and puts him on trial. Later, he and other prisoners are forced to watch as a Christian samurai family are publicly humiliated and threatened for practicing Christianity; the wife, Kiku, recants, and the husband is put to death for his defiance. Kichijiro, guilt-ridden for his treachery, sneaks into the holding cell, asks Rodrigo to forgive him. He says he betrayed Rodrigo because everyone shamed him for recanting his faith and so he despises anyone who reminds him of it. Inoue, through his interpreter, invites Rodrigo for a talk in private. Inoue says the Catholic Church is unwanted in Japan, comparing Rodrigo's faith to a concubine who makes trouble for a man's conscience. Rodrigo says the truth of the Church is universal and as the happiness between a man and woman is disturbed, the State disturbs the efforts of the Church to spread its teachings of peace and brotherhood. Each accuses the other of ignorance, but Inoue is eventually swayed somewhat by Rodrigo's conviction. Nonetheless, he is bound by the shogun's law to ban Christianity. Later Rodrigo is taken to the seaside and sees Garupe, who has been taken prisoner along with his Japanese companions. The interpreter tells Rodrigo that Inoue wants him to witness Garupe apostatizing his faith; if he fails to do so, the Japanese converts will be killed. While Garupe's companions are drowned one by one, the priest defies his captors, frees himself, and jumps into the sea. He tries to pull the drowning victims to safety but is stabbed at by spear-wielding samurai and slowly loses his strength until he drowns as well. Later, Rodrigo is taken to a Buddhist temple to visit Inoue's friend, Lord Chuan Sawano. Sawano turns out to be Ferreira, who has apostatized and is working under Inoue as an astronomy scholar, tasked with exposing errors and inconsistencies in the Bible and other Christian writings. Sawano advises his former student to renounce the Church and Christianity; Rodrigo rebukes him. Sawano says he preached in Japan for twenty years, and he knows this is not a land where Christianity can be rooted but a terrifying swamp where seedlings can rot and die and the inculturation of Christianity is the worst. Rodrigo rejects all these claims and censures him by saying that this wouldn't be the attitude of Saint Xavier. Rodrigo is then hung upside down in a pit with a small incision at the back of his ear for the blood to drip slowly. Sawano visits him and explains that three newly recanted Christian believers have been hung upside down next to him for the past six hours. Sawano says he was in the same cell where Rodrigo is now and was hung for two days and there were five men who were hung in the pit, and he can still hear their voices. The former priest admits that the real reason he renounced his faith was not because of the torture, but the absence of God in others' suffering. Rodrigo replies those who are in suffering will receive eternal happiness for their pain. Sawano mocks him, and notes that if Rodrigo sacrifices his faith for the sake of love, the other three men will be spared and given medical treatment. The interpreter comes with a fumi-e and encourages Rodrigo to step on it as Sawano watches and chants silently. Rodrigo steps on the fumi-e and a rooster crows twice (reminiscent of Saint Peter's denial). Later, a complacent Rodrigo is shown helping Inoue's officers to identify forbidden Christian objects being smuggled in by foreign ships. Rodrigo is asked to comment on a cup, and he says it's not a chalice because the stem would have been longer. He eventually becomes a samurai and is given Kiku as his wife; from that day forward, he is given her dead husband's name Sanemon Okada as Ferreira was given the title of Lord Sawano. A happy Kichijiro is shown sweeping the surroundings.",

    "Synopsis": "In Ilium, New York, the middle-aged Billy Pilgrim writes a letter to the editor claiming to have become \"unstuck in time\"; he finds himself as a young man behind enemy lines in Belgium during World War II, where he and some other American troops are captured by the Germans. A fellow prisoner of war, Paul Lazzaro, develops a grudge against Billy and vows to kill him; at a camp, Lazzaro attacks Billy but is intercepted by an older POW, Edgar Derby. Billy and Derby develop a friendship. The Americans are set to be transferred to Dresden for the duration of the war and are asked to elect a leader. When Lazzaro nominates himself, Billy nominates Derby for the role, and Derby is acclaimed after Lazzaro steps down. In Dresden, the POWs are placed in a slaughterhouse, Slaughterhouse-Five. During dinner, sirens sound off and the POWs head to shelter; the firebombing of Dresden commences, during which Billy believes 100,000 perish. The POWs emerge and the Germans have them sort through the ruins for survivors, warning looting will be punished. When Derby discovers a dancing figurine, he pockets it, and is executed by a Nazi firing squad. After the war, Billy marries the wealthy Valencia, whose father owns an optometry school, and Billy goes into the field. They have two children, Robert and Barbara. Robert becomes a troubled adolescent, at one point caught by the police vandalizing a Catholic cemetery. Billy bribes the police into letting Robert go. Billy and his father-in-law Lionel Merble board a private jet for an optometry convention. When Billy looks out the window and sees men in ski masks, he has a premonition the plane will crash en route, which it does. Lionel is killed but Billy is found alive and taken to hospital. On her way to the hospital, a distressed Valencia has multiple accidents and her car's exhaust is destroyed, causing her to die of carbon monoxide poisoning. Billy is released from the hospital and opts to live alone, over the objections of Barbara. Robert has reformed and enlisted for the Vietnam War. While alone, Billy is abducted to the alien planet of Tralfamadore, along with film actress Montana Wildhack. The Tralfamadorians live in the \"fourth dimension\" and teach Billy the universe is made up of random moments strung together; when one dies, they go back to another point in their life, and it is up to them to focus on good moments and ignore the bad. The Tralfamadorians hope Billy and Montana will mate. Billy and Montana fall in love and have a child, whom Montana names Billy Jr. On Earth, Billy argues with Barbara about the existence of Tralfamadore; Billy, being able to travel into the future as well as the past, shares a vision of his death, in which he is fatally shot by an elderly Lazzaro while giving a speech about Tralfamadore.",

    "film_title": "Solaris (1972 film)",
    "Synopsis": "Psychologist Kris Kelvin is about to be sent on an interstellar journey to evaluate whether a decades-old space station, positioned over the oceanic planet Solaris, should continue its research. He spends his last day on Earth with his elderly father and a retired pilot named Burton. Years earlier, Burton had been part of an exploratory team at Solaris but was recalled when he described strange happenings, including seeing a four-meter-tall child on the surface of the water on the planet. A panel of scientists and military personnel dismissed these visions as hallucinations, but now that the remaining crew members are making similarly strange reports, Kelvin's skills are needed. After leaving the house, Burton tells Kelvin that he recognized the child's face as that of one who was orphaned due to the disappearance of one of the Solaris explorers. Upon his arrival at the Solaris research station, he finds it in disarray. He soon learns that his friend among the scientists, Dr. Gibarian, has killed himself. The two surviving crewmen—Snaut and Sartorius—are erratic. Kelvin also catches fleeting glimpses of others aboard the station who were not part of the original crew. He finds that Gibarian left him a rambling, cryptic farewell video message, warning him about the strange things happening at the station. The video shows two appearances of a little girl who should not be aboard the station, with Gibarian asking Kelvin if he has seen her and insisting he is not insane, and should strange things happen to Kelvin, it will not be Kelvin having gone insane. After a fitful sleep, Kelvin is shocked to find Hari, his wife who died ten years earlier, sitting in his sleeping quarters. She is unaware of how she got there. Terrified by her presence, Kelvin launches the replica of his wife into outer space. Snaut explains that the \"visitors\" or \"guests\" began appearing after the scientists conducted radiation experiments, directing X-rays at the swirling surface of the planet in a desperate attempt to understand its nature. That evening, Hari reappears in Kelvin's quarters. This time, he calmly accepts her and they fall asleep together in an embrace. Hari panics when Kelvin briefly leaves her alone in the room, and injures herself attempting to escape. But before Kelvin can give first aid, her injuries spontaneously heal before his eyes. Sartorius and Snaut explain to Kelvin that Solaris created Hari from his memories of her. The Hari present among them, though not human, thinks and feels as though she were. Sartorius theorizes that the visitors, also called \"guests\", are not composed of atoms like regular humans, but are made of neutrinos, and that it might still be possible to destroy them through use of a device known as \"the annihilator\". Later, Snaut proposes beaming Kelvin's brainwave patterns at Solaris in hopes that it will understand them and stop the disturbing apparitions. In time, Hari becomes more human and independent and is able to exist away from Kelvin's presence without panicking. She learns from Sartorius that the original Hari had taken her own life ten years earlier. Sartorius, Snaut, Kelvin and Hari gather together for a birthday party, which evolves into a philosophical argument, during which Sartorius reminds Hari that she is not real. Distressed, Hari kills herself again by drinking liquid oxygen, only to painfully resurrect after a few minutes. On the surface of Solaris, the ocean begins to swirl faster into a funnel. Kelvin falls ill and goes to sleep. He dreams of his mother as a young woman, washing away dirt or scabs from his arm. When he awakens, Hari is gone; Snaut reads her farewell note, in which she explains how she petitioned the two scientists to destroy her. Snaut then tells Kelvin that since they have broadcast Kelvin's brainwaves into Solaris, the visitors have stopped appearing and islands have started forming on the planet's surface. Kelvin debates whether to return to Earth or remain on the station. Kelvin appears to be at the family home seen at the beginning of the film. He sinks to his knees and embraces his father. The camera slowly cranes away to reveal that they are on a Solaris island.",

    "Synopsis": "The film begins in 1962 with the recovery of the remains of Enrico Mattei, pilot Irnerio Bertuzzi, and American journalist William McHale, who crashed in Mattei's private plane in Bascapè, near Pavia, under unclear circumstances after a trip to Sicily. A flashback to 1945 reveals Mattei's appointment as commissioner of AGIP, tasked with selling it, but he defies orders and strengthens the company, making it a major European player. In 1970, filmmaker Francesco Rosi investigates Mattei's life, exploring political protection and a meeting with a U.S. oil magnate. In 1960, Mattei, cunning yet brilliant, brokers a Soviet oil deal, challenging the dominance of Anglo-American oil trusts. He aims to offer better terms to Arab and African oil-producing nations, straining relations with the \"seven sisters.\" The film then returns to 1970, when journalist Mauro De Mauro disappears. Authorities dismiss the Mattei connection, and the film recounts Mattei's final days in Sicily, including a crucial dinner and speech. In 1970, a suspect was arrested for De Mauro's disappearance, but journalists uncover a cover-up. Rosi interviews experts suggesting Mafia sabotage or foreign intelligence involvement in Mattei's plane crash. Witnesses remain silent. The film concludes by revisiting the 1962 plane crash, connecting to the film's opening. Mattei's voice echoes his determination to challenge the oil monopoly worldwide.",

    "Synopsis": "Following the death from accidental asphyxiation of Ralph Gurney, 13th Earl of Gurney, Jack Gurney becomes the 14th Earl of Gurney. Jack, a paranoid schizophrenic, thinks he is Jesus Christ and shocks his family and friends with his talk of returning to the world to bring it love and charity, not to mention his penchant for breaking out into song and dance routines and sleeping upright on a cross. When faced with unpalatable facts (such as his identity as the 14th Earl), Jack puts them in his \"galvanized pressure cooker\" and they disappear. His unscrupulous uncle, Sir Charles, marries him to his mistress, Grace, in hopes of producing an heir and putting his nephew in an institution; the plan fails, however, when Grace falls in love with Jack. Jack gains another ally in Sir Charles' wife, Lady Claire, who hates her husband and befriends Jack just to spite him. She also begins sleeping with Jack's psychiatrist, Dr. Herder, to persuade him to cure Jack quickly. Herder attempts to cure him through intensive psychotherapy, to no avail; Jack so thoroughly believes that he is the \"God of Love\" that he dismisses any suggestion to the contrary as insane. The night his wife goes into labour, Herder makes a last effort at curing Jack; he introduces Jack to McKyle, a patient who also believes himself to be Christ &ndash; or as the patient puts it, \"The High Voltage Messiah\" &ndash; who subjects an unwitting Jack to electroshock therapy. The plan works, and as Grace is delivered of a healthy baby boy, Jack proclaims \"I'm Jack, I'm Jack\". His family takes this to mean that he has returned to his senses, but in reality he now believes himself to be Jack the Ripper. Sir Charles sends for a court-appointed psychiatrist to evaluate Jack, confident that his nephew will be sent to an asylum for life. He is once again thwarted when the psychiatrist discovers that Jack was a fellow Old Etonian, bonds with him and declares him sane. Jack murders Lady Claire in a fit of rage when the ageing woman tries to seduce him. He frames the Communist family butler, Tucker, for the murder. Sir Charles suffers a debilitating stroke shortly afterward, and Dr. Herder has a nervous breakdown upon realizing what Jack has done. Jack assumes his place in the House of Lords with a fiery speech in favour of capital and corporal punishment. His colleagues applaud wildly, completely unaware the speech is the ranting of a lunatic. When seen through his eyes, his colleagues &ndash; singing \"Onward, Christian Soldiers\" &ndash; appear to be rotting corpses. Their enthusiasm contrasts with the unfavourable reaction when Jack believed he was Christ. That night, he murders Grace for expressing her love for him. Her terrified scream is matched by the sound of a baby cooing \"I'm Jack, I'm Jack\", suggesting that their son &ndash; the Heir apparent &ndash; has inherited Jack's madness.",

    "Synopsis": "Set in both Sicily and mainland Italy, the film follows the adventures of a man nicknamed Mimi. Mimi is a poor laborer who is pressured by his employers to vote for the mafia candidate in a local election. Frustrated by the system and assured that the ballot will be secret, Mimi votes for the communist representative instead. However he is fired and assured he will never work again as the ballot was not secret. Disgusted Mimi flees to Turin, while his wife, Rosalia, stays in Sicily. In Turin Mimi finds illegal construction work. When he witnesses one of the labourers falling to his death he helps the man into a van thinking that he is being taken to the hospital. When he discovers that his mafia bosses plan on dumping the body, Mimi tells him that his wife is the goddaughter of Liggio, a powerful mafioso. As a result, he is given a good union job at a factory. He also becomes further embroiled with the communist party. One day, Mimi sees the beautiful Fiore on the street, selling sweaters. When she and her friend are attacked he helps them and learns that she is a Trotskyist. When they walk in the park he sexually assaults and tries to rape her, but Fiore fends Mimi off and says that she is a virgin, and will not make love with a man until she falls in love. Mimi continues to see her until finally, heartbroken he tells her that he loves her, but cannot bear to be around her as he feels she will never return his love. Fiore finally tells Mimi she loves him. Aware that Mimi is married, Fiore nevertheless takes him as a lover. She becomes pregnant, giving birth to a son, Mimi. At the christening for their child, Mimi goes to get more champagne and happens upon a murder perpetrated by the mob. Though he is supposed to be shot, Mimi nevertheless ends up with only a scratch and, when the police question him, refuses to divulge any answers. As a result, he is promoted at work to a management job in Sicily. Terrified that his wife will discover his second family, Mimi hides Fiore and their child, and pretends to always be too tired for sex. That causes the townspeople to gossip, and begin to believe that Mimi is a homosexual. He is finally taken out by a few of his friends who tell him that Rosalia is pregnant with the child of another man, Amilcare. Mimi is outraged, and, after attacking Rosalia, tells her about Fiore and his son. Rosalia then decides to keep her child and refuses to divorce Mimi, gloating that her bastard child will bear his last name, while his son with Fiore will have a different name. To avenge his honour, Mimi attempts to rape and then seduces Amalia, the wife of Amilcare. After sleeping with her he informs her that Amilcare had impregnated his wife, Rosalia. Initially horrified, Amalia decides that the best way for the two of them to get back at their cheating spouses is to conceive a child together, leading to monthly visits between the two. When Amalia is several months pregnant, Mimi confronts her husband on the town steps, telling everyone there that Amalia is bearing Mimi's child. Enraged, Amilcare threatens to shoot Mimi, but Mimi is unconcerned; having considered the possibility, he warned Amalia to empty Amilcare's pistol. However, a man from the mafia, assigned to watch over Mimi, sees Amilcare reach for the pistol and shoots him, then shoves the smoking gun in Mimi's hand; Mimi is then jailed for Amilcare's murder. While in jail, Mimi is visited by a mafia man who informs him that, for taking the blame for the Amilcare murder, he is now a respected man and will be assured a job when he is released from jail. Mimi refuses; however, when released, Mimi is excited to see Fiore and little Mimi awaiting him. He is soon overwhelmed by Amalia and their child, and Rosalia's bastard son, all of whom clamor for him, calling him \"Papa\". In desperate need of money, Mimi goes to work for the mafia, promoting the election of Vico Tricarico. Disgusted that Mimi has abandoned his communist ideals, Fiore leaves him, taking young Mimi with her. Mimi chases after her, then collapses on the ground mourning his lost ideals.",

    "Synopsis": "Lulù Massa, 31 years old, has been working in the same factory for 15 years. Because the management uses his efficiency to justify their demands for higher output, he is disliked by his colleagues. Lulù cares neither for the unionists who demand higher pay rates and reduced working hours, nor the students outside the factory gates who appeal to the workers to rise up against the factory owners. From time to time, he visits his former colleague Militina who has been interred in a mental institution after collapsing under the working conditions. Militina fantasizes about militant actions and \"breaking the wall\". When Lulù loses a finger in a working accident, his attitude changes drastically. He joins a radical faction among the workers who call a strike, has an affair with a female co-worker and invites the students to move into his flat. As a result, his lover Lidia leaves him together with her son. After the unionists have reached an agreement with the management, the employees return to work, except Lulù who has been fired for his agitational behaviour. Lulù goes to see the student protestors, who declare that he is of no use for them because he is an individual case. Lulù, now on the verge of madness, only vaguely realises that Lidia and her son have moved back in and that the unionists have convinced the management to rehire him. Back in the factory, working in an assembly line with other colleagues, he recounts a dream in which he broke a wall, finding himself and his co-workers emerge from a fog.",

They seek out the advice of Dr. Katchaturian, a pharmacist. Rosalind naively tries to induce a miscarriage using old wives' tales such as drinking castor oil and even douching with soda pop. Resigned to an abortion before a family vacation in Mexico, she needs money. Andy tries to get some from the baby's father, Rick, a gigolo with whom Rosalind had a one-night stand. He fails, so he pawns a chemistry set, only to be mugged and robbed on the way home. In desperation, Andy goes to Rosalind's father, pretending he needs to borrow money for someone he has impregnated. Frank McCarthy obliges, but when he concludes that Rosalind is the one who needs the abortion, he orders Andy never to return to their house. Dr. Hargrave performs the abortion, after which Rosalind cavalierly offers Andy sex as her way of a thank-you.",

    "Synopsis": "Jean, a cynical, middle-aged film technician, is six years into an affair with Catherine, a much younger woman who works as a shop assistant. Though Jean is married to Françoise, his marriage has long since eroded into routine and detachment. He frequently claims he will leave his wife, but never follows through — a promise Catherine clings to with diminishing hope. The film opens in the middle of one of their many arguments. Catherine is tired of waiting for Jean to change, while Jean oscillates between affection, condescension, and cruel outbursts. Their time together is marked by impulsive trips, quiet dinners, and regular emotional breakdowns — mostly Jean’s. The relationship operates in cycles: Catherine threatens to leave, Jean begs her to stay, and they return to a fragile peace that inevitably fractures again. Catherine begins to grow more independent. She visits her family, where she receives warmth and support, and she begins to consider what life would be like outside Jean’s orbit. Jean, meanwhile, remains locked in his self-centered worldview — insisting he loves her, but unable to offer anything resembling stability or true commitment. At one point, Jean does separate from his wife, seemingly making good on his long-standing promise. But Catherine no longer sees this as the solution she once believed it to be. She has begun dating a new man — kind, calm, and emotionally available — and the contrast makes Jean’s erratic behavior even more apparent. In their final meeting, Jean tries to win her back. He assumes that now that he’s finally “free,” Catherine will come back to him. But she refuses. She’s not the same person who waited by the phone, who begged for scraps of attention. Quietly but firmly, she walks away from the relationship — and from Jean.",

    "film_title": "Ana and the Wolves",
    "Synopsis": "Ana, a young foreign governess, arrives at an isolated country estate in the arid region of Castile, near Madrid. She has come to look after three little girls whose mother, Luchy, greets her upon arrival. While Ana is unpacking, José, an uncle of the girls, introduces himself as the voice of order and authority in the family. If Ana runs into any problems she must go to him, he explains. A family dinner that evening gives Ana the chance to get to know her eccentric employers. The family consists of three middle age brothers (José, Juan and Fernando), their ailing mother, Juan’s wife Luchy, and the couple’s three daughters: Carlota, Victoria and Natalia. At night, Natalia wakes up screaming after a nightmare. Juan, the father of the three girls, lusting after Ana, takes advantage of the situation to enter her bedroom. Firmly but politely, she rejects his sexual advances. Dominated by an uncontrollable sex drive, the rejected Juan looks for consolation with Amparo, one of the maids. Ana starts receiving erotic letters signed by a secret admirer who desires to be with her. They are delivered with unusual postage stamps from distant places, each place closer than the last one. José explains to Ana that he has not only opened and read the letters, but that he knows who has been sending them. Juan, he tells her, has been writing them using the family's valuable collection of stamps to deceive her. José has set up a small museum of military outfits in his study and he offers Ana his protection and a small payment if she takes care of the uniforms. Fernando, the most subdued of the three brothers, has moved out of the main house to establish his residence in a nearby cave where he practices mystical incantations in an effort to levitate. Fernando intrigues Ana the most. She is both appalled by him and attracted to his way of life, as if understanding why he wants to escape from the world. Between bouts of epilepsy and gout, the ailing matriarch, Mama, remains the protectress of the family unit. When she and Ana engage in direct dialogue, the old dowager gives Ana a bit of the background about the three sons while showing the governess their childhood clothing, which she has saved for years. “You must be understanding with them,” Mama tells her. The absurdity of this strange family intrigues Ana all the more. Ana now actively leads the three brothers on, playing along with the fantasy life of each of one, sometimes outwardly mocking them. Recruited to help José with his museum when he shoots a flying bird to scare her, Ana is bemused and gives him a medal as a reward. Juan is so obsessed with Ana that at one point he sneaks into her bedroom to brush his teeth with her toothbrush. She is perplexed by his antics. To embarrass him she makes him open one of the letters and read it out loud. Later on, she kisses him and asks him if he is willing to leave his wife for her. When he says yes, she frightens him by calling his wife. Only with Fernando does Ana develop a more intimate (although still Platonic) relationship. The entire family goes to see Fernando at his cave. They are worried because he has refused to eat. Jose forces some food into his mouth, which Ana later takes out, realizing that he has not swallowed it. Looking for a missing doll, the three girls finally find it buried in mud with its hair cut off. The girls blame the wolves. Ana reports the incident to Juan, who explains that Fernando, who has a fetish for hair, is the culprit. Ana's presence has become so disturbing in the house that Luchy, Juan’s wife, wants to kill herself. When it becomes apparent that Ana has been leading her sons on by sowing doubts in their minds and endangering the unity of the family, Mama orders that she be dismissed. The three brothers waylay her on the road as she leaves the estate. All three assault her: forcing her to the ground, Fernando cuts off her hair; Juan rapes her; and José puts a pistol to her head and shoots her. The final freeze-frame is of Ana’s agonized face in a gruesome close-up.",

    "Synopsis": "John Wintergreen is a motorcycle cop who patrols the rural Arizona highways with his partner Zipper. Wintergreen is an experienced patrolman looking to be transferred to the Homicide unit. When he is informed by Crazy Willie of an apparent suicide-by-shotgun, Wintergreen believes the case is actually a murder as the victim was shot in the chest rather than the head, which is more usual. Detective Harve Poole agrees it is a homicide, after a .22 bullet is found amongst the pellets in the man's chest during the autopsy, as well as hearing about a possible missing $5,000 ($ today) from the man's home, and arranges for Wintergreen to be transferred to homicide to help with the case. Wintergreen gets his wish, but his joy is short-lived. He begins increasingly to identify with the hippies whom the other officers, including Detective Poole, are endlessly harassing. The final straw comes when Poole discovers that Wintergreen has been sleeping with his girlfriend, Jolene. The hostile workplace politics cause him to be quickly demoted back to traffic enforcement. While demoted, Wintergreen solves the murder. The killer is Willie, who confesses while Wintergreen goads him into talking about it. Wintergreen supposes Willie did it because he was jealous of the old man he killed, who frequently had young people over to his house to buy drugs. Shortly after, it is discovered that Zipper stole the $5,000, which he used to buy a fully dressed Electra Glide motorcycle. Upon this discovery, Zipper becomes distressed and belligerent and shoots at Wintergreen, striking an innocent bystander. Wintergreen shoots him square in the chest. Wintergreen, now alone and back on his old beat, runs into a hippie that Zipper was needlessly harassing earlier on a previous stop. Recognizing him, Wintergreen lets him off with a warning, but the hippie forgets his driver's license, and Wintergreen drives up behind his van to return it to him. The hippie's passenger points a shotgun out of the back window and shoots Wintergreen, killing him.",

    "Synopsis": "The voice of God opens the film, declaring his omnipotence: \"My name is Known: God and King. I am most in majesty, in whom no beginning may be and no end.\" In New York City, John the Baptist arrives and calls a youthful cast of disciples to Central Park, beckoning them to \"Prepare Ye, The Way of the Lord.\" He baptizes his congregation in the Bethesda Fountain. Jesus arrives and John baptizes Jesus, and the cast sings \"Save The People\" with Jesus. They arrive at a scrapyard, where Jesus declares he came not to \"abolish the law and the prophets but to complete.\" Jesus explains to the cast that those who keep the law will earn the highest place in the Kingdom of Heaven. The cast then acts out two parables, including the Pharisee and the Publican about a self-righteous Pharisee who thanks God he is not like other men, and the Parable of the Unforgiving Servant, which tells of a master who cancels his servant's debt. The servant then demands another man repay his owed debt in full. The master, hearing this, condemns the servant to prison. Jesus explains the moral: \"Forgive your brothers from your heart.\" The cast then sings \"Day by Day.\" After this, Jesus explains to his disciples to \"turn to them the other cheek,\" \"hand over your coat\" when they ask for your shirt, and walk with anyone for two miles. Jesus then teaches that no man can serve two masters (God and money). They arrive at the Andrew Carnegie Mansion and sing \"Turn Back, O Man.\" The cast next performs the Parable of the Good Samaritan, with Jesus concluding his message is to do good deeds in secret. Judas recites the parable of Lazarus and the rich man. On Earth, a rich man lives in luxury while Lazarus lives in poverty. Upon dying, Lazarus is rewarded in heaven. The rich man dies and is sent to hell, where he begs Abraham to have Lazarus warn his living brothers about their eternal fate. Abraham declines, stating if they are not convinced by Moses and the Prophets, they will never be convinced by Lazarus. The cast proceeds to sing \"Bless the Lord.\" Jesus and the disciples recite the Beatitudes. Judas directs the final beatitude regarding persecution at Jesus, and Jesus quickly changes the subject by instead singing \"All for the Best.\" Jesus teaches his next moral to pray for your enemies and bless those who persecute you. This is followed by the cast performing the Parable of the Sower, to which Jesus explains the seed is the Word of God. A disciple then tells a story of a man who spent a lifetime acquiring treasures, and then dies before he can enjoy them. Jesus subsequently explains that God provides for all, to which the cast sings \"All Good Gifts.\" At the Cherry Lane Theatre, the cast performs the parable of The Prodigal Son, complete with clips from several silent films. The cast next performs \"Light of the World,\" explaining that Christ's Light shines in each person. Aboard a vessel ship, the Pharisees ask Jesus multiple questions, including should they pay taxes to the government. Jesus answers to give respectively to God and men which is theirs'. The Pharisees leave and Jesus accuses them of being liars and hypocrites. Jesus predicts his impending death, to which the cast consoles him by singing \"By My Side.\" During the song, Judas foretells his betrayal of Jesus. They arrive on land and sing \"Beautiful City.\" At the Last Supper, Jesus tells them that one of them will betray him. Jesus tells Judas to do what he must do and Judas leaves. Jesus breaks the bread and shares the wine, and recites the traditional Seder blessings. As Jesus blesses each disciple, the song \"On the Willows\" plays. Jesus then leaves and prays to God that the cup will pass from him. Jesus returns to find his disciples are sleeping. He wakes them up, but they all fall asleep again. Jesus warns them they will all betray him three times. Judas returns with the police and embraces Jesus. Jesus is then held to an electric fence (representing the Cross), where he dies. The disciples carry Jesus's body as they reprise \"Day by Day.\"",

    "Synopsis": "Jeremy Jones (Benson) is a shy, bespectacled, Jewish fifteen-year-old living in a New York City apartment with his parents, who are busy with their own pursuits and leave him mostly on his own. He attends a private high school that focuses on the performing arts, where he is a serious student of cello who aspires to musical greatness. He has an after-school job as a dog walker. His other interests include reading poetry, playing chess and basketball, and following horse racing, where he can consistently pick winners, though he never places a bet himself. At school, he enters an empty classroom looking for chalk, sees a girl (O'Connor) inside practicing ballet, and is instantly smitten with her beauty. They talk briefly, but he is flustered and completely forgets to ask her name. He later learns she is a new student named Susan Rollins, and that she is older than he is, and in a higher grade. Jeremy follows her from a distance for a few days, but is too shy to approach her, so his more confident friend Ralph takes matters into his own hands and explains the situation to her, and she sends the message back to Jeremy that he should call her. However, Jeremy decides not to call after seeing her walking with a handsome older boy. Shortly afterwards, Susan attends a school recital where Jeremy plays the cello as a featured soloist. She is impressed by his playing and congratulates him afterwards, motivating him to finally call her and ask her out. On their first date, Jeremy finds out that Susan's mother is dead, and that she and her father just moved to New York from Detroit so her father could take a new job. Susan and Jeremy enjoy each other's company and they begin walking to school together every day, visiting places such as the park and racetrack, and generally spending a lot of time together for the next three weeks. Jeremy confides to Ralph that he is falling in love. One rainy afternoon while playing chess in Jeremy's room, Susan and Jeremy profess their love for each other and then make love for the first time. Susan then returns home, only to find that her father has been offered a better job back in Detroit, so they will be leaving New York immediately, within the next couple of days. Susan tries to explain to her father that she is in love with Jeremy, but her father doesn't take it seriously because he thinks that the \"three weeks and four days\" that Susan and Jeremy have been seeing each other is not long enough to form a deep relationship. The next day a tearful Susan tells Jeremy the news and he is likewise stunned. He tries to reach out to both his father and Ralph to talk with them about his feelings, but neither one is receptive. In the end, Susan and Jeremy sadly say goodbye at the airport and she departs, leaving Jeremy alone again.",

    "film_title": "La Grande Bouffe",
    "Synopsis": "The film tells the story of four friends who gather in a villa for the weekend, with the express purpose of eating themselves to death. Bouffer is French slang for \"eating\" (the Italian abbuffata means \"great eating\"). The first protagonist is Ugo, owner and chef of a restaurant, \"The Biscuit Soup\". The second is Philippe, a somewhat important magistrate who still lives with his childhood nanny, Nicole, who is overprotective of him to the point of trying to prevent him from having relationships with other women, and who fulfills her own sexual needs with him. The third character is Marcello, an Alitalia pilot and womaniser. The fourth and final main character is Michel, who is an effeminate television producer. The four come together by car to the beautifully furnished but unused villa owned by Philippe. There they find the old caretaker, Hector, who has innocently prepared everything for the great feast, and a Chinese visitor who is there to offer a job to the magistrate in faraway China, which Philippe politely rejects with the phrase \"Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes\" (\"Beware of Greeks bearing gifts\"), quoting Virgil. Once alone, the four begin their binge. In one scene, Marcello and Ugo race each other to see who can eat oysters faster. They discuss organizing a little \"feminine presence\" and decide to invite three prostitutes to come to the house the following evening (not four, because Philippe does not want to participate). Their breakfast next day is interrupted by the arrival of a school class who would like to visit the garden of the villa to see the famous \"linden tree of Boileau\", under which the French poet used to sit while looking for inspiration. The four willingly invite the class not only into the garden, but also to view the old Bugatti in the garage and to a magnificent lunch in the kitchen. Above all, they get to know Andrea, the young and buxom teacher, whom they spontaneously invite to dinner that evening. Philippe is dismayed at the notion of the school teacher being in the same company as three prostitutes; he warns her, but she appears not to be perturbed. The prostitutes arrive in due course and the atmosphere becomes frivolous and sexually charged, with each of the men howling throughout the film when they are overjoyed. Andrea arrives and embraces the spirit of the party. She is attracted to Philippe, who proposes to marry her. The eating continues unabated. Ugo is responsible for the preparation of the food. Michel, who seems to have been brought up strictly not to break wind, suffers from indigestion. His friends encourage him to let out whatever wind is trapped. Frightened and disgusted by the turn of events, the prostitutes flee at dawn and leave only Andrea. She seems to sense the purpose of the protagonists and decides to help them in their efforts, establishing a tacit agreement and remaining with them until the death of all four. She indulges in sex with all the men after the departure of the prostitutes, while joining them in their binge as well. The first to die is Marcello, after being enraged with his own impotence; he goes to the toilet and causes the sanitary pipes to explode. The bathroom is flooded with sewage, which leaks through the ceiling below, and leaves a noxious smell even after being cleaned up. He becomes exasperated, and realizing the futility of the farce, decides to leave the house at night during a snow storm, in the old Bugatti that he had repaired earlier in the day with great delight. His friends find him the next morning, frozen to death in the driving seat. The first suggestion is to bury Marcello in the garden, but on the advice of Philippe (who, being a judge, warns that there is a severe penalty for the illegal burying of a corpse), they place the body in the villa's cold room, where it remains seated and clearly visible from the kitchen. After Marcello comes Michel, who finds a new dog in the yard sitting in the Bugatti. Already suffering from indigestion and crammed to capacity with food (he cannot even lift his legs practising dance, his favourite pastime), he suffers an attack of bowel movements while playing the piano. Amid flatulence and worse, he is finally able to let it all go, and collapses on the terrace. His friends place him in the cold room next to Marcello. Shortly afterwards, the backyard dogs cause a stir (including another new dog) and Ugo prepares an enormous dish made from three different types of liver pâté in the shape of the Dome of Les Invalides, which he serves to the remaining diners, Philippe and Andrea, in the kitchen in view of the two dead friends. It is decorated with eggs, since Jews see them as symbols of death. However, Philippe and Andrea cannot bring themselves to eat it. Philippe goes off to bed, leaving Andrea to keep Ugo company during his determined effort to eat the entire pâté. Some time later, she later calls Philippe back downstairs to help her stop his friend from stuffing himself to death. They cannot dissuade Ugo, and end up attending to him on the kitchen table, the one feeding him, the other masturbating him until he orgasms and dies at the same time. On the advice of Andrea, his body is left on the kitchen table, in his \"domain\". The last to die is the diabetic Philippe, on the bench under the lime-tree of Boileau and into the arms of Andrea, after eating a pudding she has made shaped like a pair of breasts. He dies on the bench with Andrea and yet another dog who he keeps calling Ugo, just as another delivery of meat arrives. The delivery men react with incomprehension when Andrea instructs them to leave the meat – whole animals, and sides of pork and beef – in the garden (the kitchen and the cold room now containing the bodies of Ugo, Marcello and Michel). The film ends bizarrely with a scene of the garden filled with dogs who begin chasing and dining on the poultry and meat carcasses.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1932, after witnessing the murder of his anarchist friend at the hands of the Fascist police for plotting to assassinate Benito Mussolini, Antonio \"Tunin\" Soffiantini, a peasant farmer from northern Italy, resolves to carry out his friend's mission. After training in marksmanship in Paris with the anarchist underground, he travels to Rome and settles into Madame Aida's brothel while posing as the cousin of one of the prostitutes, Salomè, who is his secret political contact. Salomè explains to Tunin that she seeks to avenge the lynching of her anarchist lover, Anteo Zamboni, who was framed for an attempt on Mussolini's life in Bologna. Salomè arranges for her, Tunin and Tripolina, a younger prostitute at the brothel, to spend the day with the head of Mussolini's secret police, Giacinto Spatoletti, from whom she has been extracting vital information for the past three months, so they can learn Spatoletti's upcoming security arrangements. The four of them go to the countryside near Rome where the assassination is due to take place in a few days' time. Salomè keeps Spatoletti busy while Tunin surveys the area and devises a plan. After striking up a conversation, Tunin and Tripolina develop feelings for one another and subsequently sleep together. Back in Rome that night, Salomè and Tripolina return to the brothel while Spatoletti takes Tunin to the Piazza del Campidoglio, where the two men drink as Spatoletti expresses his admiration for Mussolini and his disdain for socialists and anarchists. When Spatoletti makes crude remarks about Tripolina, Tunin admonishes him and runs towards the brothel, yelling Tripolina's name, but the madams throw him out. The next day, Tunin reveals his assassination plot to Tripolina and asks her to spend the next two days with him, as he fears they may be his last, leaving her devastated. When an important client dies suddenly at the brothel, Madame Aida, hoping to avoid a scandal, assigns Tunin to discreetly dump the client's corpse in the Roman Forum, which he does with help from Salomè. In exchange, Madame Aida allows Tripolina to spend the next two days with Tunin. On the morning of the planned assassination, Tripolina refuses to awaken Tunin, fearing he will die, which leads to a heated argument with Salomè, who insists that he execute the plan, but the two eventually agree to protect him. Tunin awakens and, realising he is late, angrily accuses both women of betrayal. When the police conduct a routine patrol at the brothel, an increasingly paranoid Tunin confesses his intention to kill Mussolini and opens fire on the police, killing a few officers. He then tries to shoot himself but has run out of bullets. While attempting to escape, he is apprehended outside the brothel as Salomè, Tripolina and the other prostitutes watch in horror. Tunin is subjected to torture and interrogation by Spatoletti, but refuses to speak. He is subsequently beaten to death by Fascist officers in his jail cell. The police report describes his death as an \"unidentified madman's\" suicide.",

    "film_title": "O Lucky Man!",
    "Synopsis": "The film is prefaced by a short story that begins \"Once Upon a Time\", a silent, black-and-white film that depicts an unnamed country filled with peasant labourers. They pick coffee beans while armed foremen push rudely between them. One worker (McDowell with black hair and a mustache) pockets a few beans for himself (\"Coffee for the Breakfast Table\"), but he is discovered by a foreman. He is next seen before a fat magistrate who slobbers as he removes his cigar only to say \"Guilty.\" The foreman draws his machete and lays it across the unfortunate labourer's wrists, bound to a wooden block, revealing that he is to lose his hands for the theft of a few beans. The machete rises and falls, and the labourer draws back in a silent scream. The scene blacks out and the title \"NOW\" appears onscreen and quickly expands to fill it. During his journey, Michael Arnold \"Mick\" Travis slowly learns the lesson (reinforced by numerous songs in the soundtrack by Alan Price), that he must abandon his principles in order to succeed in life. Nevertheless, unlike the other characters he meets, he retains a detached idealism that allows him to distance himself from the evils of the world. Initially, Travis is motivated only by money and material wealth. He begins by working as a coffee salesman, working for Imperial Coffee in North East England. He is seduced by the firm's human resources manager, Rachel Roberts. He travels to a hotel in the north east, where a tailor gifts him a golden suit, and he sleeps with the hotel manager, Mary MacLeod. While there, he's told to travel to Scotland as part of his job. He loses his way, and is arrested and tortured in a government installation. He's made to sign a confession, which makes it seem that he's been working for a foreign power for three years. The installation comes under what seems like a military attack, and he escapes through a burnt and blasted landscape. Coming across a church celebrating the harvest festival, he's found eating the harvest offerings by the vicar's wife, who instead offers him her breast to suckle on. She then gives him directions ('go south; there's nothing in the north for a boy like you'). Hitching a lift to London, he's offered £150 to participate in research at a private medical clinic. On arrival, he learns that they intend to sterilise him. He hides in the room of another patient, who he finds has had his head transplanted onto a cow-like animal. He jumps from a window, and catches a lift with a band who're heading for London. He meets Patricia, who takes him back to the band's flat. In parallel with Travis's experiences, the narration shows 1960s Britain slowly retreating from its imperial past but retaining some influence by means of corrupt dealings with the foreign dictators of countries that had recently fought for their independence. After finding out his girlfriend Patricia is the daughter of Sir James Burgess, an evil industrialist, Travis is appointed Burgess' personal assistant. Burgess is allied with Dr. Munda, the dictator of Zingara (a fictional African country), who has created a brutal police state and playground for wealthy people from the developed world. Burgess sells the regime a chemical called \"PL45 'Honey'\", which the dictator sprays on rebel areas; its effects resemble those of napalm. When public outcry goes international, Burgess conspires to convict Travis of fraud. Travis is imprisoned for five years. Five years later Travis has finished his sentence, become a model prisoner, and converted to humanism. He is quickly faced with a bewildering series of assaults upon his new-found idealism (\"Look Over Your Shoulder\"). While stopping at a slum on the outskirts of London he finds out that Patricia and her wealthy husband — whom Patricia married for financial stability while cheating on him with Travis — have lost all of their money and are living in extreme poverty. Travis' misadventures culminate in him being attacked by down-and-outs he had been trying to help. Becoming despondent and wandering the streets, the now-destitute Travis inadvertently becomes involved in a casting call for a film production (with Lindsay Anderson himself playing the director of the film). He is given various props to handle, including a stack of schoolbooks and a Bren light machine gun (both reminiscent of Mick Travis' first chapter in the trilogy, if....). The director believes he has found the protagonist for his new film in Travis, but when asked to smile for his screen test Travis, failing to understand what is being asked of him, is befuddled and repeatedly asks why he should smile since he feels he has no reason to do so. Suddenly, the director slaps Travis with his script book, and Travis, having an epiphany, slowly begins to smile. After a cut to black (a device used throughout the film) Travis, wearing the golden suit, is shown dancing at a raucous party (\"O Lucky Man!\"), which includes all of the film's cast celebrating and finally balloons descending from the ceiling.",

Lion is traveling to Detroit to see a child whom he has never met and make amends with the child's mother, Annie, to whom he has sent all of the money that he had earned while at sea. Max agrees to take a detour on his way to Pittsburgh, where the bank to which Max has been sending all his seed money is located. While visiting Max's sister in Denver, the pair's antics land them in a prison farm for a month. Max blames Lion for their incarceration and shuns him. Lion is befriended by an inmate named Riley, who eventually tries to sexually assault and physically ravage him. When Lion resists, Riley beats him, breaks his teeth and blinds him in one eye, which emotionally traumatizes him. Max rekindles his friendship with Lion and becomes his protector, eventually exacting revenge by fighting Riley. After their release, Max and Lion continue to have a profound effect on each other, although they have both undergone personal transformations, and their roles have shifted. Lion is still traumatized, no longer carefree nor able to smile, and Max loosens his high-strung aggression, performing a mock striptease to defuse a fight at a bar and make Lion laugh again. When Max and Lion finally arrive in Detroit, Lion finds a payphone and calls Annie, now married to another man and raising the five-year-old son of Lion. Annie is still furious with Lion for having abandoned her, and lies that she miscarried their son. Lion is devastated but feigns joy with Max about having a son. Shortly afterward, Lion experiences a psychological breakdown while playing with children in a city park, and becomes catatonic. Max makes a promise to Lion, now in a psychiatric hospital, that he will do anything to help him and boards a train to Pittsburgh with a round-trip ticket.",

The owner of a smart hire car, former sergeant-major Ledbetter, chauffeurs her to her unsympathetic mother in Bath. Hired to take her on outings, he becomes the only person she can talk to as she slowly lifts out of deep depression. When he takes her to a boxing night at a boys' club that he helps to run, she meets another committee member, the young former officer Cantrip. Like Ledbetter, he is struggling to return to normalcy, in his case, politics, after his traumatic experiences in the war. Cantrip starts wooing the wealthy Lady Franklin while still sleeping with his lover Connie, who is likely a war widow. Ledbetter's mental equilibrium becomes progressively more fragile. His business is failing, his casual relationship with the waitress Doreen brings no joy, his deepening affection for Lady Franklin is no longer returned, and his rage against his more successful rival is intensified by Cantrip's concealed involvement with Connie. When he finally confronts Cantrip and Lady Franklin together, they tell him that he has no place in their lives because they have become engaged. Leaping into his Rolls-Royce and swigging frequently from a bottle of alcohol, he drives blindly back to his garage and proceeds to run amok in the little courtyard, driving heedlessly back and forth into the walls and reversing and on and on like an animal in a frenzy in a cage.",

When he arrives at the hospital, he finds the entire facility is going to ruin and no one seems to be in charge or even caring for the patients. Time appears to behave in unpredictable ways, reanimating the past in an elaborate artificial caprice. Though Joseph is always shown as an adult, his behavior and the people around often depict him as a child. He befriends Rudolf, a young boy who owns a postage stamp album. The names of the stamps trigger a wealth of association and adventure in Joseph. Among the many occurrences in this visually potent phantasmagoria include Joseph re-entering childhood episodes with his wildly eccentric father (who lives with birds in an attic), being arrested by a mysterious unit of soldiers for having a dream that was severely criticized in high places, reflecting on a girl he fantasized about in his boyhood and commandeering a group of historic wax mannequins. Throughout his strange journey, an ominous blind train conductor reappears like a death figure. He also has a series of reflections on the Holocaust that were not present in the original texts, reading Schulz's prose through the prism of the author's death during World War II and the demise of the world he described.",

    "Synopsis": "Alexandre is an unemployed young intellectual, possibly a journalist, living a rudderless life in Paris. Subtly but entirely self-absorbed, Alexandre spends most of his days lecturing his companions on political and philosophical topics, including his opinions on contemporary films, such as The Working Class Goes to Heaven, and his memories of the May '68 protests. He lives with his lover, Marie, who works at a dress shop and responds to his continuous apathy towards her with angry invective that masks her deep feelings for him. When Alexandre attempts to persuade an ex-girlfriend, Gilberte, to marry him, she chooses instead to marry another man. Alexandre then heads to the popular Les Deux Magots café, where he gets the phone number of a woman leaving. The two eventually go on a date. Her name is Veronika, a Polish-French anaesthesia nurse who lives at the Hôpital Laennec. Priding herself on her promiscuity and her status as a liberated woman, Veronika makes advances towards Alexandre, eventually seducing him. Marie immediately sees through Alexandre's clumsy attempts to hide his affair, treating him with increasing fury that only subsides when they have sex. When Marie goes on a business trip to London, Alexandre takes Veronika to his apartment and sleeps with her in the bed he shares with Marie. After each tryst, Alexandre lectures the women on various topics while playing classical and pop music on his record player. Eventually, Veronika visits Alexandre’s apartment while drunk. She arrives to find him and Marie naked in bed and hurls insults at both of them. The three quickly begin a ménage à trois, sharing the same bed. Although Marie and Veronika claim to enjoy the polyamorous relationship, each secretly competes for Alexandre’s undivided affection. After Alexandre reacts poorly to Marie inviting one of her ex-lovers to a party, the relationship deteriorates rapidly. At the Café Flore, Veronika scathingly criticises Alexandre’s attitude towards women, accusing him of not loving her—or anyone—the way she loves him. Later, Marie attempts to commit suicide with sleeping pills, but Alexandre stops her in time. This prompts Veronika to break down, delivering a lengthy monologue about how promiscuous women are perceived as \"whores\" and rejecting some of her \"liberated\" political beliefs. She also tells Alexandre that she might be pregnant with his child. Alexandre decides to take Veronika back to her apartment at the hospital, leaving Marie sobbing alone in the flat. After dropping Veronika off, he storms back into her apartment and asks her to marry him. Veronika breaks down, crying and laughing simultaneously, and claims she is going to throw up. Feeling what might be morning sickness, she tells Alexandre that, if he really wants to help, he can fetch a dish for her to be sick in. Alexandre complies, then sits down on the floor, overwhelmed and distraught.",

    "film_title": "Arabian Nights (1974 film)",
    "Synopsis": "The main story concerns an innocent young man, Nur-e-Din (Franco Merli), who comes to fall in love with a beautiful slave girl, Zumurrud (Ines Pellegrini), who selected him as her master. After a foolish error of his causes her to be abducted, he travels in search of her. Meanwhile, Zumurrud manages to escape and, disguised as a man, comes to a far-away kingdom where she becomes king. Various other travellers recount their own tragic and romantic experiences, including a young man who becomes enraptured by a mysterious woman on his wedding day, and the prince Shazaman (Alberto Argentino), who wants to free a woman from a demon (Franco Citti) and for whom two women sacrifice their lives. Interwoven are Nur-e-Din's continuing search for Zumurrud and his (mostly erotic) adventures. In the end, he arrives at the far-away kingdom and is reunited with Zumurrud. The film comprises 16 scenes: Truth lies not in one dream, but in many dreams. - verse from the 1001 Nights and opening title * Lady of the Moons: The slave girl Zumurrud is being sold in the marketplace. Her present owner allowed her to choose her new master. Man after man offers to buy her but she refuses. An older man offers to buy her but she laughs and insults his erectile dysfunction. She spots the youth Nur-ed-Din and promises to be his slave. They go back to Nur-ed-Din's home and make love. * Zumurrud's story: Zumurrud tells her first story-within-the-story about the bisexual poet Sium from Ethiopia of the royal court. This segment is based on the poetry of Abu Nuwas. The king spots a woman bathing naked and is sad he has to leave. He asks Sium to compose a poem on the spot about the experience. Afterwards, Sium goes into the town where he propositions three boys for sex. Later, the king and the woman he saw bathing earlier find two youths, a boy and a girl, and drug them with potions. They leave them asleep naked in the same tent on separate cots. They make a bet that whichever of the pair falls in love is the inferior one, as the weaker falls in love with the beautiful. In turn, they wake both the boy and the girl, and both attempt to masturbate on the other's naked body. In the end, Sium and the woman admit there is no clear winner and they leave. Zumurrud is finished with her story and has completed a tapestry. She tells Nur-ed-Din to sell it in the market to anyone except a blue-eyed European man. Nur-ed-Din goes to the market and falls for the blue-eyed man's high offer. The man follows Nur-ed-Din back to his home and asks to share food. He drugs Nur-ed-Din with a banana and steals Zumurrud when he is asleep. The blue-eyed man brings Zumurrud to the old man from the marketplace, and he beats her for having mocked him. * Nur-e-din's search: Nur-ed-Din is very distressed when he awakens. A female stranger offers to help him. She discovers where Zumurrud is and tells Nur-e-din to wait outside the old man's gate when he is asleep. Zumurrud will jump over the wall and abscond with him. He waits deep into the night but falls asleep. A passing Kurd steals his money and his turban. Zumurrud jumps over the wall and mistakes the Kurd for Nur-ed-Din. The Kurd brings her back to his hideout, where he says his friends will gang rape her. She is chained up but manages to escape the next day and leaves into the desert disguised as a soldier. * Crowned King: Zumurrud rides through the desert and arrives outside a city guarded by several soldiers and a crowd of people. She claims to be a soldier named Wardan. The people, believing her to be a man, tell her that after the king passes without an heir, their tradition is to crown the first traveller who comes to their city. She is also given a bride. On her wedding night, Zumurrud reveals her secret to the bride. The bride promises to keep her secret. The European man and the Kurd travel to the city and are summarily executed on Wardan s orders. The people they were eating with mistakenly believe this is punishment for stealing a handful of their rice. * Dream: This segment is based on the story of the Porter and the three ladies of Baghdad from Night 9. Nur-ed-Din is mistaken for a porter by a veiled woman. She hires him to collect various foods and dishes from the market to bring home for her and her two sisters. They return home, set the table and begin reading. In the story-within-the-story, Princess Dunya dreams about a female dove helping her male counterpart fly free from a net. The female is then caught in a net and the male flies off alone. She takes the meaning of this dream as the infidelity of men and vows to never marry. * Aziz and Aziza: Dunya picks up a book and reads a story. The next story is based on the Aziz and Aziza story that begins on Night 112. Aziz (Ninetto Davoli) is telling his friend, Prince Tagi, about his life. He was set to be married to his cousin Aziza, but on the wedding day, he is distracted by a mysterious woman he meets by chance, when he sits under her window. The woman communicates to him in scant gestures. He is smitten with this woman and goes to Aziza to figure out what to do. Aziza helps decode the messages and tells him how to reply and what poetry to recite. After a rough start, the woman responds to Aziz who looks forward to their meeting in a tent outside the city. * Love is my Master: Aziz goes to the tent and drinks some wine which puts him to sleep. The woman leaves a sign that she will murder him if he does something so careless again. He goes back and abstains from eating this time. The woman (named Budur) comes and they make love. Aziz recites the poetry Aziza told him to. He returns home and Aziza is on the roof, crushed with loneliness, but Aziz does not seem to care. He only wants Budur. Aziza gives him more poetry to recite. Aziz returns to Budur and after they sleep together, he shoots an arrow with a dildo into her vagina. Aziz goes home to rest while Aziza cries again. Aziz goes to Budur the next day and recites more poetry but she scolds him. She says the meaning of the poem is that the girl who gave it loved him and has committed suicide. She tells him to go to her grave. He goes and his mother tells him to mourn faithfully but he clearly has little interest in this. * Weep as you made her weep: Aziz returns to Budur the next day but she is very distraught. She gives him a large sum of money and tells him to erect a monument in Aziza's honor, but he spends all the money on alcohol. After leaving the bar, he is kidnapped by a young woman and her hired thugs. The woman orders him to marry her or Budur, whom he was visiting will kill him. He spends a year with her and fathers a child but he leaves one day on the pretext of visiting his mother. He instead goes to see Budur, who is sitting outside her tent. He asks why she is sitting alone. She responds she has sat alone for one year, not moving an inch, waiting for him. When Aziz tells her he is married and has a child now, Budur tells him he is useless to her now. However, she calls some other women and they surround him with knives. He yells out the last poem Aziza gave him and they are forced to halt. Budur says she won't kill him and that Aziza has saved him this time but that he will not leave unharmed. She ties a rope around his genitalia and castrates him. Aziz returns to his mother who gives him a message from the deceased Aziza. A tapestry he believed was made by Budur was actually made by a woman named Princess Dunya. Prince Tagi hears all this and is moved. He wants to meet Dunya as he has fallen in love with her without even meeting her. * Garden: The two travel to Dunya's city where she has walled herself off in her palace. They ask the gardener for a tour and he obliges. He says Dunya had a dream about a dove that was betrayed by her male counterpart and has vowed to have nothing to do with men. The two want to meet her under the guise of posing as painters. They plan on hiring two other painters to help them with this disguise. The two are offered seven, eight and even 9 dinars but they refuse to work for anything above one dinar. * The Painter's story: The men are all painting and working in the palace. Aziz's friend asks the first one what his story is and he replies that he was once a prince who managed to survive a battle by covering himself in a corpse's blood and pretending to be one of the dead. After the enemy leaves, he runs off to a new city to hide. He asks for work and says he knows a lot about philosophy, science, astronomy, medicine and law. The man tells him this is useless to him and the prince will work cutting wood. * Prince Shahzaman: This is an adaptation of the second dervish's tale from Nights 12 and 13. Prince Shahzaman and his entourage are attacked by robbers. He plays dead and thus survives the attack. Shahzaman goes out to cut wood and accidentally finds a trap door in the ground. He walks down the stairs and finds a beautiful girl trapped underground by a jinn. She tells him that the jinn only comes once every ten days or when she slaps the golden sign above her bed that tells him that she needs him. The prince sleeps with her and he proudly holds his erection in his hand as he announces that he will free her from the jinn. Against her wishes, he hits the golden sign in order to kill the jinn. The prince immediately regrets this and leaves without his shoes before the jinn arrives. The girl tries to explain things to the jinn, that it was only an accident but the jinn realizes she was sleeping with someone when he spies the prince's shoes. He goes out searching for the prince by asking people if they know who the shoes belong to and someone replies yes much to the jinn's happiness. The jinn takes the prince back to the cave and attempts to make the prince kill the girl with a sword but the prince is afraid to do it, having just slept with the girl. He also asks the girl to kill the prince but she refuses. Angered and realizing neither will do it, the jinn then chops the girl into pieces himself and takes the prince away to exact his revenge. The jinn tells him that he will not kill him but will transform him into a monkey as punishment for what he has done. The monkey then is picked up by travellers on a ship though it is unknown to them that he was once a man. The travellers are amazed when the monkey takes a paper and brush from them and writes down poetry in beautiful calligraphy. The travellers land at port and go to the king with the paper. The king asks to find whoever wrote such beautiful poetry and throw him a celebration. The people throw a celebration for the monkey. The monkey is adorned with robes and is carried on a litter to the king's surprise. The king's daughter who is knowledgeable of sorcery understands that he was once a man and transforms him back, killing herself in the process. She goes up in flames and only ashes remain of her. Her father, who allowed her to commit suicide, now wants to give the prince a rich gift. But Prince Shahzaman thanks the king for his daughter's self-sacrifice and says he now wants to return to his kingdom. * Yunan's story: This is an adaptation of the third dervish's story from Nights 14 and 15. In far east Asia, Prince Yunan lives in contentment with his father, the King. Yunan decides to go on a voyage to islands within his kingdom but the ship is blown off course in a storm. He asks the crew why they are crying and they tell him there is an island with a \"magnetic mountain\" that they are approaching. It will pull all the nails out of their ship and send them to their deaths among the rocks. The ship crashes as they explain but Yunan survives. He hears a voice telling him to grab a bow and arrow buried under the sand and shoot the stone knight statue bearing the cursed talisman that is planted on the peak of the island. He shoots it as he is told and the entire island collapses into the sea. Yunan survives though and drifts among the waves with a piece of wood from his destroyed ship. * Chamber in the sand: Yunan drifts to another island where he sees a ship disembarking. He runs but it is too late. He finds a chamber on the island and goes inside to find a young boy. The young boy tells him that he is the son of a king and it was foretold by a soothsayer that on that very day he would be killed by a prince named Yunan and so his father took him to the remote island and built a chamber to keep him in until the dangerous time passed. Yunan hears this and tells him he will not hurt him but will only protect him. They bathe together and then go to sleep but during his sleep, Yunan begins sleepwalking and grabs a knife. He stabs the boy with the knife, killing him. The ending of this story is changed from in the book where the prince accidentally kills the boy while trying to cut a lemon. * Dream revealed: This segment is based on the porter's story in Night 9. Nur-ed-Din is bathing naked with the three sisters, who are also naked. They are a bit drunk and messing around with each other. One by one, the women ask Nur-ed-Din what their vaginas are called. He answers but they keep telling him he's got the wrong names. The right names are meadowed grass, sweet pomegranates, and the Inn of Good Food. He then asks them what the name of his penis is and each provides an answer though he says they are incorrect. Its name is \"the donkey which grazes perfumed meadowed grass, eats peeled sweet pomegranates and spends the night in the Inn of Good Food\". He then wakes up the next morning in the terrace outside the women's house. He continues on his search for Zummurrud. * Nur-e-din and Zumurrud: Nur-ed-Din reaches the city where Zummurrud rules. He grabs a handful of rice from the bowl where people are eating and is taken away to the king's private chamber. Zummurrud (still in disguise) asks him for anal intercourse. He meekly accepts and pulls down his pants. She pulls off her disguise and reveals it was only a joke. They are reunited and they embrace.",

    "Synopsis": "Giza resides not far from Munich with her son Michael, his wife, and their two grandchildren. Having migrated from Hungary to the Federal Republic, she now finds herself in retirement. Her health, though not perfect, is manageable. She maintains lively correspondence with her younger sister Erzsi, who remains in Budapest, working as a music teacher. Additionally, Giza cooks for a younger married doctor couple. Despite being widowed, she enjoys occasional dinner invitations from her daughter. However, her daughter, Ilona, married to the doctor Joseph, has yet to have children. Erzsi, feeling somewhat redundant, rarely engages in phone conversations with her sister. Erzsi is on a quest for a specific photo depicting both sisters during their youth. Unfortunately, Giza does not possess the photo and suspects it may have been lost. Erzsi shares tales of Paula in her letters to Giza, whom she has recently reunited with. In the past, Paula had saved Erzsi and her husband Béla from starvation during World War II. Presently, Paula wields a significant influence over Erzsi, persuading her to dye her hair and gifting her a dress. Giza, observing from a distance, feels pangs of jealousy but later apologises in a subsequent letter. On the other hand, Erzsi discloses to Paula in one of their meetings her affection for opera singer Viktor Csermlényi and her deep-rooted passion for music. Erzsi and Viktor have been romantically involved since their youth, maintaining their affair even after Erzsi's marriage to Béla. Only after Béla underwent a complicated surgery did Erzsi sever ties with Viktor. However, they continue to meet every Thursday, where Erzsi prepares meals for him. Their love endures, albeit unspoken. Accompanied by her music class, Erzsi attends a performance of Boris Godunov. However, she abruptly leaves shortly after the performance commences, unable to endure the music—Viktor had once portrayed the role, delivering one of his finest performances. Upon returning home, she encounters Viktor, who presents her with roses and sings for her. Despite Viktor's insistence that, at 71, he no longer possesses the same vocal prowess, Erzsi finds it disheartening to witness his decline. Soon thereafter, her professional life faces upheaval. Incensed by Erzsi's absence during the opera, her students intentionally perform poorly during a recital in front of the school principal. Consequently, the principal suggests Erzsi consider retirement in the fall. Shortly after, Erzsi accompanies Paula to Viktor's concert. Paula expresses a desire to meet the renowned singer. Later, Erzsi learns from Viktor himself that he escorted Paula home via taxi. They engaged in a lengthy conversation. Jealous and hurt, Erzsi initially contemplates canceling a planned dinner on Thursday but ultimately relents. However, she is informed by Viktor that a rehearsal unexpectedly prolonged, preventing his attendance. Enraged, Erzsi discards the meal. Subsequently, her maid Mousey expresses concern to Giza, suspecting Erzsi may be on the brink of a nervous breakdown. Despite Giza's attempts to persuade her to relocate, Erzsi adamantly refuses, preferring to spend her final days in Budapest. In receipt of a prescription for new sleeping pills from her brother-in-law, Erzsi ceases correspondence and disconnects the phone. Giza pens a letter to Mousey, informing her of an upcoming surgical procedure in two days' time. Meanwhile, Erzsi initiates numerous letters to Giza, none of which are dispatched. In these missives, she recounts an encounter with Viktor and Paula during a meal, during which she succumbed to rage, overturning the tableware, and leaving abruptly. Viktor remained unresponsive to subsequent calls, and attempts to converse with him at his concerts proved futile. Erzsi confesses her love for Viktor to Giza, entreating assistance in organizing a concert tour for him across the Federal Republic. Following days of lethargy spent in bed, composing unfinished letters, Erzsi consumes an overdose of sleeping pills. Though she collapses, she miraculously survives. A telegram from her nephew delivers the somber news of Giza's passing. Shortly thereafter, Paula dispatches a letter to Erzsi containing the long-sought photo, discovered amongst Viktor's belongings. Erzsi, in a gesture of closure, addresses the photo to Giza before dispatching it at the post office.",

    "Synopsis": "The Mirzas are a Muslim family living in a large ancestral house and running a shoe manufacturing business in the city of Agra in the United Provinces of northern India (now the state of Uttar Pradesh). The story begins in the immediate aftermath of India's independence and the partition of India in 1947. The family is headed by two brothers; Salim (Balraj Sahni), who heads the family business, and his elder brother Halim, who is mainly engaged in politics and is a major leader in the provincial branch of the All India Muslim League, which led the demand for the creation of a separate Muslim state of Pakistan. Salim has two sons, the elder Baqar, who helps him in the business, and Sikander (Farooq Shaikh), who is a young student. Halim's son Kazim is engaged to Salim's daughter, Amina. Although he had publicly promised to stay in India for the sake of its Muslims, Halim later decides to quietly emigrate to Pakistan with his wife and son, believing that there was no future for Muslims in India. Salim resists the notion of moving, believing that peace and harmony would return soon, besides which, he has to care for their ageing mother, who refuses to leave the house of her forefathers. This puts Kazim and Amina's marriage plans on hold, although Kazim promises to return soon to marry her. Halim's stealthy migration affects Salim's standing in the community. In the aftermath of partition, the sudden migration of many Muslims from Agra left banks and other lenders deeply reluctant to lend money to Muslim businessmen like Salim Mirza, who had previously been held in high esteem, over fears that they would leave the country without repaying the loan. Unable to raise capital to finance production, Salim Mirza's business suffers. Salim Mirza's brother-in-law, formerly a League supporter, now joins the ruling Indian National Congress in an attempt to get ahead in independent India, while his son Shamshad unsuccessfully woos Amina, who is still devoted to Kazim and hopeful of his return. Halim's migration to Pakistan makes the family home an \"evacuee property\" as the house is in Halim's name and Halim did not transfer it to Salim Mirza. The Indian government mandates the take over of the house, forcing Salim Mirza's family to move out of their ancestral home, which is very hard on Mirza's aged mother. Salim's wife blames him for not raising this issue with his brother Halim before he left for Pakistan. Mirza resists his wife's hints that they also move to Pakistan and his elder son's calls for modernizing the family business. Mirza finds it difficult to rent a house, facing discrimination owing to his religion and fears that a Muslim family would skip out on rent if they decided to leave for Pakistan. He finally succeeds in finding a smaller house to rent, but his business is failing and despite his son's exhorting, refuses to change with the times, believing that Allah would protect them. Salim Mirza's passiveness and disconnection from the outside world leaves his wife and son frustrated. The Mirza family house is bought by a close business associate, Ajmani, (A.K. Hangal) who respects Mirza and tries to help him. Despite growing troubles, the family is briefly buoyed by Sikander's graduation from college. Amina and her family have almost given up on her marrying Kazim after Halim breaks his promise to return soon from Pakistan. Kazim sneaks across the border and returns on his own, and reveals that his father had become opposed to his marrying Amina, preferring that he marry the daughter of a Pakistani politician. Having received a scholarship from the Government of Pakistan to study in Canada, Kazim desires to marry Amina before he leaves, but before the marriage can take place, he is arrested by police and repatriated to Pakistan for travelling without a passport and not registering at the police station, as is required of all citizens of Pakistan. Amina is heart-broken, and finally accepts Shamshad's courtship. Sikander undergoes a long string of unsuccessful job interviews, where the interviewers repeatedly suggest that he would have better luck in Pakistan. Sikander and his group of friends become disillusioned and start an agitation against unemployment and discrimination, but Salim prohibits Sikander from taking part. Despite his political connections, Salim Mirza's brother-in-law ends up in debt over shady business practices and decides to flee to Pakistan. Amina again faces the prospect of losing her lover, but Shamshad promises to return and not leave her like Kazim. Salim Mirza's reluctance to modernise and cultivate ties with the newly formed shoemakers union results in his business not receiving patronage and consequently failing. Disillusioned, his son Baqar decides to migrate to Pakistan with his son and wife. Salim's aged mother suffers a stroke, and through his friend, Salim is able to bring his mother to her beloved house for a final visit, where she dies. While Salim is travelling in a horse-drawn carriage, the carriage driver, a Muslim, gets into an accident and a squabble with other locals. The situation deteriorates into a riot, and Salim is hit by a stone and suffers injuries. With his business and elder son gone, Salim begins to work as a humble shoemaker to make a living. Shamshad's mother returns from Pakistan for a visit, leading Amina and her mother to think that Shamshad would also come soon and their marriage would take place. However, Shamshad's mother merely takes advantage of Salim Mirza's connections to release some of her husband's money, and reveals that Shamshad's marriage has been arranged with the daughter of a well-connected Pakistani family. Shattered with this second betrayal, Amina commits suicide, which devastates the whole family. Amidst these problems, Salim Mirza is investigated by the police on charges of espionage over his sending of plans of their former property to his brother in Karachi, Pakistan. Although acquitted by the court, Mirza is shunned in public and faces a humiliating whisper campaign. Mirza's long aversion to leaving India finally breaks down and he decides in anger to leave for Pakistan. Sikander opposes the idea, arguing that they should not run away from India, but fight against the odds for the betterment of the whole nation, but Salim is called a spy for Pakistan and decides to leave anyway. However, as the family is travelling towards the railway station, they encounter a large crowd of protesters marching against unemployment and discrimination, which Sikander had planned to join. Sikander's friends call out to him, and Salim encourages him to join the protesters. He instructs the carriage driver to take his wife back to their house, and the film ends as Salim Mirza himself joins the protest, ending his isolation from the new reality.",

    "Synopsis": "In an unnamed forest in seemingly ancient Japan, a woman named Himiko conducts rituals as the shaman and prophetess of the Sun God in the ruling kingdom of the Sun God people. Other tribes in the region are the Land People, worshippers of the ground, water, and animals, and the Mountain People, an unsightly group of mute wanderers conjoined by a rope. A lone traveler named Takehiko appears from the far side of the mountain and enters the forest. Himiko spends her days weaving cloth on a loom and is pleased to hear of Takehiko's arrival. In a ritual, the king of the Sun God People, Ohkimi, discusses the visions seen by Himiko and the possibility of Mimaki succeeding the throne. Nashime, servant to Himiko, believes that Himiko will be the successor, as direct orders from the Sun God. Mimaki confides in his brother Ikume and King Ohkimi that he believes Himiko may be losing her ability to communicate with the Sun God due to her love for Takehiko, that the Land God and the Mountain God are false Gods, and that they should take over the other kingdoms and force them to believe in only the Sun God. Takehiko meets Himiko in her quarters after dark, revealing that he is her half-brother. Despite this, she seduces him and they have sex while Adahime, one of the ritual assistants, watches from a distance. The next night, Himiko addresses the court subjects and states that the Sun God requires the people of the kingdom to accept the Land God and the Mountain God as valid Gods. King Ohkimi accuses her of having lost her prophetic powers, but Nashime assassinates the king while the subjects are all distracted by Himiko's speech. She takes over as queen and orders anyone who did not believe in the Sun God's words to be buried alive in the mountains. Takehiko is resistant to stay with Himiko and continue their incestuous relationship, and he leaves the kingdom. Adahime follows him and professes her love for him, pleading him to have sex with her. He obliges, and Himiko is horrified and orders his arrest. Takehiko is captured and brought back to Himiko, who orders him to be tortured and banished. The Mountain God People carry him up the mountain where Adahime reunites with him. Back in the Sun God Kingdom, Nashime consoles a broken Himiko, and she performs oral sex on him. Meanwhile, Mimaki and Ikume conspire to take power away from Himiko. Nashime keeps her locked away in her room and Mimaki takes the throne as king. Nashime then tells Mimaki that the young girl Toyo will take Himiko's place as the shaman and prophet of the Sun God. Mimaki declares war on the Land and Mountain God People. Takehiko and Adahime run away from the kingdom, but they are ambushed and killed by Mimaki's soldiers. Their corpses are shown to Himiko, who is devastated. Nashime concedes that Himiko has gone mad with love, so he frees the imprisoned Mountain God People, who torture and kill her. Overwhelmed with guilt, Nashime cries out for her in the mountains. Mimaki kills Ikume in a sword battle on a ridge. The new prophetess, Toyo, declares the Sun God is still within Himiko and that the powerful country of Wei is to be given many slaves and offerings, which disturbs Mimaki and upsets Nashime. Years later, Nashime is walking in the forest, still wracked with guilt and grief over Himiko's death, when he looks up and sees a helicopter. The camera pans out to reveal that the forest is atop a kofun, an ancient keyhole-shaped burial mound, surrounded by a suburban neighborhood with offices, houses, factories and a highway. The credits roll with aerial shots of more ancient tumuli and their modern surroundings across Japan.",

    "Synopsis": "The story follows young Huck Finn and his friend, Jim, an escaped enslaved man. Huck once lived with his father, a vagrant and drunkard who soon abandoned him. Authorities then placed Huck with the kind widow Douglas, who taught him good manners and provided him with a stable life. However, Huck's father returns to town, demanding $300 for his son, and, upon being refused, kidnaps Huck and locks him in a shack by the Mississippi River, hoping for ransom. Huck secretly cuts an escape route through the wall and plans to flee. His father, upon learning that neither the widow nor anyone else intends to pay, returns from town and, in a drunken rage, mistakes Huck for a death angel and tries to stab him, forcing Huck to sleep with a rifle for protection. Fearing for his life, Huck escapes, staging his own murder to avoid pursuit. On the opposite bank of the Mississippi, he meets Jim, who has also run away from the widow. Together, they build a raft and set off for Cairo, where Jim hopes to gain freedom and buy his family's freedom. However, they accidentally pass Cairo, and Huck, conflicted over helping an enslaved person escape, briefly abandons Jim but ultimately apologizes, reuniting with him. Their journey takes a twist when two conmen—one a self-styled amateur actor and dandy claiming to be the Duke of Bridgewater, and the other a swindler calling himself Louis XVII, the \"son\" of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette—join them on the raft. When they stop in a town, the Duke stages Shakespearean plays in local theaters, amusing crowds before escaping with their money. In the next town, the King learns about the recent death of a preacher, Peter Wilks, whose daughters stand to inherit a fortune. If Wilks' English brothers, Harvey and the mute William, arrive, they would claim part of the inheritance. The King and the Duke pose as the brothers, with Huck as their servant. Discovering their scam to steal from orphans, Huck hides the stolen money in Peter’s coffin. However, the real Harvey and William arrive, and Huck and Jim try to escape, though the King and Duke catch up. Eventually, Huck buys tickets to Cairo to finally part ways with the conmen, but the King sells Jim for drink money. Huck devises a plan to rescue Jim, even as the townspeople cover the conmen in tar and feathers and chase them away. Compassionate despite their deception, Huck and Jim let the weeping frauds back on their raft. Huck’s final resolve is to help Jim achieve freedom, no matter the cost.",

    "film_title": "Mahler (film)",
    "Synopsis": "The opening credits begin with a little hut on a pier on an idyllic lake exploding in flames; then a cocooned woman struggles to break free of her white wrappings in an outdoor setting near a rough rock carving of Mahler’s head. The structure of the film is that Mahler and his wife Alma have returned to Europe from his time conducting in the United States, and are on the train to Vienna. People are thronging the platforms to greet him at each station, but he makes Alma draw the blinds and will not listen to the people's speeches or receive their bouquets. Instead, various incidents on the train trigger his memories or visions, and we see them. Alma’s lover Max is also on the train, urging her to leave Mahler and get off with him a couple of stops before Vienna. The idyllic hut on the pier is seen in the first flashback: Mahler is trying to compose in it, and he gets Alma to go around the whole lake hushing the animals and people who are making noise. She succeeds at this by persuasion and giving out beer. A woman who agrees to change compartments with the couple comments that Mahler’s newly composed Ninth Symphony is all about death; this upsets him, as does someone else’s dictum that after Beethoven no composer can ever write more than nine symphonies. He has a heart attack and a doctor on the train tends and revives him, but he has a vision of being alive in a windowed coffin while Alma and Max ignore his pleas, carry on with each other and cremate him. Other flashbacks include a visit to the Emperor of Austria Franz Josef about a music director job. Franz Josef is far too young for the early 1900s, when the movie is set, and makes more and more outrageous demands on Mahler, ending by making him expose the physical evidence that he is Jewish and rejecting him on those grounds. It turns out this is not the real Emperor but Mahler's friend Hugo Wolf, who thinks he is the Emperor, and the locale is the asylum. In another episode, Alma wants to compose music too and Mahler's lead singer sings her song, but Mahler tells her her job is wife and mother and composition is too stressful, citing their mad friend and Mahler's brother, whose lack of success at it led to his mental breakdown and suicide. Alma sadly buries her song in the woods and mourns over it. Mahler's conversion to Catholicism is expressed by a fantasy sequence in which he undergoes a baptism of fire and blood on a mountaintop, presided over by Cosima Wagner, whose influence as Richard Wagner's widow means her anti-Semitism is a powerful force in the music world. She is depicted goose-stepping around in black-lipped makeup, wearing a Prussian helmet and a bathing suit with a cross on the front and a swastika on the rear. In a final flashback, Alma is very upset and attacks him in the hut on the pier because he wrote the song cycle Songs on the Death of Children (Kindertotenlieder). This is conflated with the actual death of one of his children, but that really happened years later. The doctor on the train who tended him tells him he is in perfect health. Mahler tells Alma she has the choice of getting off before Vienna with Max at his stop or staying with him. She wants to know if he has ever put her before his music; he says all his music is about and for her, that she is his music. He tells her that the 2nd theme of his Sixth Symphony is her. They kiss, and Max gets off without her. Mahler is then cheerful enough to show himself at the train window and accept the bouquets from fans. They arrive at Vienna, where the doctor reports to Mahler's regular doctor by phone; the latter reveals that Mahler is very ill and only has a week or two to live. The train doctor meets the happy couple as they walk through the station and starts to tell Mahler the true state of his health; but Mahler says he does not need to hear it because he and Alma are going to live forever.",

    "film_title": "Stavisky",
    "Synopsis": "The core narrative of the film portrays the last months in the life of Serge Alexandre (Stavisky), from late 1933 to January 1934. We see glimpses of his operations as a \"financial consultant\", setting up a mysterious company to deal in international bonds, his 'laundering' of stolen jewellery, and his juggling of funds to stave off the discovery of fraudulent bonds that he has sold through the Crédit Municipal in Bayonne (municipal pawnbrokers); we see his activity as a theatre impresario in Paris, his casino gambling, his purchase of influence among the press, the police, and politicians, and always his extravagant lifestyle and desire to impress; we see his devotion to his glamorous wife Arlette, his exploitation of her beauty to lure funds from a Spanish revolutionary fascist, his contradictory accounts to his friends of events in his own past, and gleams of political idealism - which may yet be just expedients to create further webs of deception. Interposed in the narrative are moments of flashback (to his teenage awakening to a hedonistic life, to his arrest as the petty crook Stavisky in 1926, and to his father's suicide after this family dishonour) and flash-forwards (to his funeral, and to the parliamentary enquiry into the Stavisky affair at which his friends and associates testify with varying degrees of honesty). Also punctuating the main story are scenes depicting the arrival of Trotsky in France to seek political asylum, and his sojourn in various country houses and hotels, receiving visits from left-wing activists. These scenes appear to have no link with the main narrative (apart from two minor characters: the young German-Jewish actress who moves between both stories, and the police-inspector who monitors Trotsky's movements and then also investigates Alexandre), until the end of the film when, in the wake of Stavisky's fall and exposure as a Ukrainian immigrant, a Jew, and a confidant of members of the left-of-centre government, Trotsky's presence is deemed undesirable and he is expelled from the country, while a new 'government of national unity' is formed. The death of Alexandre/Stavisky in a chalet in Chamonix becomes a further mystery: either a suicide by gunshot, like that of his father, or an assassination by the security forces to ensure his silence.",

    "Synopsis": "The film opens with brief flashes of a man and a woman embracing. The man later proves to be Brady, the \"odd-job man.\" There is also a flash of the woman's body floating in the lake. The reclusive Helen invites her friend Anne, a writer, to stay the weekend with her at her family's estate. The large manor, located near a lake in a forest, is overgrown with foliage and has mostly been untouched for an extended period of time. Helen, a translator, has recently returned to her native England after working abroad, and had lost touch with Anne. Helen had broken up with her boyfriend John. The two women have dinner, start a fire in the hearth, during a storm, and talk over tea before going to bed. Helen asks Anne what she thinks happens after death. The next morning, Helen stops by a chemist store in town, where the clerk, Mr. Burke, asks about her friend, Cora Porter; she tells him she is not with her. Back at the manor, Helen and Anne go for a walk through the woods. At the lake, Helen tells Anne that someone drowned themselves there. The two women take a boat out onto the water, which unnerves Helen. En route home, they encounter Brady, a handyman who lives in the stables on the property; Anne comments that he was staring at Helen, and Helen responds by saying he disgusts her. Later, Helen spies on him with binoculars from the house. Helen continues to have trouble sleeping at the house, and hears voices emanating from the attic one night. The following morning, Anne borrows Helen's car to drive to town. On the way home, she stops by the lake and smokes a cigarette, where she is confronted by Brady, who introduces himself. He mentions Helen's friend Cora, whose photograph Anne recalls seeing in the house. Anne returns to the house where she finds Helen distraught over her absence. She confides in Anne that she is ill, and Anne suggests they return to London, but Helen refuses, and then kisses her. That night, Anne is awoken by moaning noises. She asks Helen if someone else could be living in the house, but Helen dismisses the idea. John arrives at the house to pick up Anne, but Anne insists on staying a few days longer due to Helen's fragile emotional state. Helen observes John kissing Anne in the car, and is upset. That night, Helen's attention is drawn to an attic door in her bedroom, and she begins to masturbate furiously. Anne gets up to investigate the noises she hears and is startled by a figure who stabs her to death. Hannah, the housekeeper, arrives in the morning, and finds Helen asleep on the couch; Helen asks her not to return for several days, saying she needs solitude. Later at the drugstore, Hannah tells Mr. Burke about the interaction, and recalls that she once saw Cora having sex with Brady in the stables, and has not seen her since. While walking through the woods, Helen is confronted by Brady, who asks her about Anne's whereabouts; when he intimates that she murdered Anne and Cora, Helen runs away in a panic. At the house, Anne's dead body sits in a chair in Helen's bedroom, and Helen is plagued by disembodied voices and other phenomena. During a rainstorm, John arrives looking for Anne, and enters though an unlocked door. Upstairs, Helen stabs him in the head and neck numerous times, killing him. That night Brady stops by Helen's house to confront her about Cora, whose decomposing body he has found in the lake. He has cut off some off Cora's hair and brought it with him to show Helen. He tells Helen he witnessed her push Cora in, but she coolly denies it. When he threatens to blackmail her, she stabs him repeatedly in the face and the back of the head, killing him. She appears to see flashes of Cora standing in an open doorway, illuminated by flashes of lightning during another rainstorm. The next morning, Hannah, Burke, and his protege Nick arrive at the house. In the living room, they find Brady's corpse. While searching upstairs, they find John's body in the hallway, and Helen staring blankly through the window. In the yard, she watches as Brady and Cora embrace.",

    "Synopsis": "\nLuis, an unmarried, middle-aged, Barcelona businessman, carries out his mother's dying wish to be buried in the family crypt in Segovia. He has her bones exhumed from a pantheon in Barcelona and heads by car to the Castilian city. In the middle of a lonely road, he stops and gets out of the car, recalling the same landscape at a moment in his childhood when he was being brought up to spend part of his summer vacation with his maternal grandmother in Segovia during the fateful summer of 1936. He sees his parents before him, trying to soothe him after a bout of carsickness. Just days before they were to pick him up, a military uprising cut Segovia off from the Republican part of Spain and Luis found himself trapped in the menacing environment of his mother's Nationalist relatives for the duration of the war.\n\nAfter this first remembrance of his carsickness, Luis continues his journey. Arriving in Segovia, he makes contact with his aunt Pilar and his cousin Angélica, his sweetheart during his Segovian captivity. Angélica is now married to Anselmo, a successful businessman, and has a daughter of her own, also named Angélica, who is just about the age her mother was when she and Luis were sweethearts. The reunion rekindles old memories for Luis.\n\nIn these remembrances, the past is not merely evoked, but reenacted with Luis literally entering a time warp. Characters Luis has met in the present appear to him playing the role of relatives he remembers thirty-six years earlier. The child Angélica of 1973, plays the role of her own mother, Luis's cousin Angelica, as he thinks he remembers her from 1936; Anselmo is imagined as Angélica's fascist father. When Luis recalls scenes from his childhood, he walks into them as the middle-aged man he is.\n\nLuis and Angélica meet in the attic, where they discover Luis's old elementary school books and have a kiss in the rooftop, rekindling briefly their closeness. Reading his old school books, he remembers when he was during the war in a religious school in which a little boy is killed by shards of flying glass. The older Luis sits in his schoolroom listening to a priest tell a horror story about a little student, killed in an air raid, who may or may not be eternally damned depending on whether or not the boy had \"given in to temptation\" the morning he was killed. After his evocation of the school bombing, Luis has an emotional encounter with his cousin Angélica in which she speaks to him of her failed marriage. She intimates a reawakening of the affection she once had for Luis. However, this reinforces Luis's determination to leave Segovia finally. After saying goodbye to his adult relatives, he goes for a bike ride with Angélica's daughter, which triggers his memory of his thwarted escape with his cousin through Nationalist lines in an effort to rejoin his parents. They were promptly stopped by Falangist soldiers and forcedly returned to his uncle's house to be punished. His uncle whips him with a belt. In the next room, Angélica's mother is combing her hair; a tear rolls down one of her cheeks.\n",

    "Synopsis": "Harry Caul, a surveillance expert in San Francisco, specializes in audio recordings. He and his team are hired by a client known as \"the Director\" to eavesdrop on a couple, whom they record walking in circles in Union Square. Despite the background noise, Harry filters and merges the tapes to create a clear recording with ambiguous meaning. Harry is intensely private, obsessively guarding his personal life; though he insists that he is not responsible for how his clients use the surveillance he creates, he is haunted by guilt from a past job that resulted in three deaths. He meets with Martin Stett (Ford) who meets with Harry instead of the Director, who told Harry to give the tapes only to him. When Harry attempts to retake the tapes, Stett wrests them away and warns him about the contents of the tape. When he discovers a potentially dangerous phrase in the recording, \"He'd kill us if he got the chance,\" Harry becomes increasingly anxious. His attempt to deliver the recording is thwarted, and he is both followed and threatened. After a party at his workshop, Harry spends the night with a woman he has just met and the tapes are stolen. He receives a call from Martin Stett, the Director's assistant, informing him that the Director could not wait any longer and they have the tapes. Harry is tasked with delivering the pictures taken and collecting his money in a meeting with the Director that afternoon. There he learns that the woman in the recording is the Director's wife, involved in an affair. Harry, suspecting murder, books a hotel room next to the one the couple had mentioned for a planned rendezvous in the recording, and overhears a heated argument. Convinced there was a murder, Harry breaks into the room; he initially finds no evidence, until he flushes the toilet and finds it clogged and overflowing with blood. Attempting to confront the Director, Harry discovers the wife is alive and unharmed, as is her lover. A newspaper headline reports that an executive has supposedly died in a car accident. Harry realizes that the couple actually murdered the Director, having missed the emphasis on the word \"us\" in the recording, which not only expressed the couple's fear of being killed by the Director if he discovered the affair, but was also an attempt to justify killing him first as a defensive move. Stett calls Harry at his apartment, and warns him not to investigate. He plays a freshly made recording of Harry playing his saxophone to prove they are listening. Harry frantically searches for bugs in his apartment, destroying nearly everything in it. Having failed to locate the bug, Harry sits alone amid the wreckage, playing his saxophone.",

    "film_title": "The Last Detail",
    "Synopsis": "In Norfolk, Virginia, Navy lifers Signalman First Class Billy \"Badass\" Buddusky and Gunner's Mate First Class Richard \"Mule\" Mulhall are assigned a shore patrol detail escorting 18-year-old seaman Larry Meadows to Portsmouth Naval Prison near Kittery, Maine. Meadows has been court-martialed, dishonorably discharged, and has received a harsh sentence of eight years in the brig for attempting to steal $40 from a charity donation box, which happened to be run by the wife of the Norfolk Naval Base Commander. Badass and Mule are given one week to escort Meadows to the Portsmouth brig. Despite their initial resentment of the detail, they soon come to like the young sailor, who is timid, naive, and resigned to his fate. They also discover that Meadows is a kleptomaniac. Believing that Meadows received an unjust sentence, Badass and Mule decide to make his journey to the brig as pleasant as possible; the pair make several stops along their route to provide bon-voyage adventures for the young man. The trio's activities include bar-hopping, brawling with Marines, and other misadventures. They stay overnight at a hotel, drinking beer and watching TV after missing their train. Badass teaches Meadows some flag semaphore signals and tries to get the young prisoner to stick up for himself by provoking him into a fight, but is unsuccessful. The following morning, they take a detour to Camden, New Jersey to visit Meadows's mother, but she is not home. Meadows is embarrassed and ashamed after the three enter the house and find it unkempt with several empty liquor bottles lying around. In New York City, the men encounter a group of chanting Nichiren Buddhists who teach Meadows how to pray. One of the Buddhists invites the three to a house party, where she offers to help Meadows flee his imprisonment and find refuge in Canada. Meadows declines, reasoning he does not want to cause trouble for his \"best friends\". Badass tries to seduce a woman at the party by talking about the romance of the sea, but she shows little interest. Mule makes awkward conversation about serving in the Navy with the liberal party guests. In Boston, Badass and Mule take Meadows to a brothel so he can lose his virginity. When alone with a young prostitute, Meadows immediately ejaculates, but Mule and Badass pay for Meadows to have a second chance. While they wait, Badass and Mule make conversation about their lives outside of the Navy. Badass reveals a previous marriage dissolved because his wife wanted him to be a TV repairman. Mule has not married and is still supporting his mother. The next morning, Meadows tells the two men that despite the young prostitute's profession, he thinks she may have developed romantic feelings for him. Just as they are about to leave for Portsmouth, Meadows suggests they go on a picnic. The senior sailors buy some hot dogs and attempt an uncomfortable barbecue in the snow at a local park, where Badass confides in Mule about his concern for Meadows and the potential abuse that he will face in prison. Meadows suddenly attempts to run away, in a last-ditch effort to escape but he falls down and is caught by the two men, who subdue and pummel him. Badass, Mule and Meadows finally arrive at the prison; before they can say goodbye, Meadows is immediately marched off to be processed. The young duty officer, a Marine first lieutenant wearing an Annapolis ring, notices Meadows's injuries and berates Badass and Mule. The sailors are asked if Meadows tried to resist or fight, which they deny. The officer continues to give them a difficult time and points out that their orders were never signed by the master-at-arms in Norfolk, and claiming that as far the Navy is concerned, the orders are still in Norfolk. The officer says the pair are in deep trouble but relents when they demand to speak to his boss, the Executive Officer. On the way out, Badass admonishes the officer for forgetting to keep his copy of the paperwork. With the detail complete, the pair stride away from the prison complaining about the officer's incompetence. Both hope their orders will have come through by the time they arrive back in Norfolk.",

    "film_title": "The Nickel Ride",
    "Synopsis": "<!--per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words--> In Los Angeles, Cooper is a \"key-man\" (fence) for a local crime boss, operating a series of warehouses used as storage facilities for stolen and illicit goods. Cooper hopes to close a deal for a new block of storage units, bribing local realtor Elias O'Neil to broker a deal with city officials to sell him the warehouses. Elias tells Cooper that he needs more time, so Cooper gives him a week with an implicit threat of violent retaliation should he fail. Cooper is ordered by his boss Carl to fix a boxing match, after their resident fixer Paulie failed to get the fighters to take a dive. Carl meets with Paulie, who tells the former that he's lost his touch and wants out of the criminal underworld. Cooper volunteers to fix the fight on his behalf, and informs the boxer Tonozzi that if he doesn't take a dive, Paulie will be hurt. Tonozzi reluctantly agrees. After a surprise birthday party, Cooper is taken by Carl and his bodyguard Bobby to one of the prospective warehouses, where he is ordered to finish the deal by Saturday. Carl introduces Cooper to Turner, a young punk dressed like a cowboy who is to be his protege in the underworld. A disgruntled Cooper returns to his birthday party, but is interrupted by Paulie's arrival, announcing Tonozzi won the fight. Begging Cooper to help him, Paulie is advised to leave town until Cooper can smooth things over with Carl. Cooper visits Elias at a barbershop to close the warehouse deal, but Elias demands another $15,000 for bribes. Cooper agrees to pay out another $10,000, but Elias questions his authority to do so as he heard rumors that Cooper is on the way out. Cooper meets Carl and gives him the weekly pay offs. As he gets in the elevator to leave, Bobby joins him and brags that he killed Paulie. Angered, he brutally beats Bobby and breaks two of his ribs in the process. Cooper is driven to Carl's office by Turner, who is now Carl's driver following Bobby's hospitalization. At the office, Turner goes to the bathroom, allowing Cooper to slide a gun from his desk and hide it under his coat. Turner returns and asks questions about Cooper's days as a carnival barker, but Cooper does not answer and goes outside just as Carl drives up. Carl authorizes the extra $10,000 for the warehouse, but warns Cooper that he better have a \"yes\" by Saturday. He chastises Cooper for beating Bobby, stating that Cooper is the syndicate's \"computer\" and they cannot afford for him to break down. Hoping to relax, Cooper and his girlfriend travel to a cabin in the woods. Things seem fine, until Sarah notices wet footprints inside the cabin and Cooper discovers his gun missing from a drawer. After searching the cabin and finding no one, Cooper buys new locks and a shotgun. That afternoon, Cooper drives to Elias's hotel, only to find he is not registered there. He telephones Elias, but gets no answer. Returning to the cabin, Cooper finds Turner waiting for the warehouse answer. Cooper responds that when he gets the answer, he will call Carl himself, and sends Turner away. After Turner leaves, Sarah demands to know what is going on, but Cooper will only say it is \"business.\" Enraged, Sarah slaps Cooper, who then punches her in the face. Embarrassed, Cooper puts her on the bed, explaining that there are new people that want to take his job away, and without his work he is nothing. As there is no telephone in the cabin, Cooper goes to a nearby bait shop and calls the hotel. Upon learning Elias never arrived, Cooper drives back to the cabin and falls asleep holding his shotgun. He dreams Turner is there, holding a rifle; Cooper aims his shotgun, causing Turner to drop the rifle, and scream that he only wants the \"message.\" Cooper slugs him with the gun and, just as he is about to pull the trigger, Sarah appears, distracting Cooper long enough for Turner to grab the rifle and shoot Sarah. Cooper awakens and tells Sarah they have to return to the city. After dropping Sarah off, Cooper goes to Elias' house and learns that the deal has fallen through and that Carl already knows. Cooper puts Sarah on a train for Las Vegas, promising to join her later. He then finds Carl at a restaurant and threatens to kill him if he doesn't take the contract off his head. Carl insists that the mob cannot lose their \"key man\" and that they will find other warehouses. At his home, Cooper is attacked by Turner with a gun. Cooper is shot multiple times, but manages to charge Turner, then beats him and strangles him to death. He collapses to the floor in exhaustion, and dies of his wounds.",

    "film_title": "The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat",
    "Synopsis": "In the 1970s, Fritz has graduated from college and is now married, on unemployment benefits, and has a son named Ralphie, who often masturbates. As his wife, Gabrielle, berates him for his irresponsibility, Fritz smokes cannabis and imagines himself in different lives. In the first life he meets his Puerto Rican friend Juan the camel and they discuss Juan's sister Chita. At Juan's house, Chita complains about the odor of Fritz's cannabis, but is persuaded into smoking it. The drug sends Chita into arousal and the pair have sex. Meanwhile, a pair of crows intending to rob the house change their minds and watch the pair. The sex is interrupted by the arrival of Chita's father, who shoots Fritz dead. The violent scene turns off the two crows who decide to come back another time. In his second life, Fritz meets a drunken bum claiming to be God. In his third life, Fritz is a soldier in Nazi Germany. After being caught having a ménage à trois with a commanding officer's wife and daughter, Fritz escapes and winds up being an orderly to Adolf Hitler. Fritz takes the form of a therapist, and analyzes Hitler, telling him that his world domination plans were just a way of trying to get attention. In the showers, Hitler \"accidentally\" drops his soap, and urges Fritz to pick it up, in an attempt to rape him, and ends up getting his single testicle blown off. Fritz is killed by an American tanker. In his fourth life, Fritz attempts to sell a used condom to a liquor store owner, Niki. As the pair chat, Niki learns that his wife caught gonorrhoea from Fritz, angering him. Leaving the store, Fritz tells a passerby that he was an irresistible stud in the 1930s. Fritz's fifth life is a psychedelic montage of old stock film and animation, vaguely illustrating Fritz's downfall in the 1930's (losing everything to excessive partying and drinking). In his sixth life, Fritz tries to cash a welfare check with Morris, a Jewish toad who owns a pawn shop. Fritz offers Morris a deal: if Morris cashes Fritz's welfare check, then Fritz will give Morris a toilet seat. Morris initially refuses, but a sudden onset of diarrhea from the pickles he had been eating pushes him to accept the deal. Instead of cashing Fritz's welfare check, he gives Fritz a space helmet. Fritz envisions himself as a NASA astronaut in his seventh life, and prepares for the first mission to Mars. During an interview with journalists, Fritz invites a crow reporter into the space shuttle to have sex. The shuttle takes off earlier than planned, and it explodes in space. In Fritz's eighth life, he sees the ghost of his dead friend, Duke. In the future, Henry Kissinger (who is represented a rat) has become the president and grants independence to New Jersey, which is renamed \"New Africa\". Fritz works as a courier and must deliver a letter to the president of New Africa. In New Africa's \"Black House\", the vice president assassinates the president and frames Fritz for the deed. A war breaks out between America and New Africa, Kissinger declares an unconditional surrender, and Fritz is executed. In his final life, Fritz finds himself living in the sewers of New York, where he meets an Indian guru and Lucifer himself (who is represented as a purple cat with wings, horns, and a devil-like tail). However, Gabrielle snaps Fritz out from his drug-induced reality, who finally throws him out of the apartment room to get him to improve their family for her. After a quick look at all of his lives, Fritz declares this life to be the worst and then leaves to make up for his irresponsibility as a father and husband.",

    "Synopsis": "Lou Jean Poplin visits her incarcerated husband, Clovis Michael Poplin, to tell him that their son will soon be placed in the care of foster parents. Even though he is four months away from being released from prison, she convinces him to escape to assist her in retrieving their child. They hitch a ride from the prison with a couple, but when Texas Department of Public Safety Patrolman Maxwell Slide stops the car, they take the car and run. When the car crashes, the two felons overpower and kidnap Slide, holding him hostage at the head of a slow-moving and growing caravan, initially of police cars but eventually including news vans, private citizens' vehicles, and helicopters. The Poplins and Slide travel through Beaumont, Dayton, Houston, Cleveland, Conroe, and finally Wheelock, Texas. By holding Slide hostage, the pair are able to continually gas up their car, as well as obtaining food and supplies, some of which are provided by locals. During the lengthy pursuit, Slide and the pair bond and develop mutual respect for one another. The trio attempts to commandeer an RV from a used car lot, but local vigilantes try to inflict justice on the Poplins. They make contact with Captain Tanner, who allows them to depart after further bargaining with Clovis. The Poplins make it to Sugarland, Captain Tanner attempts to have Clovis turn himself in and he refuses. Slide and then Clovis recognize that something is amiss at the home of the foster parents, but Lou Jean insists that Clovis retrieve their son. A pair of Texas Rangers shoot and fatally wound Clovis, and after another car chase, the Texas Department of Public Safety arrests Lou Jean. Patrolman Slide is found unharmed. An epilogue preceding the closing credits explains that Lou Jean subsequently spent fifteen months of a five-year prison term in a women's correctional facility. Upon getting out, she obtained the right to live with her son, convincing authorities that she was able to do so.",

    "Synopsis": "Bowie, a young man convicted of murder when a teenager, and Chicamaw, an old lag, escape from a Mississippi prison in 1936 and join up with another old lag, T-Dub, who has hired a cab to meet them. They hide out with an acquaintance, who owns a garage and set to work robbing banks. Here Bowie gets to talk to Keechie, the garageman's daughter. They next hole up with T-Dub's sister-in-law Mattie and her children, including her older daughter Lula, the object of T-Dub's lascivious attention. Bowie is injured in a car crash, after which Chicamaw guns down an inquisitive officer. He leaves Bowie at the garage, where Keechie takes care of him. They become lovers but Bowie has no intention of turning his back on crime. Bowie leaves to meet up with the others and they rob a bank but the trigger-happy Chicamaw shoots and kills a bank clerk. The robbers split up and Bowie returns to a distraught Keechie. We learn that T-Dub has been killed and Chicamaw recaptured and returned to prison. After persuading an unwilling Mattie to let the pregnant Keechie stay in a cabin at her motel, Bowie, posing as a sheriff, springs Chickamaw from prison but the latter, while claiming to have merely tied the warden to a tree, has instead shot him dead. Bowie forces Chicamaw out of the car and leaves him at the side of the road to fend for himself. Returning to the motel cabin he is ambushed by Rangers, who blast the cabin with gunfire, watched by an anguished Keechie, forcibly restrained by Mattie, who has betrayed Bowie. Bowie's bloody corpse is carried out and laid on the mud. In the final scene we see Keechie at the station, ready to take the first train out to find a place where she can have her baby. (In Anderson's novel, she too is killed by the Rangers.)",

    "Synopsis": "In a remote mountain village in Ming China, Gu Sheng-zhai is a well-meaning but unambitious scholar and painter, with a tendency towards being clumsy and ineffectual. A stranger, Ouyang Nian, arrives in town and agrees to have his portrait painted by Gu, but his real objective is to bring a female fugitive back to the city for execution on behalf of the East Chamber guards. The fugitive, Yang Hui-zhen, is befriended by Gu, and together they plot against the corrupt Eunuch Wei who wants to eradicate all trace of her family after her father's attempt to warn the Emperor of the Eunuch's corruption. His daughter fled, with generals Shi and Lu. The saintly and powerful Chan Buddhist Abbot Hui Yuan intervenes to protect them, and they spend two years at his monastery where he teaches them self defence. Ouyang, Yang and her friends are all superior warriors. Ouyang has a special flexible sword that bends and that he can wear within his belt, making him seem unarmed. Gu has sex with Yang. Upon doing so, he is no longer the naïve bumbling innocent, but instead becomes confident and assertive, and when Yang's plight is revealed, he insists on being part of it – and even comes up with a fiendish \"Ghost Trap\" for the East Chamber guards. Ouyang is killed in a fight in a bamboo forest, and they use his signature seal to lure the East Chamber guards into the trap. This is a plan to use a supposedly haunted site to play tricks on the guards to make them believe they are prey to the undead. General Lu dies in the \"Ghost Trap\" battle. In the aftermath, Gu walks through the carnage laughing at the ingenuity of his plan until the true cost of human life dawns upon him. He sees Abbot Hui and his followers arrive to help bury the dead. After the battle, Gu is unable to find Yang, who he is told has left him and does not want him to follow her. He tracks her down at the monastery of Abbot Hui, where she has given birth to a child by Gu and become a nun. She tells Gu that their destiny together has ended and gives Gu their child. Later, when Gu and the child are tracked down by Xu Xian-Chen, the evil commander of Eunuch Wei's army, Yang and General Shi come to Gu's rescue. Abbot Hui and four of his monks also arrive to fight Xu. After Xu fakes repentance in order to surprise attack Abbot Hui, a battle begins in which Xu is killed and Yang, Shi, and Abbot Hui are all badly injured (the latter bleeding golden blood). The film ends with the injured Yang staggering toward a silhouetted figure, presumably Abbot Hui, seen meditating with the setting sun forming a halo around his head, an image suggesting the Buddha and enlightenment.",

A former singer, Alice sells most of her belongings, intending to take her son, Tommy, to her childhood home of Monterey, California, where she hopes to pursue the singing career she abandoned when she married Donald. Their financial situation forces them to take temporary lodgings in Phoenix, Arizona, where she finds work as a lounge singer. She meets Ben, a younger, seemingly unmarried man who charms her into a sexual relationship that comes to a sudden end when his wife, Rita, confronts Alice. Ben breaks into Alice's apartment while Rita is there and physically assaults Rita in front of Alice. He also threatens Alice and smashes up her apartment.

    "film_title": "Chronicle of the Years of Fire",
    "Synopsis": "The film is set between the late 1930s and 1954 and is structured in six chapters, each representing a phase in Algeria's path toward revolution. It follows Ahmed, a peasant farmer, as he becomes swept up in the nationalist movement. Through his story and the lives of other Algerian villagers, the film illustrates the harsh realities of colonialism and the growing consciousness that leads to revolt. The film opens with a portrayal of the daily life of an impoverished Algerian village. Drought and famine ravage the region, leaving the people in a state of desperation. The villagers, like Ahmed, live in abject poverty and are exploited by French colonial authorities who impose harsh taxes and force them to labor under unbearable conditions. The drought symbolizes the desolation of their lives, as natural resources are scarce and life becomes a constant struggle for survival. French rule continues to tighten its grip, and the people are trapped in a system that offers them no hope of improvement. As World War II rages, Algeria, though far from the European battlefields, feels the effects of the conflict. France's colonial administrators continue to exploit the local population while Algerians are conscripted into the French army to fight in a war that is not their own. The colonial authorities promise reforms after the war, fueling false hope among the people. Amidst this, Ahmed begins to develop a political consciousness, sensing that the promises made by France are empty and that true freedom must come from the people themselves. The war ends, but the French authorities fail to deliver the reforms they had promised to the Algerian people. Instead, the colonial regime becomes more repressive, further alienating the local population. Ahmed witnesses the first sparks of resistance as nationalist movements start to form. The end of the war brings no relief, only deeper frustration as the French brutally suppress any signs of dissent. The film portrays this time as a period of growing tension, with the people increasingly aware of the need for organized resistance. Anti-colonial sentiments reach a breaking point. The nationalist movements gain momentum, and Ahmed becomes involved in clandestine efforts to organize resistance against the French. The villagers begin to talk more openly about revolution, despite the risks. A pivotal moment occurs when French forces massacre protesters, igniting widespread outrage. This massacre acts as a catalyst for the Algerians, who now realize that armed struggle is the only path to freedom. Ahmed’s transformation from passive peasant to active revolutionary takes shape during this time. The years of resistance grow more intense as the French military responds to the increasing rebellion with brutal force. The film shows the rise of guerrilla warfare tactics used by the Algerian fighters, emphasizing the disparity in resources between the colonizers and the colonized. Ahmed and the villagers continue their resistance efforts, suffering heavy losses but gaining inspiration from their growing resolve. Despite the violence and death surrounding them, the people find strength in their unity and shared goal of independence. Ahmed, now a committed fighter, plays a key role in organizing the local population into a resistance force. The film concludes with the eruption of the Algerian War of Independence. By this point, the entire country is in revolt, and Ahmed is fully entrenched in the struggle. The villagers, once isolated and disconnected, have become part of a nationwide movement. The war officially begins with a coordinated uprising on November 1, 1954, known as \"Toussaint Rouge\" (Red All Saints' Day), marking the beginning of Algeria’s fight for independence from French rule. The final scenes show the flame of resistance spreading, symbolizing the indomitable spirit of the Algerian people and their hope for liberation. While victory is far from certain, the film ends on a hopeful note, suggesting that the future belongs to the Algerians who have risen up to claim their freedom.",

Electra is therefore filled with the urge to kill him and his supporters in revenge. To humiliate her, Aegisthus forces her to marry a dwarf. Her brother, Orestes, then returns from abroad, disguised as a messenger reporting his own death. Electra kills him but he comes back to life. Electra and Orestes join with the people to depose Aegisthus. They capture him in a net, torture him, and have him shot. A red helicopter lands: the siblings climb into it and fly off. The unexpected intrusion of twentieth century technology highlights the extent to which timeless political themes from a two thousand year old Greek myth resonate for an audience in contemporary Hungary.",

    "film_title": "Man Friday (film)",
    "Synopsis": "Friday and four of his friends arrive in a canoe on the island on which Crusoe has been stranded for years. When they start to consume a deceased comrade in a reverent form of ritual cannibalism, Crusoe kills Friday's friends and takes the latter to his camp as a prisoner. Friday is very quick to learn the English language. Crusoe then tries to teach him Western concepts like property, sports, punishment, fear of God and so on, but Friday's reaction is only one of bewilderment and amusement. He begins to question and mock these concepts that seem senseless and destructive to him. One day he rebels, refusing to be a slave anymore. After some conflict, Crusoe has to admit that he could not live in solitude anymore, so he concedes in regarding Friday as a human being, although not as an equal. To do so, he starts to pay Friday one gold coin per day for his labour—an ambivalent sign of respect, as there is no use for money on the remote island. When an English ship appears, Crusoe is overjoyed. Two men arrive in a boat and are invited for dinner but it turns out that they are slave traders who want to capture both Crusoe and Friday. So the latter collaborate in killing the intruders when their violent motives are revealed, and the ship sails away, leaving the protagonists stranded as before. For a while, a kind of friendship develops between Crusoe and Friday. Friday thinks that he maybe can teach Crusoe his more relaxed way of living, and not to be controlled by \"thoughts of power, guilt and fear\", which are very strong traits in Crusoe's personality. One day, Crusoe falls back into his old delusions of being a superior being. He had been trying to teach Friday in a mock-up school for a while, ridiculously complete with a chalkboard. We see that the topic of the day, written on the chalkboard, is \"civilization\". Obviously, for Crusoe this is a culmination point, where his concepts are ultimately confronted with those of Friday. He gets in a frenzy and binds Friday to a pole, then holds a frightful, lunatic sermon about the superiority of his ways while threatening Friday with his gun. In the end, he shoots, but not at Friday, but at his own talking parrot, which had been his sole companion before Friday's arrival. After that shocking experience, Friday gives up his attempts to change Crusoe; the friendship also ends, leaving only the relationship of Crusoe as master and Friday as a paid servant. After several years, Friday has accumulated 2,000 gold coins, the price that Crusoe once mockingly called for the hut and all his belongings. Friday now turns Crusoe's western ways against him. Catching him by surprise, he throws the gold on a table, declaring himself the owner of the material property; swiftly, he takes control of baffled Crusoe's gun, and coldly declares that the master-servant-relationship is inverted now. He forces Crusoe to build a solid raft, and both men put to sea for Friday's home island. When they have arrived there, Friday tells the story of their relationship to the gathered tribe, which reacts with astonishment and amusement about the strange ways of Crusoe. When the latter requests to join the tribe, proposing that he could teach the children, Friday strongly speaks against him, saying that \"the only thing he (Crusoe) teaches is fear.\" So Crusoe is rejected and returns to his solitary island, where he commits suicide.",

The Act overrode fundamental rights and privileges enumerated in common law and in the Canadian Bill of Rights. This measure enabled the arbitrary arrest of more than 450 people, against whom no charges were ever laid. Some were held as many as 21 days. The film tells the story of five of incarcerated civilians. The film is scripted, but is inspired by interviews with actual prisoners held during the events.

One day, in 1828, the same man takes Hauser out of his cell, teaches him a few phrases, and how to walk, before leaving him in the town of Nuremberg. Hauser becomes the subject of much curiosity, and is exhibited in a circus before being rescued by Professor Georg Friedrich Daumer, who patiently attempts to transform him. Hauser soon learns to read and write, and develops unorthodox approaches to logic and religion; but music is what pleases him most. He attracts the attention of academics, clergy and nobility. He is then physically attacked by the same unknown man who brought him to Nuremberg. The attack leaves him unconscious with a bleeding head. He recovers, but is again mysteriously attacked; this time, stabbed in the chest. Hauser rests in bed describing visions he has had of nomadic Berbers in the Sahara, and then dies. An autopsy reveals an enlarged liver and cerebellum.",

    "Synopsis": "David Locke is a disaffected television journalist in northern Chad, looking to interview rebel fighters who are involved in the civil war. Struggling to find interviewees, he is further frustrated when his Land Rover gets stuck in a sand dune after being abandoned there by guides. After a long walk through the Sahara back to his hotel, an exhausted Locke discovers that a fellow guest (Robertson), an Englishman with whom he had struck up a casual friendship, died in his room of a heart attack that same night. Locke decides to switch identities with Robertson, whom he greatly resembled, and reports his own death at the front desk, the plan going off without a hitch. Locke collects Robertson's belongings, which include a pistol, an appointment book and passport. He alters the passport to carry his own photo. In London, Locke's unfaithful wife Rachel becomes guilt-ridden when she learns of her husband's \"death\". She approaches his friend, a BBC producer named Knight<!-- Martin -->, to track down Robertson and learn about Locke's purported last days. Locke, having flown to Munich, finds an airport locker which contains a folder with a price-list and several photocopied pages illustrating armaments. Acting on a whim, he follows a white horse and carriage to a wedding in a baroque chapel, where he waits at the back of the congregation. Once the wedding finishes, two men who observed Locke at the airport confront him and ask for \"the papers\". After Locke hands them the papers from the locker, they give him an envelope of money and tell him that the second half is to be paid in Barcelona. It becomes apparent that Robertson was an arms dealer for the same rebels whom Locke had been trying to contact in Chad. In Barcelona, Locke spots Knight<!-- Martin -->, who is trying to find Robertson. Locke encounters an architecture student, credited only as 'Girl', while trying to hide in a Gaudi building, the Palau Güell. Later (at La Pedrera, another Gaudi building on Paseo de Gracia), Locke asks the girl to fetch his belongings from the hotel so that he will not be seen there by Knight<!-- Martin -->, who is watching the lobby. Knight<!-- Martin --> overhears her while she collects her baggage, and speaks to her outside. She offers to take him to meet Robertson, suggesting he follow her in a taxi, but she manages to lose him. She and Locke leave Barcelona, becoming lovers while on the run. Flush with cash from the down payment on undelivered arms, Locke is drawn to keep a meeting scheduled in Robertson's diary. His contact does not show up; the men arranging the arms deal are abducted, interrogated, and beaten by hitmen operating for the Chadian government. In London, Rachel receives Locke's belongings from Africa. Having heard from Knight<!-- Martin --> of his unsuccessful chase in Barcelona, Rachel is shocked as she opens Locke's passport to find Robertson's photo pasted inside. Suspecting the truth, she heads to Spain to find Locke, as the hitmen follow her, thinking they are after Robertson. Rachel gets help from the Spanish police in her pursuit, but Locke and the girl continue to elude them. With their getaway car damaged, Locke sends the girl away, instructing her to meet him three days later in Tangiers. Virtually trapped, Locke checks into a hotel in the Spanish town of Osuna, where he finds that the girl has returned and booked a double room posing as Mrs. Robertson. He again tries to persuade her to leave. She exits the hotel and dawdles around the dusty square outside, wanting to return to him. Soon the hitmen arrive at the hotel, departing just before the police arrive with Rachel. The girl joins the latter group, who find Locke dead in his room. Asked by the police whether they recognize him, Rachel says that she never knew him, but the girl says, \"Yes\".",

    "film_title": "They Fought for Their Country",
    "Synopsis": "The film takes place in July 1942. After suffering severe losses in battle, a Soviet rifle regiment retreats to Stalingrad. During a rest stop on the Don steppe, one of the regiment's soldiers, Pyotr Lopakhin , goes to a nearby village to get salt salt and a bucket for freshly caught crayfish. Relying on his conversationalism and charm, Lopakhin approaches an older Cossack woman, but is met with disdain as the soldiers retreat, leaving the locals to fend for themselves. After a difficult conversation, it is revealed that, despite his outward jovialness, he is deeply worried about the fate of the country, and the old woman fulfills his request. Interrupting the cooking of their crayfish, an order arrives from command directing the regiment to occupy and hold the hill in the middle of the steppe. Digging trenches in the rocky ground, the regiment's men establish positions and repel the first tank attack with grenades and anti-tank rifles. Before the second wave, German aircraft bomb the regiment's positions, killing many soldiers, and Private Nikolai Streltsov, Lopakhin's friend, suffers a severe concussion. The second German tank attack nearly breaks through the regiment, but the arriving Soviet reinforcements drive the German forces back. The regiment marches through a burning wheat field at night. Private Ivan Zvyagintsev, a former combine operator, is horrified by the extent of the damage caused by the war. Having reached the next farmstead, the soldiers prepare for battle, and Lopakhin, flirting with a local woman, manages to obtain two jugs of cold milk for his unit. In the next battle, using a PTRD, he shoots down a German Junkers Ju 87 attack aircraft, which explodes upon crashing into a hill. Later, after some time in another place, the regiment again engages in battle with enemy tanks. The tanks crush the positions of the defenders: the young corporal Kochetygov died setting a German tank on fire with a Molotov cocktail. The remaining Soviet soldiers launch a counterattack, during which Private Zvyagintsev is severely wounded by artillery shrapnel. The Germans are forced into retreat, and a young nurse pulls Zvyagintsev from the battlefield. After having buried the last officer in the regiment, the regiment moves on again. During their break, Private Nekrasov amuses the soldiers with a story about how he accidentally startled an old woman at night who thought that he was trying to pester her. In the field hospital, Zvyagintsev is operated on without anesthesia as the surgeon extracts numerous fragments from his legs and back. The remnants of the regiment are stationed in yet another village, but there have run out of food and the locals refuse to feed the retreating soldiers. Lopakhin attempts to charm a local villager, Natalya, and helps her with her with farmwork. That night, Lopakhin tries to seduce her, but she hits him in the eye in the dark. The next morning, Lopakhin finds a table full of food and concludes that his plan was a success after all. Natalya bitterly tells him that she has a husband who is now in the hospital and that she only prepared the food for them because the regiment sergeant had told the local kolkhoz chairman that they had recently prevailed in a fierce battle. Natalya adds that the locals are ready to give everything they have, if only the soldiers would protect them. The regiment is withdrawn to the rear for rest and reinforcements. Lopakhin spots his old friend, Nikolai Streltsov, in the crowd. It turns out that he had escaped from the field hospital, and, despite being completely deaf and suffering from a concussion, has rejoined his comrades. A recently arrived colonel heartily thanks the fighters and kisses the banner of the regiment, which has been diligently guarded throughout the film. Large forces of Soviet troops continue moving toward Stalingrad.",

    "Synopsis": "The story revolves around Felice Pietà, a man of modest means who resides with his second wife, Adelaide. Together, they raise Monica, Felice's daughter from his first wife, Silvia, who took her own life years ago under mysterious circumstances. Haunted by Silvia's absence, Felice decides to visit the place where she ended her life one final time. To his astonishment, Silvia reappears and reveals that she faked her suicide because she grew weary of living in poverty with Felice in Venice. Silvia discloses her intention to return since she missed her life with him. Consequently, Felice leaves Adelaide to embark on a new chapter with his beloved Silvia. Silvia departs for London to address matters with her current husband, and Felice suggests taking their daughter along. However, Silvia departs without actually returning. After a few months, Felice discovers their whereabouts and tracks them down in Milan, where Silvia's affluent husband emphasizes her desire to maintain the luxurious lifestyle she has become accustomed to while also seeking custody of Monica, despite the legal complexities. In this context, Felice, adopting a detached and market-driven approach, suggests selling Monica based on her weight. Silvia's husband attempts to negotiate the weight and eventually pays 45 million for the child. During the train journey back to Venice, Felice encounters a woman who bears an uncanny resemblance to Silvia. The silent exchange between them occurs through voiceovers. Felice responds to the woman's promise of eternal love and happiness by expressing his disbelief in love, understanding her true motives as merely an attempt to take away his money.",

    "Synopsis": "The film begins in 1937, with seven year old Paul being dropped off by his parents at a religious boarding school, in the middle of the night on the eve of World War II. Several years later, after his mother gets a divorce from his father, during the Nazi occupation of France, Paul, who is now thirteen years old, returns to live with his cold–hearted mother, who doesn't even like him. Feeling abandoned and emotionally cut off from his mother and sister, he is constantly skipping school and wanders the streets of Paris, seeking out relationships with grown men, often playing an errand boy for the German soldiers, who reward him with cigarettes and small gifts. In one scene during the German occupation, Paul is seen comforting a naked woman, shaved bald, with a big swastika painted on her breasts, as she is marched through the streets and humiliated by the crowd during an anti-collaborationist purge. Once the Liberation of France starts, he gets involved in the activities of the French Resistance. And then he gravitates to the friendly American soldiers who take him under their wing, offering both companionship and sexual encounters, with a steady supply of chocolate and cigarettes. After the war, Paul continues to befriend, and have sexual relations with men who are older than him, until he finally decides to make a career for himself as an actor. The film ends with a stranger asking for a light from a smoking Paul in the street, as he is about to embark on becoming an extra in Marcel Carné's Les Enfants du Paradis. In an uncredited cameo, the stranger is the director of the film, Gérard Blain. The depictions seen in the film are exactly what Blain actually did after being abandoned by his father as a kid, leaving school at age thirteen, and soon embarking on relationships with older men while harboring acting aspirations.",

    "film_title": "Bugsy Malone",
    "Synopsis": "During the prohibition era, a mobster named Roxy Robinson is \"splurged\" by members of a rival gang, using rapid-fire cream-shooting \"splurge guns\". Once splurged, a gangster is \"all washed up... finished\". Mob boss Fat Sam Staccetto introduces himself in the opening narration, as well as introducing Bugsy Malone, a penniless boxing promoter who is 'a little too popular with the broads... but a nice guy' (\"Bugsy Malone\"). At Fat Sam's Grand Slam Speakeasy, there is much dancing and singing (\"Fat Sam's Grand Slam\"). Fat Sam rants about the loss of Roxy, who was one of his best men, laying the blame on up-and-coming rival mob boss Dandy Dan and worried that Dan is trying to take control of his criminal empire. Blousey Brown, an aspiring singer and actress, has come for an audition at the speakeasy, but Sam is too distracted to see her. Bugsy meets Blousey when he trips over her luggage; he is instantly smitten and attempts to flirt with her. Just then, Fat Sam's is raided by Dandy Dan's men, who shoot up the place. Over the next few weeks, Dan's men continue to attack Fat Sam's empire, eventually taking over all of Sam's moneymaking rackets (including the sarsaparilla racket and lettuce racket) and splurging members of Fat Sam's gang until only the speakeasy remains. Sam finds his gang fooling around (\"Bad Guys\") and then sends all his available men except his personal enforcer Knuckles, to see if they can track down the guns but they are ambushed at a laundry and splurged by Dandy Dan's gang. Bugsy returns to Fat Sam's to arrange a new audition for Blousey. Fat Sam's girlfriend, the chanteuse Tallulah, makes a pass at him and, although Bugsy rejects her flirtation, Tallulah plants a big kiss on Bugsy's forehead just as Blousey enters. Blousey is jealous but performs anyway, using her personal feelings to boost her performance (\"I'm Feelin' Fine\"). Fat Sam hires Blousey after her audition and she leaves quickly, refusing to speak to Bugsy. Sam hires Bugsy as a driver to accompany him to a truce meeting with Dandy Dan. He also takes along \"Looney\" Bergonzi, a top Chicago mob enforcer. The meeting is a trap, but Bugsy helps Fat Sam escape and is paid $200 by a grateful Sam. Bugsy and Blousey reconcile and have a romantic outing on a lake, where Bugsy promises to take her to Hollywood. When he returns Sam's car to the garage he is attacked and his money is stolen. Bugsy is saved by Leroy Smith, who assaults the attackers and drives them away. Bugsy realizes that Leroy has the potential to be a great boxer and introduces him to boxing coach Cagey Joe (\"So You Wanna Be a Boxer?\"). Fat Sam seeks Bugsy's aid again after Knuckles is accidentally splurged to death by a malfunctioning splurge gun knockoff. Bugsy resists but Fat Sam offers him $400, enough money to keep his promise to Blousey, although she is disappointed when she learns that Bugsy hasn't bought the tickets to California yet (\"Ordinary Fool\"). Bugsy and Leroy follow Dandy Dan's men to a warehouse where the guns are being stashed. They realize the two of them can't take the place alone, so Bugsy recruits a large group of down-and-out workers at a soup kitchen (\"Down and Out\"). They successfully assault the warehouse and take the crates of guns. Taking refuge at Fat Sam's Speakeasy, Bugsy and his army disguise themselves as waiters and patrons and await Dan's arrival. Chaos ensues as a massive splurge gun fight erupts and unarmed patrons throw cream pies, covering everyone (except Bugsy and Blousey), but somehow no one gets \"finished\" this time. Razamataz the piano player is hit from behind and falls onto the keys, striking a single bass chord. The tone silences the room, and the cream-covered crowd realize they can all be friends. They perform the final number (\"Bad Guys Reprise\" / \"You Give a Little Love\") as Bugsy and Blousey leave for Hollywood.",

    "Synopsis": "The events of the film are set mainly in 1975, but interweave the past, present and future. Eight-year-old Ana overhears her father, Anselmo, in bed with a woman, followed by choking sounds. The woman rushes out alone and leaves. Ana finds her father dead in bed, apparently from a heart attack. Calmly, Ana removes a half-full glass of milk from the dresser, carries it to the kitchen, and washes it. Ana's mother, María, enters the kitchen and chides her for being up so late. It is revealed shortly that Ana is imagining her mother, who previously died of cancer. At Anselmo's wake, Ana again sees the woman who fled the bedroom - Amelia, who is married to Nicolás, a longtime army compatriot of Anselmo's. (It is mentioned later that the two men had served in División Azul, volunteering to fight alongside the Nazis in World War II.) Although Ana views her father's body, she refuses to kiss his forehead when prompted by the adults. Upon returning home from the wake, Ana goes into the basement and retrieves a tin containing a white powder. The camera pans to an adult Ana, who looks exactly like María and begins to address the camera. She explains that her mother had once told her the powder was a potent poison, and that after her mother's death, she came to the conclusion that her father's cruelty had caused the cancer, so she used the powder to kill her father. Ana, who is on summer vacation from school, lives in a large, quiet house with her young sisters, Irene and Maite; her grandmother, who is mute and a wheelchair user; Roni, a pet guinea pig; and Rosa, the vivacious family maid and Ana's closest companion. Following the funeral, María's sister Paulina becomes the orphaned children's guardian and moves in. Flashbacks reveal that María was a warm and imaginative mother; in contrast, Paulina is stern and patronizing. Ana rebels against her aunt's authoritarianism while routinely reliving memories of life with her mother and imagining her presence. Many of the memories are distressing, including witnessing María writhing in pain in her final days. In another, Ana watches her parents argue late at night. María begs Anselmo to be more present in his family's life, saying that she is sick and wants to die; Anselmo dismisses her coldly, countering that she is trying to manipulate him into ending his infidelities by feigning illness. Growing increasingly despondent, present-day Ana offers to help her grandmother die by administering the same poison powder she used to kill her father, which her grandmother accepts, but then declines once Ana tells her that the \"poison\" is called baking soda. Later, Ana discovers Roni dying and strokes him until he goes still. Nicolás comes to the house to visit Paulina, who is revealed to be his mistress. Ana, holding a pistol she found in her father's study, walks in on an intimate moment between the two adults. Nicolás eventually persuades her to hand him the gun, and discovers that it was loaded. That night, Ana attempts to kill Paulina by dissolving the \"poison\" in a glass of milk, which she later retrieves and washes as she did her father's glass. Ana then enters Paulina's bedroom and strokes her hair as she lies asleep in bed. Ana is briefly shocked that Paulina is alive the next morning. At breakfast, Irene recounts a dream from the night before: two men kidnapped her and couldn't reach María and Anselmo for ransom, but when they were about to kill her, she woke up. The sisters leave for school, emerging from their cloistered lives into the vibrant, noisy city, captured in a long tracking shot that contrasts with the tighter framing of the preceding scenes.",

    "Synopsis": "The film tells the story of a large Apulian family living in an extremely poor shantytown of the periphery of Rome. The protagonist is one-eyed patriarch Giacinto (Manfredi). Four generations of his sons and relatives are cramped together in his shack, managing to get by mainly on thieving and whoring, among other things more or less respectable. For the loss of his eye, an insurance company has paid Giacinto a large sum. Giacinto refuses to share his money with anyone, and spends little of it on himself, preferring to hide it from his family, which he routinely abuses verbally and physically. Various members of the family unsuccessfully try to steal his money. When Giacinto falls in love with an obese prostitute, brings her home and starts spending his money on her, Giacinto's enraged wife conspires with the rest of the family to poison him. However, Giacinto survives. In a frenzy of anger, he sets fire to his home. To his disappointment, his family survives. Giacinto then sells the house to a Neapolitan immigrant family. Giacinto's family refuses to let the Neapolitans take over the shack, and in the ensuing fight, the shack collapses. The film ends with Giacinto living in a newly built exceedingly crowded shack with both his mistress and his wife, together with an apparently reconciled family and the newcomers as well.",

Bruno allows Robert to ride with him while his clothes dry, rarely speaking while Bruno drives along the Western side of the East German border in a repair truck, servicing equipment at worn-out movie theaters. While out on the road, Bruno and Robert encounter several people in various states of despair, including a man whose wife has committed suicide by driving her car into a tree. Robert also drops in on his elderly father to berate him for disrespecting Robert's mother. After Bruno and Robert have a minor brawl after a conversation about Robert and his wife, Robert finally leaves Bruno, though Bruno later spots him riding a train. Bruno continues his service calls to theatres, including one that no longer screens films because the owner regards modern films as exploitative.",

    "Synopsis": "Paris, January 1942. France is occupied by the Germans. Robert Klein, apparently apolitical and amoral, is a well-to-do art dealer, Roman Catholic and Alsatian by birth, who takes advantage of French Jews who need to sell artworks to raise cash to leave the country. One day, the local Jewish newspaper, addressed to him, is delivered to his home. He learns that another Robert Klein who has been living in Paris, a Jew sought by police, has had his own mail forwarded to him in an apparent attempt to destroy his social reputation and make him a target of official anti-Semitism. He reports this to the police, who remain suspicious he may be reporting this scheme to disguise his own true identity. His own investigations lead him in contradictory directions, to Klein who lives in a slum while having an affair with his concierge and to Klein who visits a palatial country estate where he has seduced an apparently Jewish married woman. When the art dealer cannot locate the other Klein, authorities require him to offer proof of his French non-Jewish ancestry. While waiting for the documentation to arrive, he struggles to track down his namesake and learn his motivation, even breaking off an opportunity to flee the country in order to investigate further. Before he can resolve the situation by either means, he is caught up in the July 1942 roundup of Parisian Jews. As he is hustled into a dark tunnel, his lawyer arrives with complete proof of his non-Jewish ancestry. Klein blankly ignores the lawyer's pleas and continues into the tunnel. The film offers no clear resolution of its contradictory evidence and dead ends. It ends as he is reunited with Jews who once were his clients as they board boxcars for Auschwitz.",

The shy and quiet Vishwam is married to Rukmani while his brothers Anjaiya and Prasad make it a practice to demand the services of any village woman they fancy. The village gets a new schoolmaster, who arrives in the village with a wife, Sushila, and a son. When Vishwam sees Sushila for the first time, he is unable to take his eyes off her and unable to get her out of his mind. Sushila does not reciprocate his feelings. One night, while the schoolmaster is enjoying a quiet dinner with his family, someone knocks on the door and, when Shushila goes to answer the door, Anjaiya and Prasad take her away forcibly. Several people are present, but no one dares to raise a hand or voice to stop this abduction. At the jagirdar's house, Sushila is raped regularly and repeatedly at the will of the jagirdar and his brothers. The distraught schoolteacher, who is denied justice by everyone from the local police officer to the district collector, is helped by the old pujari of the village temple.

    "Synopsis": "Vurrla, also known as Dandy, is a car thief. As a public defender tries in vain to understand her, the only thing driving the young woman is to steal enough automobiles to make enough money to buy a Ferrari Dino, her dream car. After being arrested, Vurrla fools her court-appointed lawyer, Le Clerq, into vouching for her character. He later learns that she's been arrested more than once, skips court appearances and is wanted by the law. Le Clerq is irresistibly fascinated by her, even after she abuses his trust and even makes him an unwitting accomplice in a shoplifting. Using a scheme that involves various disguises, dialects and phony stories, Vurrla cons a number of innocent people by selling stolen vehicles to each, getting paid in cash. She betrays former boyfriend Andy in the process, causing him to be jailed and lash out at her. She also ends up costing childhood friend Edmund, another thief, his life during a police pursuit when his car plunges off a street ramp. Finally unable to cajole her way out of trouble, Vurrla takes possession of her coveted Ferrari, goes for one fast ride in it, then sets it on fire. Presumably ready to surrender to authorities, she is asked by Le Clerq, her lawyer, \"Was that absolutely necessary?\"",

    "film_title": "Taxi Driver",
    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for film articles should be 400-700 words. -->In New York City, Vietnam War veteran Travis Bickle takes a job as a night-shift taxi driver to cope with his chronic insomnia and loneliness, frequently visiting adult movie theaters and keeping a diary in which he consciously attempts to include aphorisms such as \"you're only as healthy as you feel\". He becomes disgusted with the crime and urban decay that he witnesses in the city and dreams about getting \"the scum off the streets\". Travis becomes infatuated with Betsy, a campaign worker for Senator and presidential candidate Charles Palantine. Travis enters the campaign office where she works and asks her to join him for coffee, to which she agrees. Betsy agrees to go on a second date with him, during which he takes her to an adult movie theater, which she leaves immediately. He attempts to reconcile with her, but fails. Enraged, he storms into the campaign office where she works and berates her before being kicked out of the office. Experiencing an existential crisis and seeing various acts of prostitution throughout the city, Travis confides in a fellow taxi driver, nicknamed Wizard, about his violent thoughts. However, Wizard dismisses them and assures him that he will be fine. To find an outlet for his rage, Travis follows an intense physical training regimen. He gets in contact with black market gun dealer Easy Andy and buys four handguns. At home, Travis practices drawing his weapons, going as far as creating a quick-draw firearm hidden in his sleeve. He begins attending Palantine's rallies to scope out his security. One night, Travis shoots a man attempting to rob a convenience store run by his friend, leaving before the cops arrive as the convenience store owner proceeds to beat the non responsive robber. In his trips around the city, Travis regularly encounters Iris, a 12-year-old child prostitute. Tricking her pimp and abusive lover Sport into thinking that he wants to solicit her, Travis meets with her in private and tries to persuade her to stop prostituting herself. Travis shaves his hair into a mohawk and attends a public rally where he plans to assassinate Palantine. However, Secret Service agents see Travis putting his hand inside his jacket and approach him, which escalates to a chase. Travis escapes pursuit and makes it home undetected. That evening, Travis drives to the brothel where Iris works to kill Sport. He enters the building and shoots Sport and one of Iris's clients, a mafioso. Travis is shot several times but manages to kill the two men. He fights with the bouncer, whom he manages to stab through the hand with his knife and kill with a gunshot to the head. Travis attempts to die by suicide, but has no bullets. Severely injured, he slumps on a couch next to a sobbing Iris. As police respond to the scene, a delirious Travis mimics shooting himself in the head with his bloody finger. Travis goes into a coma due to his injuries, but he is hailed by the press as a heroic vigilante and not prosecuted for the murders. He receives a letter from Iris's parents in Pittsburgh, who thank him and reveal that she is safe and attending school. After recovering, Travis returns to work, where he encounters Betsy as a fare. Betsy tells him that she followed his story in the newspapers. Travis drops her at her home but declines to take her money, driving off with a smile. He becomes agitated after noticing something in his rearview mirror, but continues driving into the night.",

    "Synopsis": "After 40 years of hard work, the widower Gregorio decides to sell the bakery business he has built up. He has no confidence in any of his three children, who all hate each other: Pippo is decent but weak, Mario is a gambler and womaniser, while the shrewish Teta is married to a pompous government employee. He therefore announces that none of them will inherit. Pippo marries the sweet and quiet Irene and ineffectually tries to run the ironmongery business of her old parents. She sets out to reconcile the three siblings with each other and with their obstinate old father. She wins over Mario, becoming his secret mistress, and even gains grudging co-operation from the abrasive Teta by their common interest in advancing themselves, not only financially but also socially to escape their origins as petty tradespeople. Irene next tackles the curmudgeonly Gregorio. She decides to take care of him and his house, looking after his diet and his health, and ends up in his bed. Happy at last, after many lonely years, he tells her he has changed his will to make her the sole heir and dies. Irene summons the family round to tell them what has happened. Pippo is lost in alcohol, Teta reacts with fury, but Mario is more deeply hurt and shoots himself. When Teta challenges the will in court, the decision is that the surviving children must share the inheritance.",

    "film_title": "The Marquise of O (film)",
    "Synopsis": "The story begins in a tavern in a northern Italian town in the early 19th century, where two men are reading an announcement in the paper by the Marquise of O, a widow, that she is pregnant and wishes the father of her child to present himself in order to marry him. The men are shocked by this announcement because she comes from an excellent family and her father, the Colonel, is in charge of the citadel. The next scene shows the Marquise's father's citadel being overrun by Russian forces during the Napoleonic Wars. In the confusion, the Marquise finds herself about to be raped by a group of soldiers. However, she is saved by the commander of the attack, the Count, who reunites her with her daughters and has her put to bed. Her maid orders poppy seed tea for her to help her sleep. The Count then finishes the attack on the Italians and the Marquise's father, the colonel, has to surrender. When the Marquise awakes, she wants to thank the Count for having saved her, but the troops have left. Her father reassures her that she will have the chance to thank him at a later date. They receive news that the Count has died during a battle because of a chest wound. This upsets the Marquise, who never got a chance to thank her rescuer. She starts to feel strangely and collapses. She has no explanation for this but figures that it is due to her traumatic attack, although it reminds her of being pregnant. The reports of the Count's death turn out to be false, as he appears at the family's house and asks for the Marquise's hand in marriage. They do not immediately give him an answer because the Marquise had previously resolved to not be remarried after the death of her husband and the family agrees that the couple hardly know each other. The Count is very insistent on her giving an answer immediately because he is supposed to be leaving to take a post in Naples. He decides to stay at their home much to the chagrin of the Colonel who does not think he should desert his post in Naples in order to win the hand of his daughter. He dines with the family and tells them his reasons for wanting to marry the Marquise, mainly being that he hallucinated visions of her while he was recovering from his chest wound. After dinner, the Marquise admits to her parents that this is a great test to her gratitude because, although she does not wish to be remarried, she feels that she owes him this favour in return for having saved her. She decides to agree to marry him, which pleases her mother greatly. They tell the Count and tell him to go to his post in Naples and return when it is a better time to be married. They promise that the Marquise will not entertain any other suitors as potential husband. He is very happy about this and departs. While he is away, the Marquise finds herself to be appearing more and more pregnant, but does not believe it to be possible since she has not been with any man since her husband died three years before. Her pregnancy is confirmed by a doctor and then a midwife. This infuriates her parents, who do not believe her innocence. They send her a letter telling her that she is no longer welcome in her home because of the shame she would bring the family. They also attempt to have her leave her daughters with them, but she refuses and takes them to her deceased husband's estate, which is somewhat secluded. The Count returns and is told that the Marquise is pregnant. He is still insistent on marrying her, which shocks her brother. He then goes to the estate where she is staying and attempts to enter but is turned away by the porter who is on strict orders to not let in any guests. So he sneaks in through the garden and finds the Marquise sitting outside with her daughters. He begs her to accept his marriage proposal but she does not and runs away. She then decides to publish the announcement in the newspaper. The announcement is answered the very next day by an anonymous person who says that he will present himself at her father's house on the 3rd at eleven o'clock. Upon seeing the reply, the Marquise's parents believe that she is playing a trick on them and remain unconvinced of her innocence. So her mother decides to put this to the test by telling her that it is their servant, Leopoldo, and then gauging her reaction. She makes her way to the Marquise's residence and is accepted by her daughter. She then tells her daughter that the man has already come forward to them and that it is Leopoldo. The Marquise is upset because he is of a much lower class than she is but she accepts it and agrees that she will marry him. This convinces her mother that she is indeed innocent because she really did not know who the father is and did not have someone in mind to appear on the 3rd. Her mother then confesses that she had played a trick on her to determine her innocence and they make up. She takes the Marquise back to the family home to explain to the Colonel that she is indeed innocent and then leaves them alone for him to apologize. When her mother returns, the Marquise is sitting in her father's lap embracing him and kissing him, which pleases her mother, who is glad they are again on good terms. They then discuss the possibility of the Marquise having to marry a man of a lower class, but she is not very concerned by this and agrees to marry whoever appears on the 3rd. When the fateful day arrives, the Marquise and her mother wait in their parlour room for the father to appear, and he does, but it is none other than the Count. He confesses to having taken advantage of her during the night of her rescue. The Marquise is upset by this revelation because she trusted him and now considers him to be a monster. But her mother is pleased by this because she considers him to be a suitable husband for her since he is of good standing and well off. They come to an agreement involving her father that they shall be married but the Count will have none of the benefits but all of the duties of a husband. The next day they are unhappily married and shortly thereafter the Count gets an apartment in town but does not visit the family until after the birth of the child. Eventually the Marquise develops respect for the Count again and in the last scene of the film they are seen kissing happily.",

    "film_title": "The Tenant (1976 film)",
    "Synopsis": "Trelkovsky, a quiet and unassuming man, rents an apartment in Paris whose previous tenant, Egyptologist Simone Choule, attempted suicide by throwing herself out of the window and through a pane of glass below. Before moving in officially, he meets the concierge, who shows him the apartment and the spot where Simone fell. Nobody knows the reason for the suicide attempt. Trelkovsky visits Simone in the hospital but finds her entirely in bandages and unable to talk. Whilst still at Simone's bedside, Trelkovsky meets her friend, Stella, who has also come to visit. Stella is overwhelmed with emotion and begins talking to Simone, who looks towards her visitors and screams monstrously. The matron insists they leave, having already informed Trelkovsky that he may not speak to Simone. Trelkovsky tries to comfort Stella but dares not say that he never knew Simone, instead pretending to be another friend. They leave together and go out for a drink and a movie, where they fondle each other. Outside the theatre, they part ways. Later, Trelkovsky calls up the hospital to enquire about Simone and is told she has died. As Trelkovsky occupies the apartment, he is chastised repeatedly by his neighbors and landlord, Monsieur Zy, for hosting a party with his friends, apparently having a woman over, making too much noise in general and not joining in on a petition against another neighbor. Trelkovsky attempts to adapt to his situation but is increasingly disturbed by the apartment and the other tenants. He frequently sees his neighbors standing motionless in the toilet room (which he can see from his own window) and discovers a hole in the wall with a human tooth stashed inside. He discusses this with his friends, who do not find things strange and belittle him for not standing up to his neighbours. He visits the apartment of one of his work friends, who plays a marching band record at a spitefully loud volume. A neighbour politely asks him to turn down the music, as his wife is ill and trying to sleep. Trelkovsky turns the record down, but his friend tells the neighbour that he will play his music as he wants, and that he does not care about his sick wife. Trelkovsky receives a visit from one Georges Badar, who secretly loved Simone and has believed her to be alive and well. Trelkovsky updates and comforts the man and spends the night out with him. He receives a postcard that Badar had posted before realising Simone had died. Frequenting the nearby café which Simone also patronised, he is recognized as the new tenant of her apartment. The owner pressures him into having Simone's regular order, which is then always given to him without being ordered, against his preferences. They are always out of his preferred choice of cigarette, Gauloises, so he develops a habit of ordering Marlboros, which Simone used to order. Trelkovsky becomes severely agitated and enraged when his apartment is robbed, while his neighbors and the concierge continue to berate him for making too much noise; Zy warns him not to inform the police of the burglary. Suffering from fever and bad dreams, Trelkovsky wakes up one morning to find his face made up. He buys a wig and women's shoes and goes on to dress up (using Simone's dress, which he had found in a cupboard) and the viewer realizes that no one is standing still in the opposite bathroom in front of his window. The next morning, he realizes that one of his front teeth is missing and finds it in another hole in his apartment. He suspects that Zy and the neighbors are trying to subtly change him into the last tenant, Simone, so that he too will kill himself. He becomes hostile in his day-to-day environment, and his mental state progressively deteriorates. He has visions of his neighbors playing football with a human head; finding the toilet covered in hieroglyphs; and looking across the courtyard, seeing himself standing at his apartment window, looking into the bathroom with binoculars. He runs off to Stella for comfort and sleeps over, but in the morning after she has left for work, he concludes that she too is in on his neighbors' plot and proceeds to vandalise and burgle her apartment before departing. At night, Trelkovsky is hit by an elderly couple driving a car, but he is not seriously injured. The responding doctor, who believes Trelkovsky's odd behavior is caused by delirium tremens, gives him a sedative injection. Trelkovsky perceives the elderly couple as Zy and wife, accusing them of trying to murder him. The couple returns him to his apartment. A deranged Trelkovsky dresses up again as a woman and throws himself out of the window in the manner of Simone, before what he believes to be a clapping, cheering audience composed of his neighbors. The suicide attempt wakes up his neighbors, who call the police and attempt to restrain him. He crawls away from them back to his apartment and jumps out the window a second time moments after the police arrive. In the final scene, Trelkovsky is bandaged up in the same fashion as Simone, in the same hospital bed. From his perspective, his and Stella's visit to Simone is shown. Trelkovsky then lets out a monstrous scream as Simone did in the earlier scene.",

    "Synopsis": "Pinky Rose, a timid and awkward young woman, starts working at a health spa for the elderly in a small California desert town. She becomes enamored of Millie Lammoreaux, a relentlessly outgoing and self-absorbed co-worker who talks incessantly. Despite their stark personality differences, Pinky and Millie become roommates at the Purple Sage Apartments, owned by the drinking, womanizing, has-been Hollywood stunt double Edgar Hart and his wife Willie, a mysterious pregnant woman who rarely speaks and paints striking and unsettling murals. Millie takes Pinky along on her visits to Dodge City, a local tavern and shooting range also owned by Willie and Edgar, where Millie continues expounding her petty opinions and interests to her new roommate. Millie's babble alienates most of her co-workers, neighbors, acquaintances and would-be suitors; Pinky is the only person in Millie's orbit who enjoys listening to her. Tensions begin to arise between Millie and Pinky after Millie's old roommate, Deidre, hastily cancels plans for a dinner in which Millie had invested much time and effort. Millie storms out of the apartment and returns with a drunken Edgar. Pinky begs Millie to consider Edgar's pregnant wife and not have sex with him. Millie, angry at what she perceives as Pinky's meddling and sabotaging her social life, yells at her and suggests she move out of the apartment. A distraught Pinky jumps off the apartment balcony into the swimming pool. Pinky survives the suicide attempt but falls into a coma. Millie, feeling responsible, visits her in the hospital daily. When Pinky still fails to wake up, Millie contacts Pinky's parents in Texas, hoping their presence at the hospital will help her regain consciousness. When Pinky wakes up, she does not recognize her parents and furiously demands that they leave. Once sent home to live with Millie again, Pinky copies Millie's mannerisms and behavior, including drinking, smoking, sleeping with Edgar, and shooting guns at Dodge City. She insists on being called Mildred, both women's birth name. Millie becomes increasingly frustrated by Pinky's imitative shift in personality and begins to exhibit Pinky's timid and submissive personality herself. One night after Pinky has a bad dream, she shares a bed with Millie platonically. Edgar, soused again, enters their apartment and makes sexual overtures before casually telling them that Willie is about to give birth. Pinky and Millie drive to Edgar and Willie's house, where Willie is alone and in agonizing labor. Her baby is stillborn after Edgar abandoned her and Pinky failed to follow Millie's instructions to summon medical help. Later, Pinky and Millie are working at Dodge City, having again changed roles: Pinky has reverted to her childlike timidity and refers to Millie as her mother, while Millie has assumed Willie's role in running the tavern, even imitating Willie's makeup and attire. When a delivery driver says it was a shame about Edgar dying, Millie offers a pat, hollow reply which suggests the three women are complicit in his death.",

    "Synopsis": "thumb|left|300px|Gabriele (Marcello Mastroianni|Mastroianni) and Antonietta (Loren) in her living room On 4 May 1938, the day Hitler visits Mussolini in Rome, Antonietta, a naïve, sentimental and overworked homemaker, stays home doing her usual domestic tasks, while her fascist husband, Emanuele, and their six spoiled children take to the streets to follow a parade. The building is empty, except for the caretaker Pauletta and a neighbor across the complex, a charming man named Gabriele. He is a radio broadcaster who has been dismissed from his job and is about to be deported to Sardinia because of his homosexuality and alleged anti-fascist stance. After the family's myna escapes from their apartment and flies outside Gabriele's window, Antonietta shows up at his door, asking to be let in to reach the bird. Gabriele has been interrupted from attempting suicide, but helps rescue the myna by offering it food, and is amused by the episode. Antonietta is surprised by his demeanor and, unaware of his sexual orientation, flirts and dances the rumba with him. Despite their differences, they warm to each other. Pauletta warns Antonietta that Gabriele is an anti-fascist, which Antonietta finds despicable. Gabriele eventually opens up, confessing he was fired because he is a homosexual. Antonietta confides in him about her troubles with her arrogant and unfaithful husband, who, she says, has shown a preference for an educated woman. Throughout their interaction and conversation, each realizes that the other is oppressed by social and governmental conditioning and comes to form a new impression of the other than the one they first drew from one another. As a result, they have sex, but for different reasons. Gabriele explains that this changes nothing, as does Antonietta. (However, later, when her son reminds his mother of all the newspaper clippings she will have from the parade for her album collection, Antonietta's face reveals a look of slight indifference.) Soon after their intimate encounter, Antonietta's family comes back home, and Gabriele is arrested. At the end, Antonietta sits near the window and starts reading a book Gabriele has given to her (The Three Musketeers). She watches as her lover leaves the complex, escorted by fascist policemen, before turning off the light and retiring to bed: Her husband is waiting there for her to beget their seventh child, whom he wants to name Adolfo.",

    "Synopsis": "Giovanni Vivaldi (Alberto Sordi) is a petty bourgeois, modest white-collar worker nearing retirement in a public office in the capital. His life is divided between work and family. With his wife Amalia (Shelley Winters) he shares high hopes for his son, Mario (Vincenzo Crocitti), a newly qualified accountant, not a particularly bright boy who willingly assists his father's efforts to make him hired in the same office. The father, in an attempt to guide his son, emphasizes the point of practicing humility in the presence of his superiors at work, and he enrolled himself in a Masonic lodge to help him gain friendships and favoritisms that, at first, he would never hope to have. Just as the attempts of Giovanni Vivaldi seems to turn to success, his son Mario is killed, hit by a stray bullet during a shootout that erupts following a robbery in which the father and son are accidentally involved. Misfortune and sufferings consequently distort the lives, beliefs and morality of the Vivaldis. Amalia becomes ill, loses her voice and becomes seriously handicapped. Giovanni, now blinded by grief and hatred, throws himself headlong into an isolated and desperate quest. He identifies his son's murderer, abducts him, takes him to a secluded cabin and submits him to torture and violence, eventually bringing the killer of his child to a slow death. Then, for Giovanni arrives - at his set date - his retirement and, only a day later, the death of his wife, who had by now been overcome by her disability. Giovanni is now prepared with serenity and resignation to live into old age, but a spontaneous verbal confrontation with a young idler revives in him the role of an executioner who will, presumably, kill again.",

    "Synopsis": "In London in the late 1970s, Guyanese immigrant Ben Jones arrives at Heathrow Airport with a suitcase and a wallet full of money. Immigration officials refuse to believe his naïve explanation that the cash was given by his grandmother, and strip-search him. Humiliated and confused, Ben travels to Brixton in search of an obscure address. A ten-year-old boy, Devon, spots him and offers to help find the address if Ben pays him. When Ben foolishly reveals his fat wallet, Devon runs off with it, and Ben is forced to sleep at the local hostel. Dave King, a charismatic petty crook and lover of Devon's mother Miriam, pretends to be a responsible adult and intercepts Ben's wallet, but he keeps the money knowing that Devon has stolen it. That evening, Dave tries to seduce Miriam but she resists him, explaining that she has recently become pregnant. An argument ensues and Miriam forces Dave to leave. Ben almost loses his suitcase at the hostel, but defends himself against the thief. In an attempt to find his missing wallet he follows Devon around Brixton, but is sidetracked by Devon's beautiful aunt Saffra. At Miriam's café, Ben confronts Devon about the stolen wallet but Dave intercedes and calms the situation, hiding Devon's guilt and befriending Ben by loaning him some money. Unaware that Dave's cash comes from his own stolen wallet, Ben accompanies Dave to a betting shop and defends him in a brawl. They place a bet on a horse that wins and Ben puts his winnings towards new accommodation. He finds a job as a dustman but loses it all again when he gives his earnings to a fraudulent landlord. Desperate for somewhere to stay, Ben appeals to Dave to share a flat. Once he realises that Ben now has a steady income Dave agrees to the flat-share and imposes a set of slanted rules that Ben is too naïve to reject. Ben uses his new income to decorate the flat and tries to impress Saffra. He gives her a family heirloom – a ring – but Saffra returns it because it is financially worthless. Dave realises that Ben is still a virgin and arranges a trip to Soho where they visit sex shops, strip clubs and a prostitute. At a nightclub Ben meets Sally, a white woman who seduces him, and that night he loses his virginity. Dave loses all his money in a poker game and goes to Miriam. She is furious and upset, having just returned from an abortion clinic. Dave is hurt that the unborn child has been aborted without his knowledge but this serves to anger Miriam more. With encouragement from Sally, Ben confronts Dave about the degree to which he has abused their friendship. Dave implies that Ben's naivety was as much to blame for his being duped as Dave's own immoral behaviour. Ben, now wiser, agrees to remain friends. In a bid to cement his relationship with Miriam and Ben, Dave takes advantage of a car deal arranged by Jomo, a loan shark and sometime boyfriend of Saffra. Taking Jomo's new Buick and money, he drives Miriam, Ben and Saffra to Margate for an overnight trip. The four spend a lot of money and Dave loses the rest at a casino. Ben and Saffra sleep together but Saffra remains non-committal. In the morning Dave approaches Ben for some cash to pay the bills he cannot afford. Ben refuses, but suggests that he buys Jomo's car and insists on a receipt. Dave reluctantly agrees and the group return to London. Once in Brixton, Ben refuses to resell the Buick, putting Dave in a dangerous position with Jomo. Jomo tries to force the sale but is overpowered by Ben who makes it clear he will not be bullied. Jomo backs down and Dave is thankful. Devon and Saffra join Ben in the Buick and they drive away.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1936, amid the Great Depression, Woody Guthrie performs guitar at a gas station. A customer offers $1 to anyone who can address his worries, and Guthrie succeeds by providing a satisfactory answer. Subsequently, Guthrie begins painting a sign but frustrates his wife, Mary, by abandoning the task—their only reliable source of income—to engage in music instead. At a local bar, Guthrie performs for a woman named Sue Ann and spends the night with her. On his porch, he encounters Heavy Chandler, a recently released mental patient, and encourages him to express his thoughts through painting. After performing at a square dance, a dust storm compels everyone indoors. Guthrie suggests to Mary that he should leave to seek work, and eventually, he departs, leaving her a note. During his travels, Guthrie rides a train with Slim Snedeger and other hobos. When a fight breaks out, Guthrie and Slim jump to another train; however, railroad enforcers compel those without money to disembark. Slim is able to afford the fare, but Guthrie, being broke, continues on foot, and they part ways. Guthrie later offends a middle-class couple who provide him a ride, leading them to drop him off. In a bar, he earns a meal by playing the piano and spends the night with a waitress. He subsequently rides with a family bound for California, but at the state border, police demand $50 for entry. Guthrie leaves the family and joins a nearby hobo camp. In Los Angeles, he meets Luther and Liz Johnson, a migrant couple struggling to find employment. Upon discovering that jobs are both scarce and poorly compensated, Guthrie offers to paint a sign at a soup kitchen, but his only recompense is a serving of soup. Later, union organizer Ozark Bule arrives at the camp, performing union songs. When company thugs disrupt the gathering, Guthrie escapes with Ozark, who assists him in obtaining a radio job where Guthrie's songs about the working class achieve popularity. However, station owner Mr. Locke insists that Guthrie refrain from singing about unions and instead focus on entertainment. Although Guthrie initially acquiesces, he eventually resumes performing protest songs, resulting in conflict with Locke. Ultimately refusing to compromise, Guthrie is dismissed from his position. He brings Mary and their children to Los Angeles, but he feels out of place amid the wealth surrounding him. Luther, bruised from a beating, informs Guthrie that his songs provide inspiration to the laborers. Frustrated, Guthrie tears up a list of \"safe\" songs, leaves the studio, and resumes traveling, performing protest songs at migrant camps and factories. While performing at a fruit-packing plant, Guthrie is assaulted by company enforcers, who destroy his guitar. Undeterred, he continues to travel by train and perform his songs. Upon returning to Los Angeles, Locke extends one final opportunity to Guthrie, but he is terminated once again after dedicating a song to farm workers. As Guthrie departs, Ozark informs him that an agent has arranged a coast-to-coast radio show for him and secured an audition at the prestigious Ambassador Hotel. Guthrie purchases toys for his children, only to discover that Mary and the girls have already left. During the hotel audition, the owner offers him a position but insists on dressing him in overalls and presenting him as part of a hillbilly act. Refusing to cater to the wealthy, Guthrie walks out, returns to the railroad yard, hops on a train, and resumes singing protest songs from the top of a boxcar, remaining true to his roots.",

    "film_title": "Car Wash (film)",
    "Synopsis": "Over a single Friday in July, the Dee-Luxe Car Wash welcomes all manner of strange and unusual visitors. A hysterical wealthy woman from Beverly Hills arrives with a carsick son. Money-hungry evangelist \"Daddy Rich,\" who preaches a pseudo-gospel of prosperity theology, appears with his loyal (and singing) entourage, The Wilson Sisters. The employees must also deal with a man they believe is the notorious \"pop bottle bomber\" being sought that day by the police. It alarms employees, customers, and the owner of the car wash, Leon \"Mr. B\" Barrow, but the strange man's \"bomb\" turns out to be simply a urine sample he is taking to the hospital for a liver test. Mr. B's son Irwin Barrow, a left-wing college student who smokes pot in the men's restroom and carries around a copy of Quotations from Chairman Mao, insists on spending a day with the \"working class\" employees, whom he considers \"brothers\" in the \"struggle\". As he prepares for work, he sets off motion sensors that give him the first \"human car wash,\" which he graciously accepts (though while pot-induced). A taxi driver searches fruitlessly for a prostitute named Marleen, who stiffed him for a fare earlier and has her own hopes shattered later on as a customer with whom she apparently has fallen in love has given her a false telephone number. Abdullah Mohammed Akbar, formerly known as Duane, is a tall Black revolutionary and recent convert to Islam who dismisses Daddy Rich's preaching when the quartet visits and collects donations from the employees. Middle-aged ex-convict Lonnie, the foreman of the car wash, tries to mentor Abdullah while struggling to raise two young children and fend off his parole officer. Abdullah confronts the flamboyant homosexual Lindy and sharply criticizes his cross-dressing, to which Lindy replies, \"Honey, I am more man than you'll ever be and more woman than you'll ever get.\" Theodore Chauncey \"T.C.\" Elcott, another young employee, is determined to win a radio call-in contest to get tickets for a rock concert and to convince his estranged girlfriend Mona, a waitress working in a diner across the street, to accompany him, eventually succeeding. Musicians Floyd and Lloyd, who have an audition for an agent when their shift ends, rehearse their jazz-blues dance moves in front of bewildered customers. An employee named Justin clashes with his girlfriend, Loretta, who wants him to return to college, but he declines, feeling that a black man like him will not get anywhere in the world with any kind of education. His elderly grandfather, Snapper, works as the shoe shine man at the car wash and is a Daddy Rich follower. Other employees include womanizer Geronimo (\"married three and a half times\"), a thin African-American with feathers in his hair; cowboy Scruggs, the gas pump operator worried about having caught a \"social disease\" the night before; overweight, good-natured Hippo, who is constantly listening to his transistor radio and hooks up with Marleen; a scheming, jokester Latino named Chuco; a Native American named Goody, who wears a homemade hat with a pig face, tail, and pointy ears; scruffy, middle-aged Charlie; con artist and bookie Sly, who later gets arrested for a series of unpaid parking tickets; and the \"holier than thou\" Earl, who sees himself as superior to his colleagues because he does not get wet (since he waxes the cars). Among everything, Mr. B frequently flirts with the young, busty cashier/receptionist Marsha to escape his troubled home life. Constantly tense, he worries about his car wash going out of business due to a competitor a few miles down the street. Lonnie, conversely, has numerous ideas on how to save the car wash, but everyone else, including the miserly Mr. B, ignores him. Later, Abdullah, after being fired by Mr. B for his unexplained absences from work for the past several weeks, appears in the office with a gun while Lonnie is closing up, intending to rob the business. Lonnie dissuades him, knowing where a life of crime will lead. The day ends sorrowfully as everyone goes their separate ways.",

    "film_title": "Iphigenia (film)",
    "Synopsis": "Iphigenia tells the story of an event just before the Trojan War. Helen, Menelaus' wife, ran away to Troy with Paris, Priam's son. Agamemnon, Menelaus' brother and the King of Argos, gathered a large Greek expedition at Aulis to retrieve Helen. However, Artemis, angered by an offense from Agamemnon's father, King Atreus, caused storms to hinder the Greek fleet. This sets the stage for the film's beginning. The Greek armies have been waiting for what feels like an eternity for the winds to rise and blow eastward, carrying their boats to Troy. The men are tired, bored, hungry, and eager for battle. In an attempt to appease them, Agamemnon (Costa Kazakos) allows them to take sheep from a nearby temple dedicated to Artemis. In the chaos that ensues, Artemis' sacred deer is accidentally killed. This angers Calchas (Dimitris Aronis), the high priest of Artemis' temple, who delivers an oracle to Agamemnon in the presence of Menelaus (Kostas Karras) and Odysseus (Christos Tsagas). According to Calchas, the oracle, believed to be from Artemis herself, demands that Agamemnon offer a sacrifice to atone for the defilement of the holy ground and the killing of the sacred stag. Once the sacrifice is made, Artemis will allow the winds to blow eastward, permitting the armies to sail to Troy. The sacrifice demanded is Agamemnon's first-born daughter, Iphigenia (Tatiana Papamoschou). News of \"the deal\" spreads quickly among the army, although the exact nature of the sacrifice remains temporarily unknown to them. After a heated argument between the two brothers, Agamemnon sends a message to his wife, Clytemnestra (Irene Papas), in Argos. In the letter, Agamemnon requests that his wife send their daughter, Iphigenia, alone to Aulis, supposedly to marry Achilles (Panos Mihalopoulos). Achilles, the leader of the Myrmidon army, is part of Agamemnon's expeditionary forces. Despite her husband's instructions, Clytemnestra decides to accompany her daughter to Aulis. From this point on, the tension and tragedy intensify. Agamemnon begins to doubt his plan. After admitting his deception to his old servant (Angelos Yannoulis), Agamemnon sends him with another letter to Clytemnestra, revealing the deal and urging her to cancel Iphigenia's journey. However, Menelaus' men intercept the servant on the road and bring him back to Aulis. In the ensuing confrontation, Menelaus condemns his brother for sacrificing Greece's honor for personal interests. Agamemnon challenges this argument convincingly, persuading Menelaus that no war is worth the life of a child. Following their agreement, Agamemnon decides to deliver the letter to Clytemnestra personally, but it's too late. A messenger announces the imminent arrival of the wedding party, including Clytemnestra. Agamemnon is stunned by the news and resigns himself to fate: \"From now on, fate rules. Not I.\" Upon Clytemnestra's arrival at Aulis, she is filled with happiness about her daughter's impending marriage to the renowned Myrmidon leader, Achilles. However, Iphigenia's first encounter with her father is fraught with double entendre, which is devastating: as she speaks of her upcoming wedding, he speaks of her impending sacrifice. Although they use the same words, their meanings could not be more tragically divergent. When Agamemnon meets with Clytemnestra, he futilely attempts to persuade her to return to Argos without witnessing the \"wedding\". Clytemnestra and Achilles soon discover the truth from Agamemnon's aged servant. Achilles is overwhelmed with shame and anger upon learning of the deception that has ensnared him in this tragedy. Clytemnestra erupts into fury and, in desperation, confronts her husband one last time. However, Agamemnon is ensnared in his own trap and cannot retreat, as Odysseus has threatened to disclose the true nature of the sacrifice to the army if Agamemnon fails to comply with the oracle's demand. Meanwhile, preparations for the sacrifice progress swiftly. \"Let's not delay; the wind is picking up,\" declares Calchas. Odysseus finally takes action by revealing the chosen sacrificial victim to the army. With this revelation, there is no turning back. Although Iphigenia briefly manages to escape, she is soon captured by Odysseus' soldiers. In a poignant scene reminiscent of the dying sacred stag at the film's outset, Iphigenia is found lying exhausted and breathless on the forest floor, evoking a sense of impending tragedy. Her captors return her to the camp to face her fate. Resigned to her destiny, she shares a heartrending final meeting with her father before ascending the hill towards her fate. Meanwhile, Agamemnon, surrounded by his jubilant army, watches helplessly from below as Iphigenia reaches the summit and is swiftly seized by Calchas. At that moment, as the wind rises, Agamemnon rushes up the steps. Upon reaching the hilltop, his expression reflects the assumed sight of his daughter's demise. With a strong wind now blowing, the men hasten to the beach, launching their ships into the sea and setting sail towards Troy and its promised riches.",

His tyrannical peasant father (Omero Antonutti) barges in and announces to the teacher and the students that Gavino must leave school and tend to the family sheep. Under his father's watchful eyes and the victim of his sadistic behavior, Gavino spends the next fourteen years tending sheep in the Sardinian mountains. There, he begins to discover \"things\" for himself and rebels against his father. Gavino is rescued from his family and isolation when he is called for military service. During his time with the army, he learns about electronics, the Italian language, and classical music, yearning all the while for a university education. When Gavino returns home, he declares to his father that he will attend university. His father is against this and tells him that he will throw him out of the family home. They have a nasty fight, but Gavino eventually attends university and emerges as a brilliant student. He becomes a linguist, specializing in the origins of the Sardinian language. The film ends again in a documentary style as Gavino Ledda himself explains why he wrote his book and what Sardinian children may expect as inhabitants of a rural area with close ties to the land.",

    "film_title": "The American Friend",
    "Synopsis": "Tom Ripley is a rich American living in Hamburg, Germany. He is involved in an artwork forgery scheme, in which he drives up auction prices of supposedly newly found—but really newly produced—paintings by an artist who has faked his own death. At an auction he is introduced to Jonathan Zimmermann, a picture framer who has framed one of the fakes in good faith and is dying of leukemia. Zimmermann refuses to shake Ripley's hand when introduced, coldly saying, \"I've heard of you,” before walking away. Raoul Minot, a French criminal, asks Ripley to murder an American gangster. Ripley declines, but, to get even for Zimmermann's slight, suggests Minot use Zimmermann for the job. Ripley spreads rumors that Zimmermann's illness has suddenly worsened, and Minot offers Zimmermann a great deal of money to kill the gangster. Zimmermann initially turns Minot down, but fearing that he might not have long to live, he joins Minot in France to get a second medical opinion. Minot has the results falsified to make Zimmermann expect the worst, and so Zimmermann agrees to shoot the gangster in a Paris Métro station to provide for his wife Marianne and his son Daniel. Ripley visits Zimmermann in his shop before and after the shooting, ostensibly to get a picture framed. Zimmermann is unaware of Ripley's involvement in the murder plot, and the two begin to form a bond after Zimmermann apologizes for being rude to Ripley when they first met. Minot visits Ripley to report his satisfaction with Zimmermann's performance in the murder. Ripley, who has grown to like Zimmermann, is appalled when Minot wants Zimmermann to kill another American gangster in order to trigger a gang war among his rivals. This time, however, he will be on an intercity express train, and using a garrote. This gangster nearly overpowers Zimmermann, but Ripley appears out of the shadows and saves Zimmermann. He and Ripley jointly execute the target, and throw his body and a bodyguard from the train. Back in Hamburg, Ripley confesses to suggesting Zimmermann to Minot. When Zimmermann offers him the money for the second hit, he declines and asks Zimmermann not to divulge his involvement. Leading a double life causes tension in Zimmermann's marriage, as Marianne does not believe his cover stories of traveling and getting paid for experimental treatments. Marianne eventually leaves with Daniel, causing him to collapse. Minot arrives to find out if Zimmermann knows why his flat was recently bombed. When Zimmermann mentions that \"we\" killed the man on the train, Minot suspects Ripley has turned on him. Zimmermann calls Ripley, who takes Zimmermann to his mansion to wait for the assassins that he expects will soon appear. He and Zimmermann ambush and kill the American gangsters that arrive. Minot, who has been captured and beaten by the Americans, escapes in the chaos. Ripley piles the bodies into the ambulance the gangsters brought, but before he and Zimmermann can leave to dispose of them, Marianne arrives and tells Zimmermann that the French medical reports are fake. Ripley says there will be plenty of time to settle everything later, but he and Zimmermann could use her help with their current situation. The trio head to the sea, Ripley in the ambulance, and Marianne driving her exhausted husband in their car. On an isolated beach, Ripley douses the ambulance with gasoline and sets it on fire. Zimmermann gets in the driver's seat of his car and speeds away with Marianne, abandoning Ripley. Moments later, he blacks out and dies at the wheel and the car goes out of control, but Marianne pulls the emergency brake and survives. At the beach, Ripley says to himself, \"Oh well. We made it anyway, Jonathan. Be careful.\"",

    "film_title": "The Duellists",
    "Synopsis": "thumb|The last duel takes place in a ruin, with each combatant armed with two pistols. In Strasbourg in 1800, Lieutenant Gabriel Feraud of the French 7th Hussars, a fervent Bonapartist and obsessive duellist, nearly kills the nephew of the city's mayor in a duel. Under pressure from the mayor, Brigadier-General Treillard orders one of his officers, Lieutenant Armand d'Hubert of the 3rd Hussars, to place Feraud under house arrest. When d'Hubert delivers the order, Feraud takes it as a personal insult and challenges him to a duel. D'Hubert does all he can to avoid Feraud's unreasonable demand for a duel but is finally left with no honorable way to avoid it. The result is inconclusive, as Feraud gets knocked unconscious before the fight ends. Then d'Hubert is attacked by Feraud's mistress, leaving his face scratched. As a result of the fight, the General dismisses d'Hubert from his staff and returns him to active duty with his regiment. The war interrupts the quarrel and the two do not meet again until six months later. Feraud challenges d'Hubert to another duel and seriously wounds him. While recovering, d'Hubert's lover, Laura, takes care of him and encourages him to end the pointless duels. Instead he takes fencing lessons from a master swordsman, and in the next duel the men fight to a bloody standstill, too tired to hold their swords. They fall to the ground in a wrestle but this is broken apart by the onlookers. Soon afterwards, d'Hubert is relieved to learn he has been promoted to captain, as military discipline forbids officers of different ranks from duelling. By 1806, d'Hubert's unit has been stationed in Lübeck. He is shocked to hear that the 7th Hussars have arrived in the city and that Feraud is now also a captain. Aware that in two weeks time he is to be promoted to major, d'Hubert attempts to slip away but fails to do it in time. Feraud challenges him to another duel. Before it, d'Hubert happens upon his former lover Laura. She chastises him for continuing to duel Feraud, saying that he will eventually be killed, before bidding him a tearful farewell. In the encounter, which takes place on horseback, d'Hubert slashes Feraud's forehead; with blood flowing into his eyes, Feraud is not capable of continuing the duel. Considering himself the victor, d'Hubert leaves the field ebullient, jumping his horse over a cart. Soon afterwards, Feraud's regiment is posted to Spain while d'Hubert remains stationed in Northern Europe. The pair (both now colonels) chance upon each other during the French Army's retreat from Moscow, but are forced to cooperate after being separated from the main force. Feraud asks for volunteers to go after Russian Cossacks and d'Hubert is the only one who will go with him. On foot they are surprised by one of the enemy on horseback, with three others in the distance. Feraud shoots the one closest to them and d'Hubert drives off the others by firing at them. Then d'Hubert jokes \"Pistols next time\", referring to their next duel and offers Feraud a celebratory drink from his flask, but Feraud silently turns and walks away. After Napoleon's exile to Elba, d'Hubert is now a brigadier-general recovering from a wartime injury at the home of his sister Leonie in Tours. She introduces him to Adele, the niece of her neighbour, and the couple fall in love. Colonel Perteley, a Bonapartist agent, attempts to recruit d'Hubert as rumours of Napoleon's imminent return from exile abound, but d'Hubert refuses. When Feraud, now a Bonapartist brigadier-general, learns this, he declares he always knew d'Hubert was a traitor. thumb|Napoleon on Saint Helena by Franz Josef Sandmann. After Napoleon is defeated at Waterloo, d'Hubert marries Adele and joins the army of Louis XVIII. Feraud is arrested and is expected to be executed for his part in the Hundred Days war. Learning of this, d'Hubert calls upon the Minister of Police and persuades him to spare Feraud. Not knowing d'Hubert saved him, Feraud is paroled to live under police supervision. Meanwhile, d'Hubert and Adele prepare for the birth of their first child. After learning of d'Hubert's promotion in the new French Army, an incensed Feraud sends two of his former officers to d'Hubert's estate with a challenge for a pistol duel. Reluctantly, d'Hubert agrees. The next day the two men meet in a field near the ruins of a castle. Each man is armed with two single-shot pistols to be fired at will. After some solitary wandering, the men unknowingly end up within 50 feet of each other. Feraud sees d'Hubert and fires his first shot, missing. D'Hubert plays dead for a moment, coaxing Feraud to fire his second shot, which also misses. D'Hubert's own first shot misses Feraud, but he now has his opponent at point blank range with the only remaining loaded pistol. D'Hubert calmly stands and takes aim while Feraud screams \"Go on. Kill me!\". As d'Hubert calmly walks home, he is heard in voiceover telling Feraud that, by all rights and honor, he now owns Feraud's life. D'Hubert tells Feraud that as such, he will simply declare Feraud dead, and that in all future matters concerning the two of them, Feraud shall conduct himself as a dead man and never challenge d'Hubert to another duel or bother his family. D'Hubert returns to his home and pregnant wife to live out the rest of his days in peace. Feraud, on the other hand, returns to his solitary provincial imprisonment, walking disconsolately through the woods, never again to pursue his obsession of dueling.",

    "Synopsis": "The film opens with an epigraph quoting the writer Alexander Tvardovsky: \"Children and war—there is no more horrifying convergence of opposites in the world.\" Writer Alexey Bartenev returns to the city where he spent his childhood. Having grown up in an orphanage after losing his parents during the war—his father died on the front lines, and his mother took her own life when Alexey was still an infant—he embarks on a quest to reconnect with his past. His search centers on finding his two brothers, whom he does not remember. Through archival records, he uncovers the fate of his siblings. His sister, Natasha, died in 1947. His older brothers were adopted by different families: Sergey Pogartsev became a habitual criminal and was serving his third prison sentence when Alexey found him. Meanwhile, Denis Kuskov, the middle brother, was adopted by a high-ranking Party official and grew up in relative comfort, unlike the rest of his family. Natasha had once visited Denis but experienced a cold reception, the details of which she chose not to share with Alexey. When Alexey attempted to meet Denis himself, Denis feigned ignorance of their connection. Years later, as an adult, Denis admitted that he remembered everything and expressed regret for his behavior. The film recounts Alexey's fragmented memories of a harsh post-war childhood in Odessa. Scenes include Alexey, pretending to be mute, teaming up with a group of street children and his sister Natasha to trade a stolen gramophone for a piece of bread. In another episode, the children attempt to steal food from an apartment by distracting a woman with a chicken. Natasha provides the diversion while Alexey sneaks into the apartment via the balcony. However, a neighbor who is a policeman catches Alexey and turns him over to a state shelter for orphans. Determined to stay together, Natasha voluntarily joins her brother in the orphanage. The film concludes with a voiceover reading excerpts from Gennady Shpalikov's poem \"By Misfortune or by Happiness,\" capturing the somber tone of Alexey’s story and the lasting scars of war and loss.",

    "film_title": "A Dream of Passion",
    "Synopsis": "Maya, a Greek actress who has been working in Hollywood for years, has returned to Athens to play the title role in a stage production of Euripides' Medea. The film follows three main storylines: (a) the production of the play, (b) Maya’s changing approach to how to portray Medea, and (c) the story of Brenda Collins’ murder of her children. These three storylines are intertwined. Early in the film, we see early scenes from the play being rehearsed, the play’s director and Maya argue about Maya’s (first) interpretation of the character of Medea, and Brenda Collins is introduced. In the middle part of the film, scenes from the middle of the play are rehearsed, and Maya's thoughts about Medea begin to change as she learns more about Brenda Collins’ troubled marriage and as her exploration of Medea makes her rethink some difficult episodes in her own life. In the last part of the film, Maya thinks more deeply about her own life, learns more details about the murders of children, and we see scenes from the end of the play—showing Maya’s final interpretation of Medea. The production of the play is being filmed by a BBC crew. Early in the film, one of Maya's BBC contacts manages to arrange a publicity stunt for Maya, in which Maya will meet an American woman, Brenda Collins, who was imprisoned several years earlier for the murder of her three young children. The Collins family had lived in a suburb of Athens, Glyfada. Brenda committed the murders to punish her husband, Roy, for having an affair with a Greek woman. The press at the time called her \"the Medea of Glyfada.\" Maya happily imagines what the headlines will be after their meeting: \"The Two Medeas.\" The publicity stunt ends in disaster. Brenda is initially happy and excited about talking with Maya, having never met a movie star before, but she is frightened and then infuriated when the press suddenly rushes into the interview room, snapping photos. She screams obscenities and curses at Maya as a nun pulls Brenda out of the room. Maya is horrified at how the stunt turned out and later sends flowers and a note of apology to Brenda. Brenda agrees to meet Maya again, and the two establish something of a friendship. To learn more about Brenda Collins, Maya goes to see the publisher of the Kathimerini newspaper, a woman she already knows. She shows Maya the records the paper still has from their coverage of the case, including crime-scene photos, a copy of the note Brenda left for Roy after the murders, and the notes of a psychologist who examined Brenda after the murders. Maya also visits the Collins' former house (which has remained unoccupied—the chalk outlines are still on the floor, showing where the children's bodies were found) and meets with Brenda several more times at the prison. Brenda Collins is a deeply religious woman. She had been devoted to her husband and children and had begged Roy to stop his affair, but he treated her and her faith with disdain. She talks about the events leading up to the murders and the murders themselves with a mix of anguish and fury and a mix of obscenities and quotes from the Bible. She says that she did not kill her children with the story of Medea in mind; she tells Maya that she didn't understand the reference when the press first started calling her a \"Medea.\" Maya's research into Brenda's case, looking at it from Brenda's point of view and having rethought difficult events in her own life (in particular, her relationship with her own somewhat estranged husband and her friendship with and later mistreatment of Maria—who was once an actress and is now the prompter for the stage production), causes Maya to rethink her portrayal of Medea. The film ends with a scene of the play's production at the ancient theater at the site of the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi.",

    "Synopsis": "The film is set in the end of the 19th century and takes place at an aristocratic estate in the forests of central Russia. The daughter of a forester, Olga Skvortsova (Galina Belyayeva) is a beautiful nineteen-year-old woman. Three middle-aged men who live in the manor and the surrounding area fall in love with her: a 50-year-old gloomy widower Urbenin (Leonid Markov), an even more senior in age but youthful and lighthearted Count Karneev (Kirill Lavrov) and the stately, handsome, 40-year-old court investigator Kamyshev (Oleg Yankovsky). Olga wanting to escape poverty marries the nobleman Urbenin without love. On the day of her wedding she runs away from the celebration and declares her love to Kamyshev but refuses to leave with him. Kamyshev erupts with passion and jealousy and he secretly hopes that he can persuade Olga to be with him. She is under the impression that Urbenin is rich and that with him she will be able to break out of poverty but soon finds out in what lowly conditions her husband lives. After this disappointment she becomes a mistress of the jovial Count Karneev, while her lawful husband Urbenin slowly ruins himself with drink and degenerates in the city. During the autumn hunt and picnic an intense argument happens between Olga and the fiercely jealous Kamyshev and after a few minutes under mysterious circumstances Olga receives a gunshot wound in the depths of the forest thicket. The young woman dies a few days later from severe blood loss without informing the investigators who attacked her at the shooting party. Her husband Urbenin is the main suspect and he is exiled to Siberia and dies four years later. Tormented by pangs of conscience Kamyshev writes a story about the dramatic events and submits it for publication in a journal. After reading the story by Kamyshev it becomes clear to the astute publisher (Olegar Fedoro) who was Olga's real murderer.",

    "Synopsis": "Erica Benton works part-time at a SoHo art gallery and is in a seemingly happy marriage to Martin, a successful businessman. They live together with their teenage daughter Patti in an upscale apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side. Martin, however, has been having a year-long affair with a much younger woman named Marcia. When he confesses to Erica that he loves his mistress and wants to marry her, Erica is devastated, and Martin moves out. With the help of Patti, her circle of close friends, and a therapist, Erica slowly comes to terms with the divorce and begins to get her life back on track. She reluctantly tries dating again, but after Martin's betrayal and a disastrous blind date, she is even warier of ever finding a suitable man again. Her mistrust of men threatens her relationship with Patti, as she takes out her frustrations on Patti's boyfriend, Phil. Out of desperation, Erica has sex with Charlie, an obnoxious, chauvinistic co-worker, but she does not find the experience fulfilling. As she grows more accustomed to her new life, she meets Saul, an abstract painter, and begins a relationship with him. Both value their independence and so have a difficult time adjusting to domestic life. When Patti meets Saul, she is initially hostile, believing Erica is trying to bring him in to replace Martin, which Saul assures Patti is not his intention. After a few tense meetings, Martin and Erica begin to act cordially towards each other, only for Martin to reveal that Marcia has left him and he wants Erica back. Erica rebuffs him. Saul tries to convince Erica to come with him to his home in Vermont for the summer, where he spends five months every year with his children, but she declines, not wishing to leave her daughter and her life behind for so long. Outside Saul's building, Erica helps him lower one of his paintings from his loft to the sidewalk. Shortly before driving away in his car, Saul reveals that the painting is a gift for Erica, leaving her to carry the giant canvas through the busy streets of Manhattan.",

    "Synopsis": "An executive director makes an impassioned speech before a tribunal, pleading for the release of world prisoners held in death camps based on verified testimonial evidence. He steps aside, and allows Inés, an Argentine torture victim, to give her testimony, dressed in a raincoat and with dark glasses to protect her identity. Moved by the speech, Luis, an acting instructor, decides to write a play about victims of political repression and torture. He arrives at the residence of his friend Emilia, who is married to his dentist Manuel. There, she tells Luis about her desire to become an actress. He invites her to study at his drama studio. While Luis is having dental work done by Manuel (and calling his equipment \"medieval torture devices\"), he has a vision of three men apprehending Emilia and blindfolding her in the back of a vehicle. At home, Luis can't sleep. He goes to his desk and uncrumples a threatening letter demanding that he abandon what he's working on or face consequences. The next day, Emilia arrives at Luis's drama school as he's instructing his students to work on their body performance in their acting; at his insistence she joins in, though reluctant to fully participate. In the next scene, Luis is driving along a country road, is suddenly struck by a painful renal colic, parks his vehicle in a field, and lies down on his back, wondering if he's about to die. Manuel and Emilia, driving down the road, see him and stop to assist him. Back at his studio, Luis instructs his students to derive emotional memories from their past to improve their acting. At his residence, Luis receives another threatening letter. Hearing a buzz, he answers the door and finds Emilia, who tells him that Manuel had struck her. Manuel had complained about Emilia's absences from home and mocked her acting pursuits, and she told him she was moving in with Luis. Luis is surprised and first tells her she's made a mess of things, but then agrees to let her live with him, and the two develop a romantic attraction. Sometime later, Luis visits his uncle Andrés, who sells coal in his cellar. During his childhood, Luis had worked for his uncle after his father died and the family business went under, and Andrés had treated him brutally; Luis remembers being caught writing a short poem about mediating on the meaning of life and being insulted by his uncle. With his uncle's permission, Luis ventures into the coal cellar and remembers or imagines cleaning coal dust off in a shower and being seduced by his aunt. At his studio, Luis casts Emilia in the lead role of his play. On their drive home, Luis returns to the same country field and positions himself in a death-like state. Later, while Emilia is rehearsing her part, she dreams of being tortured and blindfolded. Rehearsals continue as Emilia reads her part as the torture victim; meanwhile, Luis receives his final threatening letter. Soon after, Emilia returns to Luis's apartment, which has been vandalized and ransacked. Luis has been brutally beaten but is still conscious. Emilia calls Manuel and begs him to come and call an ambulance, and Luis is rushed to the hospital. The film concludes with the performance of Luis's play; as she finishes her monologue, Emilia is shot dead by assassins, along with Luis and other people onstage, and the audience flees in terror. The camera closes in on Emilia's body.",

    "Synopsis": "The film is set in a darkly surreal and dystopian version of New York City that is mostly devoid of humans and populated only by rats and a few eccentrics. Lafayette is a young French electrician, living on his own in a basement. He works for Andreas Flaxman, the cynical owner of a waxwork museum. The museum is dedicated to recreating scenes from the Roman Empire. He works alongside his friend the sculptor Luigi Nocello. Nocello maintains the varied and often macabre wax displays, such as the Crucifixion of Jesus and the Assassination of Julius Caesar, which fill the museum. Lafayette also works as a lighting technician for a feminist theatre group. After rehearsal one day, the women in the group discuss their next project, and decide to improvise a piece about rape for their next production, contending that women are just as capable of violence as men are; in the middle of their discussion, they knock Lafayette unconscious with a bottle of Coca-Cola, pin him down, and the attractive Angelica volunteers to rape Lafayette. Beside the Hudson River, amidst a construction site of Battery Park City, Lafayette meets Luigi and a band of eccentrics. The group finds an abandoned baby chimpanzee in the palm of a giant King Kong sculpture. Lafayette decides to adopt the chimpanzee. When he brings the chimp with him to the museum, Flaxman warns him that the chimp will rob him of his freedom, if he does not get rid of it. Flaxman is approached by the mysterious Paul Jefferson of the State Foundation for Psychological Research. He convinces the initially resistant Flaxman to transform the face of the sculpture of Julius Caesar into the face of John F. Kennedy. Angelica, who has become enamored with Lafayette, moves into his sordid flat and shares in the care of the infant chimp. However, when Lafayette does not respond to the news that she is pregnant, she moves out. Alone again, he returns one day to find his baby ape eaten by rats. In total despair and needing human contact, he breaks into the waxwork museum, but is met with hostility by the owner. The two fight, and a fire, presumably caused by faulty wiring, consumes them both. Later, Angelica is seen on the shore. She plays happily with her child.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1968 California, Sally, a loyal and conservative military wife, is married to Bob Hyde, a captain in the United States Marine Corps, who is about to be deployed to Vietnam. As a dedicated military officer, Bob sees the deployment primarily as an opportunity for career progress. At first, Sally dreads being left alone, but after a while, she feels liberated. Forced to find housing away from the base, she moves into a new apartment by the beach and buys a sports car. With nothing else to do, she decides to volunteer at a local Veterans Administration (VA) hospital, partially inspired by her bohemian friend Vi Munson, whose brother Bill has come home with grave emotional problems after just two weeks in Vietnam and now resides in the VA hospital. At the hospital, Sally meets Luke Martin, a former high-school classmate. Like his friend Bill, Luke had gone to Vietnam but came back wounded. He is recuperating at the hospital from the injuries he sustained, which left him a paraplegic. Filled with pain, anger, and frustration, Luke is now opposed to the war. He is at first a bitter young man, but as he is increasingly thrown into contact with Sally, a relationship develops. Eventually, Luke is released from the hospital, and, newly mobile with his own wheelchair, begins to rebuild his life. His relationship with Sally deepens. She is also transformed by him, and her outlook on life starts to change. They have happy times, play at the beach, and fall in love. Meanwhile, Bill, traumatized by his experiences at war, commits suicide by injecting air into his veins. Driven by Bill's suicide, Luke chains himself to the gates of a local recruitment center in a vain attempt to stop others from enlisting. Sally and Luke eventually make love, confronting his handicap, with Sally experiencing her first orgasm. However, she does not seek a divorce from her husband, and both she and Luke know that their relationship will have to end when Bob returns home. Bob does return, too soon, claiming that he had accidentally wounded himself in the leg. He is also suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from what he has seen in combat. Bob discovers Sally's affair from Army Intelligence, who has been spying on Luke since the gate incident, and Sally and Luke agree that Sally should try to patch things up with Bob. Bob loses control, confronting the lovers with a loaded rifle, but ultimately turns away. Bob places his neatly folded Marine dress uniform on the beach, takes off his wedding ring, and swims naked out into the ocean to commit suicide.",

    "Synopsis": "Hermann Hermann lives in Berlin during the Weimar Republic. A refugee from Soviet Russia, with a Baltic German father and a wealthy Jewish mother, he has inherited a business making chocolates. His Jewish wife Lydia, voluptuous but not intelligent, has an over-close relationship with her bachelor cousin, a painter called Ardalion. As the Great Depression bites and Nazi thugs start targeting Jewish businesses, with his firm becoming less profitable and Germany less hospitable, Hermann starts dreaming of escape. He already has moments of leaving his body, for example to watch himself making love to his wife, and consults a man he believes to be a Viennese psychiatrist but is in fact a life insurance salesman, who sells Hermann a policy. After watching a film which features a doppelgänger, he sees an unemployed drifter called Felix, who he decides is his double. Felix, bemused as there is no resemblance between them, goes along with the idea when Hermann promises him a job. The work, it emerges, is to act as Hermann's double for a substantial lump sum. Hermann is now able to finalize his plan, which is to erase all traces of his unwelcome existence. After getting Ardalion to write a letter that demands money to leave Lydia and go painting in Switzerland, he shows the letter to the insurance salesman as evidence that he is being blackmailed. Then he tells Lydia that he has a troubled twin brother who is contemplating suicide. He will change clothes with his brother, so that the corpse is taken as his, and lie low in Switzerland. When Lydia has been paid the insurance money, she is to join him there. Having lured Felix to a secluded place in the woods, Hermann dresses Felix up in his own clothes, shaves his facial hair, adjusts his hairstyle and files his nails. Hermann then shoots him dead. Dressed as Felix and with Felix's passport, he goes to a Swiss hotel, where he learns from newspapers that Berlin police are seeking the murderer and suspect it is him. Moving in increasing desperation from village to village, in the end he is spotted by Ardalion and armed police close in. He explains that he is an actor making a film and they must stand aside to let him go on.",

    "film_title": "Midnight Express (film)",
    "Synopsis": "\"The following is based on a true story. It began October 6, 1970 in Istanbul, Turkey.\" On vacation in Istanbul, American college student Billy Hayes straps of hashish bricks to his chest. As he and his girlfriend Susan are about to board a plane back to the US, Billy is frisked by soldiers (who are on high alert for terrorist attacks) who discover the drug. Billy is then arrested by the police and strip-searched. A shadowy American — whom Billy nicknames \"Tex\" for his thick Texan accent — arrives and accompanies Billy to a police station and translates for him. Billy claims he bought the hashish from a taxicab driver. He offers to help police locate the driver in exchange for being released. At a nearby market, Billy points out the driver to police, who approach him; meanwhile Billy attempts to escape, only to be recaptured at gunpoint by Tex. During his first night in Sultanahmet Jail, a freezing-cold Billy sneaks out of his cell and steals a blanket. He is later rousted from his cell and brutally beaten by chief guard Hamidou for the theft. A few days later, Billy awakens in Sağmalcılar Prison, surrounded by fellow Western prisoners Jimmy (an American who stole two candlesticks from a mosque), Max (an English heroin addict), and Erich (a Swedish drug smuggler). Jimmy warns Billy that the prison is dangerous for foreigners and says no one can be trusted, not even young children. Billy meets with his father, a U.S. representative, and a Turkish lawyer to discuss his situation. During Billy's trial, the prosecutor makes a case against him for drug smuggling. The lead judge is sympathetic to Billy and gives him a four-year sentence for drug possession. Billy and his father are devastated, but their Turkish lawyer insists it is a good result because the prosecutor wanted a life sentence. Jimmy wants Billy to join an escape attempt through the prison's subterranean tunnels. Billy, due to be released soon, declines. Jimmy goes alone and is caught, then brutally beaten. Fifty-three days before his release, Billy learns the Turkish High Court in Ankara has overturned his sentence after an appeal by the prosecution. The prosecutor who originally wanted Billy convicted of smuggling rather than the lesser charge of possession finally had his way. Billy has been resentenced to serve 30 years. In desperation, Billy accompanies Jimmy and Max to try to escape through the catacombs below the prison. They give up after running into endless dead-ends. A particularly sycophantic prisoner, Rifki, who routinely acts as an informant in exchange for favors, notifies the guards about the escape attempt. Hamidou suspects Jimmy of being responsible for what happened during the first escape attempt. Jimmy is taken away again for punishment and is never seen again. Billy's imprisonment becomes harsh and brutal: terrifying scenes of physical and mental torture follow one another, and Billy has a breakdown. He brutally beats Rifki, killing him. He is sent to the prison's ward for the insane, where he wanders about in a daze among the other disturbed prisoners. Max is sent there, too. He is seen running from guards for an unknown infraction and is grabbed by Hamidou and severely injured. In 1975, Billy's girlfriend Susan visits him. Devastated by Billy's condition, she tells him he must get out or die. She leaves him a scrapbook with money hidden inside to help Billy escape. Her visit strongly helps Billy to regain his senses. Billy says goodbye to an almost dead Max, telling him to stay alive and promising he will come back for him. Max awakens and is somewhat conscious. Billy tries to bribe Hamidou to take him to the prison hospital, but instead Hamidou forces Billy to a room, then tries to rape him. Billy becomes infuriated. They struggle until Hamidou is killed after being pushed into the wall, his head impaled upon a coat hook. Billy dons the guard's uniform and bluffs his way with his Turkish language skills, walks out of the front door and runs to freedom. \"On the night of October 4th, 1975 Billy Hayes successfully crossed the border to Greece. He arrived home at Kennedy Airport 3 weeks later.\"",

    "Synopsis": "In 1917, during the final months of legal prostitution in Storyville, the red-light district of New Orleans, Louisiana, Hattie is a prostitute working at an elegant brothel run by the elderly, cocaine-addicted Madame Nell. Hattie has given birth to a baby boy and has a 12-year-old daughter named Violet, who lives in the house. When photographer Ernest Bellocq arrives with his camera, aiming to document the sex workers, Hattie and Violet are the only people awake at the time; Madame Nell agrees to let him photograph them after he offers to pay her. Bellocq becomes a fixture in the brothel, photographing the women, mostly Hattie. His photographic activities fascinate the precocious Violet, who believes he's is falling in love with her mother, making her somewhat jealous. Violet is a restless child, frustrated by the lengthy precision of early photography that one must endure to compose and take photographs. Nell decides that Violet is old enough for her virginity to be auctioned off. After a bidding war between regulars, Violet is bought by an apparently \"quiet\" customer. Hattie, meanwhile, wanting to escape her lifestyle, marries a customer and leaves for St. Louis without Violet, whom her new husband believes to be her sister. Hattie promises to return for Violet once she has settled in and explained everything to her new spouse. Violet flees the brothel after being punished for engaging in \"hijinks\" and getting into trouble. She appears on Bellocq's doorstep, asking if he will sleep with and take care of her. He initially refuses, but then takes her in, soon beginning a sexual relationship with the girl. In many ways, their relationship resembles one between a sexually abusive parent and child, with Bellocq standing in for Violet's absent mother and Violet seeking to fill that role subconsciously. Bellocq buys Violet a doll, saying that \"every child should have a doll.\"; she responds saying \"I'm a child to you?!\". Bellocq is entranced by Violet's beauty, youth and photogenic face. She is frustrated by Bellocq's devotion to his photography and lack of care for her as a dependent, as much as he is frustrated by the reality that she is an adolescent girl. Violet eventually returns to Nell's after quarreling with Bellocq, but local social reform groups are forcing the brothels of Storyville to close. Bellocq arrives to wed Violet, ostensibly to protect her from the wider world. Two weeks after the wedding, Hattie and her new husband arrive from St. Louis to collect Violet, claiming that her marriage to Bellocq is illegal without parental consent. Bellocq does not want to let Violet go; she asks if he will go with her and her family. Upon hearing that Violet doesn't to go to St. Louis, he tells her to leave, realizing that schooling and a more conventional life are in the girl's best interest.",

    "film_title": "The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (film)",
    "Synopsis": "Jimmie Blacksmith, child of an Aboriginal mother and a white father, is raised to adulthood by the Reverend Neville and his wife Martha, hoping their influence will civilize him and provide him with greater opportunities in early twentieth century Australia. With a letter of recommendation from his foster family, he goes out in search of work to establish himself, but is taken advantage of by multiple parties. His first employer, Healey, repeatedly shortchanges his pay by nitpicking about his fencebuilding work, and refuses to write a job recommendation to avoid having to admit his illiteracy. Jimmie then works for a local constable, Farrell, who uses him as muscle against other Aboriginals, including having to capture a former friend who is later molested and murdered while in custody, and forced to cover up the death. Jimmie finds some stability working on the farm of the Newby family, although they treat him little better than other employers, and decides to summon and marry a white girlfriend, Gilda Marshall, who is already very pregnant when she arrives to move in with him. Gilda later gives birth to a white child, obviously not fathered by Jimmie; while upset at the public embarrassment, he eagerly embraces being a parent. Shortly after the birth, Jimmie's full-caste half-brother Mort and uncle Tabidgi arrive, and Jimmie enlists their help in his fence-building work. However, Mr. Newby uses their presence as an excuse to deny Jimmie his pay and provisions, claiming the extra men were not part of their arrangement. Meanwhile, Mrs. Newby and a schoolteacher friend Miss Graf try to convince Gilda to take her baby and leave Jimmie for a teaching opportunity in another part of the country, which Gilda refuses. Furious at the mistreatment his family is facing, Jimmie enlists Tabidgi to help put a \"scare\" into the Newby women while the men are away, planning to threaten them with hatchets. The plan backfires and turns into a rampage that leaves Mrs. Newby, Miss Graf, and all the Newby daughters but one infant dead. Jimmie's family flee the compound, and shortly after Tabidgi, Gilda, and the child are left behind as Jimmie and Mort continue on the run. They soon murder Jimmie's previous employer Healey as well, with Jimmie announcing that he has declared war, in the manner he once heard the fighting against the Boers described. As press coverage about Jimmie's killings become nationwide news, a reporter makes regular probing inquiries to his butcher, who he is aware doubles as the city's hangman, about what may take place when Jimmie is captured. Tabidgi, captured and sentenced to death for accessory to murder, tells the court that the killings were not part of the plan and happened on an impulse. Still uncaptured, Jimmie and Mort come upon a schoolteacher, McCready, whom they initially wound by gunfire; he convinces them not to kill him by showing them a newspaper article about their notoriety. They decide to take him as a hostage. As the brothers argue about the morality of their killing of women and children, McCready makes bitterly humorous observations about the influence of white people on the Aborigines. He convinces Jimmie to abandon Mort by indicating that Mort's soul has had none of Jimmie's detrimental white influences. Mort in turn takes McCready to a farm to recover, but is killed by a pursuing group led by the Newby males and Miss Graf's fiancee Dowie Steed. Jimmie himself is shot at in a lake, but manages to crudely tend to his wounds and hide out in a convent. He is found by police, who vainly try to prevent townspeople from beating him as they take him to jail. In the final scene, Jimmie is read the last rites by Rev. Neville in his cell, as the butcher/hangman observes them, and declares that despite the (perceived) unique physical characteristics of Jimmie, his hanging will likely go as normal as any other.",

Over the course of a year, the film portrays the cycles of life. Despite noticing the undercurrents of revolution, the peasants largely remain detached from the political unrest. A communist agitator delivers a speech at a local fair, and a newlywed couple witnesses the arrest of political prisoners during a visit to Milan. As spring arrives, the father of one of the families cuts down a tree to craft wooden clogs (an alder tree, referenced in the title, as its wood was traditionally used for this purpose) for his son to wear to school. This act incurs the wrath of the land-owner, resulting in the family's eviction. The remaining families watch them depart, offering prayers and reflecting on their own precarious circumstances.",

    "Synopsis": "France in the early 1930s: teenager Violette lives with her parents, Baptiste Nozière, a train driver, and Germaine Nozière. Unbeknownst to Baptiste, he is not Violette's father, something known only to the mother and daughter. Rebelling against her petit-bourgeois parents, Violette secretly works as a prostitute. She falls in love with student Jean Dabin, whom she supports with thefts from her parents' as well as her prostitution. Violette's doctor informs her parents that she has contracted syphilis. She convinces them that she has inherited the disease and that they should take a \"medicine\" which is actually poison. The first murder attempt fails and both survive, although her mother is temporarily hospitalised. On the second attempt, her father dies, while the mother again survives. Violette tries to cover up her crime as a suicide, but is tried and convicted, despite her saying that she had been raped by her father (an allegation which the film neither confirms nor refutes). The jury sentences her to death by guillotine, but a voiceover says that her sentence was commuted by degrees to the point that she ultimately left prison after 12 years, married, and had five children.",

John Converse, a disillusioned war correspondent, approaches Ray Hicks, a merchant marine sailor and acquaintance of Converse from the U.S., for help in smuggling a large quantity of heroin from Vietnam to San Francisco, where he will exchange the drugs for payment with Converse's wife Marge, who has become addicted to Dilaudid. When Hicks gets back to the U.S. and discovers he is being followed by thugs connected either to Converse or his suppliers, he goes on the run with Marge and the heroin, and eventually they are pursued by corrupt DEA Agent Antheil, who initially set the deal in motion.

    "Synopsis": "<!-- As WP:FILMPLOT requires, the word count in this section should be 400-700 words. --> In 1969, during the Vietnam War, jaded MACV-SOG operative Captain Benjamin L. Willard is summoned to I Field Force headquarters in Nha Trang. The officers there tell him that U.S. Army Special Forces Colonel Walter E. Kurtz is waging a brutal war against NVA, Viet Cong, and Khmer Rouge forces without permission from his commanders. Kurtz is based at a remote jungle outpost in eastern Cambodia, where he commands American, Montagnard, and local Khmer militia troops who worship him. Willard is ordered to \"terminate Kurtz's command... with extreme prejudice.\" He joins a U.S. Navy river patrol boat (PBR) commanded by the Chief Petty Officer Phillips, with crewmen Lance Johnson, \"Chef\" Hicks, and \"Mr. Clean\" Miller to quietly navigate up the Nùng River to Kurtz's outpost. Before reaching the coastal mouth of the Nùng, they rendezvous with the 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment, a helicopter-borne air assault unit of the 1st Cavalry Division commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore, to coordinate safe entry into the river. Kilgore hasn't been briefed on Willard's mission but becomes more engaged after discovering that Lance, a well-known fellow surfer, is with him. Kilgore agrees to escort the boat through the Nùng's Viet Cong-held coastal mouth and a full-scale air assault is executed on the village with \"Ride of the Valkyries\" playing on loudspeakers. Resisting Kilgore’s attempts to convince Lance to surf with him on the newly conquered beach, Willard gathers the sailors to board the PBR and continue their mission. Going ashore to find mangos, Willard and Chef are surprised by a tiger, leading Chef to have a brief mental breakdown. Willard starts seeing cracks form in the crew. Tensions rise when Willard insists on the priority of his mission over the Chief's usual patrol objectives. Willard partially reveals his orders to convince the Chief of the mission's importance. As Willard studies Kurtz's dossier, he is shocked by Kurtz's mid-career sacrifice by leaving a prestigious Pentagon assignment to join Special Forces, all but destroying his chances for career advancement. At a remote U.S. Army outpost, the boat receives a dispatch bag containing both official and personal mail. Willard learns that another MACV-SOG operative, Special Forces Captain Richard Colby, was sent on an earlier mission identical to Willard's and has since joined Kurtz. Lance activates a smoke grenade while under the influence of LSD, attracting enemy fire, causing Mr. Clean's death. Further upriver, the Chief is impaled by a spear thrown by Montagnards and attempts to kill Willard with the spear point protruding from his chest, but Willard overpowers him. Willard reveals his mission to Chef, now commanding the PBR. They arrive at Kurtz's outpost, a Khmer temple teeming with Montagnards and strewn with the remains of victims. Willard, Chef, and Lance are greeted by an American photojournalist, who praises Kurtz's genius. Willard encounters Colby and five other American soldiers among the Montagnards. He sets out with Lance to find Kurtz, leaving Chef with orders to call in an airstrike on the outpost if the two do not return. In the camp, Willard is bound and brought before Kurtz, then locked in a bamboo cage. One night Kurtz appears and drops Chef's severed head into Willard's lap. Willard is released, and warned not to attempt escape. Kurtz lectures him on his theories of war, praising the ruthlessness of the Viet Cong, and asks Willard to tell his son the truth about his mutiny. As the Montagnards ceremonially kill a water buffalo, Willard assassinates Kurtz with a machete. Kurtz's followers watch Willard depart with Kurtz's writings, and bow down to him. Willard leads Lance back to the PBR, and they depart.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1916, Chicago steelworker Bill accidentally kills his factory foreman during an argument. He flees to the Texas Panhandle with his girlfriend Abby and his young sister Linda. As their train winds its way across the country, an older Linda mulls over these events in voiceover narration. She recalls that a religious man once warned her of a vision of apocalyptic hellfire, and notes that at the Last Judgment, God will rescue the good and turn away the evil. In Texas, a wealthy farmer suffering from an unspecified malady hires as many seasonal shockers as he can find, including Bill and Abby, who pretend to be siblings to deter gossip. Bill overhears a doctor telling the farmer that he has one year left to live. The farmer's accountant encourages him to sell his farm and enjoy his profits, but the farmer decides on staying. The terminally ill farmer takes a liking to Abby, and asks her to stay with him after the harvest. Bill encourages Abby to marry the farmer so that they can inherit his money when he dies. Abby questions whether Bill still loves her. Bill confidently predicts that the farmer will die soon and they will be reunited. Abby marries the farmer and persuades him to let Bill and Linda stay at the farmhouse. The farmer's foreman suspects that Abby and Bill are con artists, but the farmer dismisses the suggestion and distances himself from the foreman. The farmer's health remains stable, foiling Bill's plans. Over time, the shy farmer wins over Abby with his genuine disposition. However, he grows suspicious of Abby's excessively familiar relationship with her \"brother.\" Bill belatedly realizes that Abby has fallen in love with the farmer. He realizes that the only way to salvage the situation is to depart the farm, leaving his little sister with his ex-girlfriend. The farmer tries to be a good father figure to Linda. Bill returns to the farm during the following year's harvest. He admits to Abby that encouraging her to marry another man was a mistake. Before Abby can make a decision, a locust swarm arrives. To save the harvest, the farmer lights controlled fires to smoke out the locusts. However, when he sees Bill, he loses control of himself and chases after Bill with a gun. He accidentally knocks over one of his own lamps, triggering a blaze that destroys much of the harvest. Bill kills the farmer with a screwdriver the next day during a confrontation where the farmer points a revolver at him. Once again, Bill, Abby, and Linda are on the run. With the foreman's help, the police shoot Bill while he tries to escape. Seeking a new life, Abby leaves Linda at a boarding school and departs on a train with soldiers headed for World War I. Later, Linda runs away from the school with a friend from the farm.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1897 in rural Australia, Sybylla, a headstrong, free-spirited young woman, dreams of a better life to the detriment of helping run her family's country farm. Considered a larrikin by her family, Sybylla dreams of having a career in writing or the performing arts. Her parents, upset by her notions of grandeur and believing her to be stalling her life, inform Sybylla that they can no longer afford to keep her in the household. They send her to board with her wealthy maternal grandmother in hopes of teaching her socially accepted manners and behaviour. Upon arriving, Sybylla swiftly feels out of place in her new environs. She is soon courted by two local men, jackaroo Frank Hawdon, whom she ignores, and well-to-do childhood friend Harry Beecham, of whom she grows increasingly fond. Sybylla is sent to spend time at the Beecham estate, and her feelings increase toward Harry. She returns to her grandmother's home when Harry is sent on a tour of their properties, with everyone on both estates coyly approving of their romance. Sybylla's Aunt Helen warns her against Harry's courtship, and advises that Sybylla marry for friendship rather than love. Frank attempts to derail Harry and Sybylla's budding relationship by sparking rumours, which leads to increasing tensions between the two. Harry and Sybylla take turns attempting to make the other jealous at a ball, leading to Harry's surprise proposal. Sybylla gruffly rejects him, to everyone's surprise. Harry later reveals his rush was to protect Sybylla from his potential financial collapse. Sybylla counters by asking Harry to wait while she discovers herself, and asks him to delay his proposal for two years. Sybylla is summoned by her grandmother, and is told she must take a job as governess and housekeeper to the indigent family of an illiterate neighbour to whom her father owes money. Working in squalor, she manages to teach the children to read using the newspapers and book pages wallpapering their home. To her delight, Sybylla is eventually sent home when the parents become incorrectly convinced that she is wooing their eldest son. Harry visits and proposes again, but Sybylla again rejects him, stating her intent to become a writer; she tenderly explains that a marriage between the two would be emotionally damaging. Returning to her family's farm, Sybylla completes a manuscript of her first novel, My Brilliant Career, which she hopefully mails off to a Scottish publishing house.",

    "Synopsis": "Norma Rae Wilson is a worker in a cotton mill that has taken too much of a toll on her family's health for her to ignore their poor working conditions. She is also a single mother with two children by different fathers, one dead and the other negligent, and frequently has flings with other men to alleviate her loneliness and boredom. Initially, management tries to divert her frequent protests by promoting her to \"spot checker\", where she is responsible for ensuring other workers are fulfilling work quotas. She reluctantly takes the job for the pay hike, but when fellow employees, including her father, shun her for effectively being a \"fink\" to the bosses, she demands to be fired. Instead, she is demoted back to the line. Two men enter her life, and that changes her perspective. A former co-worker, Sonny Webster, asks her out after causing trouble for her at the mill. Divorced with a daughter, he proposes marriage after a short courtship; recognizing how long it has been since she met a non-selfish man with whom to keep company, she accepts his offer. After a few charged encounters with Reuben Warshowsky, a union organizer from New York City, Norma Rae listens to him deliver a speech that spurs her to join the effort to unionize her shop. This causes conflict when Sonny observes she's not spending enough time at home and is frequently exhausted when she is present. When her father drops dead at the mill of a heart attack—a death that could have been averted had he been allowed to leave his post early instead of waiting for his allotted break—she is more determined to continue the fight. Management retaliates against the unionization efforts, first by rearranging shifts so that workers are doing more work at less pay and then by posting fliers with racial invective in the hope of dividing white and black workers and diluting the momentum. Warshowsky demands Norma copy down the racist flier word for word to use it as evidence for government sanctions against her mill. When she attempts to transcribe the flier, management tries to stop her, then fires her on the grounds of creating a disturbance and calls the police to remove her from the mill. While awaiting the sheriff, Norma Rae takes a piece of cardboard, writes the word \"UNION\" on it, stands on her work table, and slowly turns to show the sign around the room. The other workers stop their mill machines one by one, and eventually, the room becomes silent. After all the machines have been switched off, Norma Rae is taken to jail but is freed by Reuben. Upon returning home to her family, Norma decides to talk to her children and tell them the story of her life, their questionable parentage, and her recent arrest so they are prepared for any smears that may come from those hoping to discredit her efforts. After a tense exchange with Reuben, Sonny asks her if they have been intimate; she says no but acknowledges, \"he's in my head.\" Sonny, in turn, tells her there's no other woman in his head, and he will always remain with her. An election to unionize the factory occurs. Norma and Reuben listen as best as possible from outside the mill as reporters and TV cameras observe the vote count. With a difference of just 100 votes, the union wins. Shortly after, Reuben says goodbye to Norma; despite being smitten with her, they shake hands because he knows she is married and loves her husband, and Reuben heads back to New York.",

    "Synopsis": "The film is set in Dubrovnik, the last few days before the Second World War. The story revolves around three friends — Miho (a Jew), Niko (a Croat) and Toni (an Italian). They spend their days in each other's company - they're shown visiting a prostitute named Pina together, and later during practice at a fencing club. Toni is in a relationship with Niko's sister Ana, who intends to marry him. The engagement is interrupted by the noise of fighter jets and gunfire. Fascist and Nazi soldiers enter the city and occupy the entire area. Subsequently, Dubrovnik is annexed by the NDH and brought under a brutal dictatorship by the Ustashe, which divides the locals: Toni becomes a fascist, Miho is kicked out of his fencing club, while Niko and his father Baldo become anti-fascists and join the communist resistance. At a fascist celebration, Niko turns a picture of Mussolini upside down. By that point, Toni is a staunch anti-communist. In one raid, the Ustashe round up a dozen dissidents, mostly Jews and one Orthodox priest who preached in Russian, and take them by bus out of the city into the wilderness, slaughtering them. The bus driver, a Croat, calls the fascists freaks, whereupon they kill him too. Miho's father is also killed on the bus, and Miho, while the Ustashe are distracted by the bloodbath, jumps off the bus. Ana gets pregnant and marries Toni. Baldo is arrested for publicly expressing his contempt for the fascist movement, and dies in an attempt to escape deportation to a concentration camp. Toni moves into Niko's house, claiming that it is now his. Toni is about to leave the house together with Miho, who is hiding at his place. The three of them sing the song Drugovi stari (Old friends) for the last time. In the middle of the song, Niko shoots Toni. Ana enters and is shocked by the sight. Niko and Miho pack up and leave, joining the partisan movement.",

    "film_title": "Siberiade",
    "Synopsis": "The story revolves around two feuding families, the Solomins and the Ustyuzhanins, who live in Yelan. The Solomins were relatively wealthy and the Ustyuzhanins poor. The film begins in 1904. Afanasy \"Afonya\" Ustyuzhanin is an aging man who spends all of his waking hours chopping a corduroy road \"anywhere away from Yelan\". His seven-year-old son Nikolai \"Kolya\" Ustyuzhanin must fend for himself by stealing from the Solomins. He meets Rodion Klimentov, a revolutionary fugitive who inspires him, but is soon found by the police and taken away. In 1917, Kolya continues to help his father build the road, which has become an epic project stretching many miles. He is in a romantic relationship with a hoyden, Anastasia \"Nastya\" Solomina, but a quarrel about the revolution infuriates Nastya, who immediately seeks out Philip Solomin, kisses him, and demands marriage. (It is implied that Philip had previously had a non-reciprocated interest in her, and believes at first he is being mocked.) As the wedding preparations begin, Kolya begs for forgiveness, but Nastya savors the revenge. Kolya fights with the Solomins and is beaten and cast adrift down the river. At the end of the ceremony, Nastya makes a defiant gesture to Philip, apparently making clear that she will not be his either, despite having married him. He later finds her hiding in a barn; he fights and partially strips her, and then lets her go. She leaves to join an unconscious Kolya. Meanwhile Afonya (still chopping) has a problem with his heart, lies down on an ant nest, and dies alone. In 1932, Kolya returns to Yelan as a charismatic party official with his loyal, revolutionary-minded son Aleksei. He informs the Solomins that Nastya, who had left with him, died heroically. In a town hall meeting he gets the village to agree on a plan for tapping the area's natural resources. A dispute leads to Kolya arresting Spiridon Solomin, who soon escapes and kills Kolya. Aleksei flees. In June 1941, Aleksei, a teenager, returns to Yelan and meets Taya, at that point still a naïve girl; she becomes infatuated with him. A recruiting barge visits the town, announcing the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, and Aleksei enlists. The boat pulls away and Taya yells to Aleksei that she will wait for him all her life. In the war, Aleksei saves an injured officer (Philip, whom he does not know, or at least recognize) and becomes a decorated war hero. The war ends, and Taya continues to wait for Aleksei's return day after day, which never occurs. Around 1964, Aleksei returns to Yelan with an oil drilling crew. His uncle, Spiridon, has returned from prison a bitter and frail man, and Aleksei feels only pity. He meets Taya and has a casual affair, but she is also courted by Aleksei's boss Tofik, causing a rift. Meanwhile, Philip, who is in Moscow, has risen high into the ranks of Soviet leadership, but wrestles with his conscience over the plan for a massive hydroelectric dam project that would flood Yelan. Aleksei resigns from the oil drilling operation to leave town, stopping at Taya's house to take her with him to the resort city of Sochi, but it becomes clear that they have grown apart; she refuses to say whether the child she expects is Aleksei's or Tofik's. Aleksei storms off, and the oil well blows out as he leaves town. The blowout turns into an inferno and Aleksei rushes in to save a former coworker, and dies in the process. Spiridon gloats over the demise of the last Ustyuzhanin, but Taya reveals to him that she bears Aleksei's child. At a party conference in Moscow, a telegram arrives with the news of the oil strike, which vindicates Siberia as a mining center. The officials react with pleasure but give a moment of silence for the passing of Aleksei. Philip flies to Yelan to supervise the containment operation, but it becomes clear that the graveyard must be razed to save the town. As the film closes, the ghosts of the Solomins and Ustyuzhanins seemingly appear in the graveyard expressing gratitude and unity.",

Franck often drinks excessively and suffers from frequent mood swings and other symptoms of withdrawal. Looking for a man called Tikides who owes him money, he calls on the decrepit house of an old woman, who says he will find the man at the gym and agrees to buy a dressing gown. In return he can have sex with Mona, her underage niece, who leads him to her room and undresses. Though struck by the girl, Franck manages to restrain himself and leave. Going home, he falls into another argument with his wife, in which he pushes her dressed into the bath full of water, and she leaves. His boss, aware that Franck has been cheating him for some time, has him arrested and held at the police station. Freed next day when a young woman pays the debt in full, he discovers it was not his wife but Mona. Going round to thank her, he asks where she got the money and she says she took it from her aunt's hidden cash hoard. When he suggests to Mona that the two of them could lift the hoard and disappear together, she agrees but warns him that the aunt also has a hidden pistol. He then enlists Tikides as his accomplice, telling him to wait in the car while he deals with the aunt. After killing her and finding the pistol, he calls Tikides in and shoots him dead. Leaving Mona to explain to the police that the intruder killed the old woman who had wounded him fatally, Franck goes home with the money. There he finds his wife has returned, pregnant and eager to start afresh. When she finds the money and reads about the case in the newspapers, she accuses Franck. To silence her, he kills her. His boss then comes round, also having concluded that Franck is the culprit, and demands all the loot. By now Franck has stopped caring and hands it over.

    "Synopsis": "Four young siblings: Charlotte, Branwell, Emily and Anne, live a stoic existence in a small village in the English country side. Their old father, an Anglican minister, a rigid spinster aunt and Tabby, the maid, complete their household. The siblings have artistic ambitions and rely upon each other for companionship. Branwell is a painter and a self-portrait with his sisters is worthy of the general admiration of the family. He wants to pursue a professional career, but only goes as far as to establish a friendship with Leyland, a sculptor. Emily's favorite pastime is to walk across the bleak moors that surround the village dressed as a man. Anne, the youngest of the siblings, is her companion. Charlotte, more ambitious than the others, convinces their reluctant aunt to give her money to go to Belgium in order to study French. Her idea is to eventually come back and open a school. With their aunt's money and permission, Charlotte and Emily go to Brussels. Once there, Charlotte falls secretly in love with her teacher Monsieur Heger, who is already married. Emily plays the piano at school, but has a hard time there and is teased by her classmates for being English and Protestant in a Catholic country. Meanwhile, in England, Anne finds employment as a governess, taking over the education of the daughter of a wealthy family. While his sisters are away, Branwell deals alone with the death of their aunt. Her death makes Emily and Charlotte come back home. Emily is relieved and helps Branwell to find solace, taking him to the Black Bull Inn, the tavern and hotel of the town. Charlotte, on the other hand, lovesick, returns as soon as possible to Brussels to be reunited with Monsieur Heger, but her love is unrequited. Thanks to Anne, the aimless dreamer Branwell finds a steady job as the teacher of Edmund, the young son of the Robinson family, Anne's wealthy employers. Mr Robinson is strict, and, with his air of superiority, humiliates both Anne and Branwell. Mrs Robinson, flirty and unsatisfied, starts an ill-fated affair with Branwell. When Anne finds out about their relationship, she quits her job and returns home. Both Branwell and Charlotte have to deal with their broken hearts. After the death of her husband, Mrs Robinson sends Branwell a letter ending their affair. Branwell's life takes a dark turn. He gives himself over to drinking and becomes addicted to opium. During a windy night, a fire starts in his bedroom and he has to be rescued from amongst the flames by his sisters. Sneaking into Emily's bedroom and searching amongst her things, Charlotte discovers Emily's poems. Deeply impressed, she finally is able to convince the reluctant Emily to have them published. Soon the three sisters have their poems, and later a novel each, published. Reviews of Emily's novel, Wuthering Heights, are particularly harsh. However, the novels of Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell, the pen names adopted by the three sisters, are the talk of London literary circles. Speculations about the sex and identity of the Bells force Charlotte and Anne to go to London to introduce themselves to George Smith, Charlotte's publisher. Unaware of his sisters literary accomplishments, Branwell dies of marasmus exacerbated by heavy drinking. Emily, stricken by tuberculosis, refuses all medical treatment, insisting on carrying on with her household chores. When she finally agrees to send for a doctor, it is too late, and she dies. Anne is also terminally ill with tuberculosis. Following her wishes, Charlotte takes her to see the ocean for the first time, and Anne dies during that trip. Charlotte is the only survivor among the four siblings. Left alone with her elderly father, she pursues her literary career and begins a romantic relationship with Arthur Nicholls, her father's curate. In the company of Mr. Nicholls and her publisher, Mr Smith, Charlotte goes to the opera in London and meets the famous author William Thackeray.",

    "film_title": "The China Syndrome",
    "Synopsis": "While visiting the Ventana nuclear power plant outside Los Angeles, television news reporter Kimberly Wells, her cameraman Richard Adams and their soundman Hector Salas witness the plant going through a turbine trip and corresponding SCRAM (emergency shutdown). Shift Supervisor Jack Godell notices an unusual vibration in his cup of coffee. In response to a gauge indicating high water levels, Godell begins removing water from the core, but the gauge remains high as operators open more valves to dump water. Another operator notices a second gauge indicating low water levels. Godell taps the first gauge, which immediately unsticks and drops to indicate very low levels. The crew urgently pumps water back in and celebrates in relief at bringing the reactor back under control. Adams has surreptitiously filmed the incident, despite being asked not to film for security reasons. Wells' superior refuses to broadcast her report on the incident. Adams steals the footage and shows it to experts who conclude that the plant came perilously close to meltdown – the China syndrome. During an inspection of the plant before it is brought back online, Godell discovers a puddle of radioactive water that has apparently leaked from a pump. He pushes to delay restarting the plant, but the plant superintendent wants nothing standing in the way of the restart. Godell finds that a series of radiographs supposedly verifying the welds on the leaking pump are identical – the contractor simply kept resubmitting the same picture. He brings the evidence to the plant superintendent, who brushes him off as paranoid, stating that new radiographs would cost $20 million. Godell confronts Royce, an employee of Foster-Sullivan who built the plant, as it was he who signed off on the radiographs. Godell threatens to go to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but Royce threatens him; later, a pair of men from Foster-Sullivan park outside his house. Wells and Adams confront Godell at his home and he voices his concerns. Wells and Adams ask him to testify at the NRC hearings over Foster-Sullivan's plans to build another nuclear plant. Godell agrees to obtain, through Salas, the false radiographs to take to the hearings. Salas' car is run off the road and the radiographs are taken from him. Godell is chased by the men waiting outside his home. He takes refuge inside the plant, where he finds that the reactor is being brought up to full power. Grabbing a gun from a security guard, he forces everyone out, including his friend and co-worker Ted Spindler, and demands to be interviewed by Wells on live television. Plant management agrees to the interview in order to buy time as they try to regain control of the plant. Minutes into the broadcast, plant technicians deliberately cause a SCRAM so they can distract Godell and retake the control room. A SWAT team forces its way in, the television cable is cut, and Godell is shot. Before dying, he feels the unusual vibration again. The resulting SCRAM is brought under control only by the plant's automatic systems, and the plant suffers significant damage as the pump malfunctions. Plant officials try to paint Godell as emotionally disturbed, but are contradicted by a distraught Spindler on live television saying Godell was not crazy and would never have taken such drastic steps had there not been something wrong. A tearful Wells concludes her report and the news cuts to a commercial for microwave ovens.",

    "Synopsis": "The Wentworths are a prosperous family living in an estate in a suburb of Boston in the 1850s. The family consists of the dour father, Mr. Wentworth, and his three adult children: Gertrude, Charlotte, and Clifford. Their quiet existence is shaken by the unexpected arrival of almost forgotten relatives from Europe. The Europeans are Felix Young and his older sister Eugenia Münster who are cultured, witty and broke. Felix is interested in painting while Eugenia, sophisticated and alluring, is a baroness as the morganatic wife of a minor German prince. On his arrival at the Wentworths' state, Felix first meets Gertrude, the nonconformist Wentworth daughter, who is shirking attendance at church and reading romantic literature instead. After introducing himself, he stays over for dinner while she is soon intrigued and enchanted by her cousin. The next day Eugenia pays them a visit and meets not only the four Wentworths but also Robert Acton and his sister Lizzie who are the Wentworths' cousins by another side of their family. Eugenia drops backhanded compliments to the befuddled silence of the modest, straightlaced Wentworths. Robert and his sister are cautious and suspicious of Eugenia’s intentions. After Felix and Eugenia have left, the family debates what to do. Since they are relatives, Mr. Wentworth puts them up in a neighboring cottage on his property. Felix installs his art studio there and suggests making a portrait of his uncle. Mr. Wentworth declines, but Felix continues to paint Gertrude. Felix wonders why his American relatives seem so little concerned for the pleasures of life, living by strict standards, seeming not to think of their own individual happiness. Eugenia sets her eyes on the Wentworths’ wealthy cousin Robert Acton, who is torn between captivation by the Baroness and distrust of her European worldliness. Eugenia refers little to her marriage other than telling him she has a paper the husband's family wishes her to sign which would dissolve the marriage. During a ball at the Actons’ house, Eugenia is introduced to Robert's ailing mother whom she manages to charm. At the ball, Clifford has too much to drink. When Mr. Wentworth complains about it to Felix, he suggests that his sister’s influence might help the wayward youngster to improve his behaviour, and indeed, Clifford begins visiting Eugenia. Meanwhile, Felix and Gertrude are falling in love. Gertrude tells him her father wants her to marry the Unitarian minister, Mr. Brand, though she doesn't love him. Felix, noticing that Gertrude's pliable sister, Charlotte, seems attracted to the minister, speaks to Mr. Brand, redirecting Brand’s feelings away from Gertrude and towards Charlotte instead. One late evening, Robert Acton, who has been away for a few days (and is beginning to believe he is in love with Eugenia), goes to visit her. Clifford has been enjoying an intimate and promising evening with Eugenia; she makes him hide in a back room. When Clifford comes unexpectedly out of his hiding place, there is a very awkward moment. Clifford leaves and Eugenia lies about why the young man was at her home. Later, in talking with Clifford, Mr. Acton realises she had not told the truth. Eugenia's lies begin to weigh upon his thoughts, and he loses interest as Lizzie outflanks the baroness in her attempt to win her brother. Meanwhile, Felix tells his sister he wants to marry Gertrude; Eugenia lies to him, claiming Robert Acton asked to marry her, but she is not sure she wants to. Felix makes a visit to his uncle and asks for Gertrude's hand. Mr. Wentworth is bewildered at first, but his other daughter, Charlotte, speaks in favour of the match, then Gertrude comes in and declares she will marry Felix, and finally Mr. Brand comes in to say he would like to marry the young couple. Understanding that her goal of finding a wealthy man in the United States has failed, Eugenia decides to go back to Germany. She makes a farewell visit to Mrs. Acton, sees Robert as she is leaving and lies to him claiming to have sent the annulation papers to Germany. Mr. Acton expresses regret that she has decided to leave and offers his carriage to Eugenia for her use at her departure. Felix will marry Gertrude. Clifford will be paired with Lizzie Acton. Mr. Brand and Charlotte plan to marry, far more suited to one another than Gertrude was to Mr. Brand. The final scene shows all of the paired lovers - Felix and Gertrude, Mr. Brand and Charlotte, Lizzy and Clifford - walking together to various destinations, while Eugenia, having availed herself of Acton's offer of his carriage to take her to the boat, travels alone one way, and Acton, on horseback, rides alone the other way.",

    "film_title": "The Tin Drum (film)",
    "Synopsis": "The film centers on Oskar Matzerath, a boy born and raised in the Free City of Danzig prior to and during World War II, who recalls the story's events as an unreliable narrator. Oskar is the son of a half-Polish Kashubian woman, Agnes Bronski, who is married to a German chef named Alfred Matzerath. Agnes secretly carries on an affair with Jan, a Polish Post Office worker and her cousin. Alfred and Jan are friends, and Alfred mostly acts willfully ignorant of his wife's infidelity. Oskar's parentage is uncertain, though he believes he is Jan's son. The film begins with Agnes' conception by Joseph Kolaizcek, a petty criminal in rural Kashubia (located in modern-day Poland). He hides underneath the skirts of a young woman named Anna Bronski and has sex with her, and she tries to hide her emotions as the troops searching for him pass close by. She later gives birth to Agnes. Joseph evades the authorities for a year, but when they find him again, he jumps into a lake and is never seen again. Oskar speculates that he either drowned or escaped to America and became a millionaire. In 1927, on Oskar's third birthday, he is given a tin drum. Reflecting on the foolish antics of his drunken parents and friends, he resolves to stop growing and throws himself down the cellar stairs. From that day on, he does not grow at all. Oskar discovers he can shatter glass with his voice, an ability he often uses when he is upset. On one occasion, he uses his drumming to cause the attendants of a Nazi rally to start dancing a waltz. During a visit to the circus, Oskar befriends Bebra, a performing dwarf who chose to stop growing at age ten. When Alfred, Agnes, Jan, and Oskar are on an outing to the beach, they see an eel-picker collecting eels from a horse's head used as bait. The sight makes Agnes vomit repeatedly. Alfred buys some of the eels and prepares them for dinner that night. When he insists that Agnes eat them, she becomes distraught and retreats to the bedroom. Jan enters and comforts her, all within earshot of Oskar, who is hiding in the closet. She calmly returns to the dinner table and eats the eels. Over the next few days, she binges on fish. Oskar's grandmother helps reveal that Agnes is worried her pregnancy is due to her relations with Jan. In anger, Agnes vows that the child will never be born. She dies shortly thereafter, seemingly from accumulated stress. At the funeral, Oskar encounters Sigismund Markus, the kindly Jewish toy seller who supplies him with replacement drums, and who was also in love with Agnes. Markus is ordered by two of the mourners to leave because he is Jewish; Nazism is on the rise, and the Jewish and Polish residents of Danzig are under increasing pressure. Markus later commits suicide after his shop is vandalized and a synagogue is burned down by SA men. On 1 September 1939, Oskar and Jan go looking for Kobyella, who can repair Oskar's drum. Jan slips into the Polish Post Office, despite a Nazi cordon, and participates in an armed standoff against the Nazis. During the ensuing battle, Kobyella is fatally shot, and Jan is wounded. They play Skat until Kobyella dies, and the Germans capture the building. Oskar is taken home, while Jan is arrested and later executed. Alfred hires Maria, a sixteen-year-old German girl, to work in his shop, and Oskar seduces her. When he later discovers Alfred having sex with her, he bursts into the room and makes Alfred ejaculate inside her (when he was expected to pull out, to avoid getting her pregnant), causing Maria to become angry at Alfred when he blames Oskar for the inadvertent insemination. While rinsing her vagina in an attempt to remove the deposited semen, Maria and Oskar fight, and he hits her in the groin. She later gives birth to a son, who Oskar is convinced is his. Oskar also has a brief sexual relationship with Lina Greff, the wife of the local grocer and scoutmaster. It is implied that Lina was sexually frustrated, as her husband preferred to spend more time with the Hitler Youth boys. Lina's husband later commits suicide after a neighbor catches him \"playing\" with those boys and reports him to the Nazi authorities. During World War II, Oskar meets Bebra and Roswitha, another dwarf performer in Bebra's successful troupe. Oskar decides to join them, using his glass-shattering voice as part of the act. Oskar and Roswitha have an affair, but she is killed by artillery fire during the Allied invasion of Normandy while they are on tour. Oskar returns home. Much of Danzig has been destroyed, and the Russians are fast approaching. He gives Maria's three-year-old son Kurt a tin drum like his own. Some Russian soldiers break into the cellar where Oskar's family and Lina are hiding. They gang-rape Lina, and Alfred is killed by a soldier after he swallows and chokes violently on his Nazi party pin, apparently betrayed by Oskar. Alfred's shop is taken over by Mariusz Fajngold, a Jewish survivor of Treblinka, who arranges a modest funeral for Alfred. During Alfred's burial, Oskar decides to grow up and throws his drum into the grave. As he does, Kurt throws a stone at his head, causing Oskar to fall into the grave as well. Afterwards, an attendee announces that Oskar is growing again, though he is severely injured. Oskar, Maria, and Kurt leave for Germany, but his grandmother stays in Poland.",

As one of these experiments, the Doctor tells Woyzeck he must eat nothing but peas. Woyzeck's mental health is breaking down and he begins to experience a series of apocalyptic visions.

Woyzeck disposes of the knife in the pond, and while trying to wash the blood off, he hallucinates that he is swimming in blood and apparently drowns himself and dies.

    "Synopsis": "Joe Gideon is a theater director and choreographer attempting to balance staging his latest Broadway musical, NY/LA, while editing a Hollywood film he has directed, The Stand-Up. He is an alcoholic, a driven workaholic who chain-smokes cigarettes, and a womanizer constantly flirting and engaging in sexual encounters with a stream of women. Each morning, he begins his day by playing a tape of Vivaldi while taking doses of Visine, Alka-Seltzer, and Dexedrine, always concluding by looking at himself in the mirror and saying, \"It's showtime, folks!\" Joe's ex-wife, Audrey Paris, is involved with the production of the show but disapproves of his womanizing ways. Meanwhile, his girlfriend Katie Jagger and daughter Michelle keep him company. In his imagination, he flirts with an angel of death named Angelique in a nightclub setting, discussing his life with her. As Joe continues to be dissatisfied with his editing job, repeatedly making minor changes to a single monologue, he vents his anger on the dancers and in his choreography. This leads to a highly sexualized number of topless women during a rehearsal, frustrating the show's penny-pinching backers. One of the few moments of joy in his life occurs when Katie and Michelle perform a Fosse-style number for Joe as an homage to the upcoming release of The Stand-Up, moving him to tears. During a table-read of NY/LA, Joe experiences severe chest pains and is admitted to the hospital with severe angina. Joe brushes off his symptoms, attempting to leave for rehearsal, but he collapses in the doctor's office and is ordered to stay in the hospital for several weeks to rest his heart and recover from exhaustion. NY/LA is postponed, but Gideon continues his antics from the hospital bed, smoking and drinking while hosting endless streams of women in his room. As he does, his condition continues to deteriorate, despite Audrey and Katie remaining by his side for support. A negative review for The Stand-Up, released during Joe's hospitalization, comes in despite the film's financial success, and Gideon has a massive coronary event. While Joe undergoes coronary artery bypass surgery, the producers of NY/LA realize that the best way to recoup their money and make a profit is to bet on Gideon's death: the insurance proceeds would result in a profit of over half a million dollars. As Gideon goes on life support, he directs extravagant musical dream sequences in his head starring his daughter, wife, and girlfriend, all berating him for his behavior. He realizes he cannot avoid his death and has another heart attack. As the doctors try to save him, Joe runs away from his hospital bed behind their backs, exploring the basement of the hospital and the autopsy ward before allowing himself to be taken back. He goes through the five stages of grief—anger, denial, bargaining, depression, and acceptance—featured in the stand-up routine he had been editing. As he gets closer to death, his dream sequences become more and more hallucinatory. As the doctors try one more time to save him, Joe imagines a monumental variety show featuring everyone from his past where he takes center stage in an extensive musical number (\"Bye Bye Life\", a whimsical parody of \"Bye Bye Love\"). In his dying dream, Joe can thank his family and acquaintances, as he cannot from his hospital bed, and his performance receives a massive standing ovation. Joe finally dreams of himself traveling down a hallway to meet Angelique at the end. Meanwhile, his corpse is zipped up in a body bag.",

    "Synopsis": "<!--- DO NOT ADD BEYOND 700 WORDS; PLOTS ARE GENERALLY 400-700 WORDS; CURRENT COUNT: 700 --> Middle-aged, simple-minded Chance lives in a wealthy old man's townhouse in Washington, D.C., along with the man's African-American maid Louise, who is kind to Chance. He has spent his whole life tending the garden and never left the property. Other than gardening, his knowledge is derived entirely from television. When the old man dies, his estate lawyers order Chance out. He wanders aimlessly, discovering the outside world for the first time. An African-American youth points a knife at him; Chance ineffectually tries to click him out of existence with a TV remote control. Passing by a TV shop, Chance sees himself captured by a video camera in the shop window. Entranced, he steps backward off the sidewalk and is struck by a limousine chauffeuring Eve Rand, the glamorous and much younger wife of elderly business mogul Ben Rand. When she asks him his name she mishears \"Chance, the gardener\" as \"Chauncey Gardiner\". Eve brings Chance to their palatial estate to be seen by Dr. Allenby, who is resident there caring for Ben, who is slowly dying from a blood disease. After checking Chauncey out, the doctor invites him to stay to keep an eye on him. Chauncey's manners are old-fashioned and courtly, and he wears expensively-tailored but outmoded 1930s clothes he took from his former employer's attic. When Ben meets him he takes \"Chauncey\" for an upper-class, highly educated businessman fallen on hard times. Ben admires him, finding him direct, wise and insightful. Ben is also a confidant and advisor to the President of the United States, whom he introduces to Chauncey. In a discussion about the economy, Chance takes his cue from the words \"stimulate growth\" and talks about the changing seasons of the garden. The President misinterprets this as optimistic political advice and quotes \"Chauncey Gardiner\" in a speech. Chance now rises to national prominence, attends important events, develops a close connection with the Soviet ambassador, and appears on a talk show during which his detailed advice about what a serious gardener should do is misunderstood as his opinion on presidential policy. Louise tells other African Americans as they watch Chance on TV that he has \"rice pudding between the ears\" and that whiteness is all that is needed to succeed in America. The President is shown as sexually impotent with his wife when watching the show. Though Chance has now risen to the pinnacle of Washington society, the Secret Service and 16 foreign agencies are unable to find any background information on him. Meanwhile, Allenby becomes increasingly suspicious that Chance is not a wise political expert and that his mysterious identity may have a more mundane explanation. Allenby considers telling Ben, but remains silent when he realizes how happy Chance is making him in his final days. The dying Ben encourages Eve to become close to \"Chauncey\". She is already attracted to him and makes a sexual advance. Chance has no interest in or knowledge of sex, but mimics a kissing scene from the 1968 film The Thomas Crown Affair, which happens to be on TV. When the scene ends, Chance stops suddenly and Eve is confused. She asks what he likes, meaning sexually; he replies \"I like to watch,\" meaning television. She is momentarily taken aback, but masturbates for his voyeuristic pleasure, not noticing he has turned back to the TV and is imitating Lilias, Yoga and You on another channel. Chance is present at Ben's death and shows genuine sadness. Questioned by Allenby, he admits that he \"loves Eve very much\" and also that he is just a gardener. When he leaves to inform Eve of Ben's death, Allenby says to himself, \"I understand.\" While the President delivers a speech at Ben's funeral, the pallbearers hold a whispered discussion over potential replacements for the President in the next presidential term, and unanimously agree on \"Chauncey\" as successor. Oblivious, Chance wanders off through Ben's wintry estate. He straightens out a pine sapling flattened by a fallen branch, then walks across the surface of a lake without sinking. He pauses, dips his umbrella deep into the water to the right of his path, then continues on, while the President is heard quoting Ben: \"Life is a state of mind.\"",

    "film_title": "Breaker Morant (film)",
    "Synopsis": "In 1902, three Australian soldiers are tried for war crimes committed during the Second Boer War in South Africa. Lieutenants Harry \"Breaker\" Morant, Peter Handcock and George Witton; all officers of the elite Bushveldt Carbineers, are charged with the murder of one Boer prisoner (Floris Visser), the subsequent murders of six more; Morant and Handcock are accused of the sniper-style death of a German missionary, the Rev. Hesse. Their counsel, Major Thomas, has had only one day to prepare their defense. Lord Kitchener, who ordered the trial, hopes to bring the Boer War to an end with a peace conference. To that end, he uses the Morant trial to show that he is willing to judge his own soldiers harshly if they disobey the rules of war. Though there are great complexities associated with charging active-duty soldiers with murder, Kitchener is determined to have a guilty verdict, and the chief of the court supports him. The causes and occurrences relating to the trial are developed. Morant's execution of the Boer prisoners was revenge for the mutilation and death of his friend and commanding officer, Captain Hunt. Angered by the incident, Morant led an attack on a Boer camp, where a Boer wearing Hunt's khaki jacket was captured. Morant had him executed. The killing of six prisoners was in much the same fashion. Morant later justifies their deaths, saying, \"You know the orders from Whitehall. If they show a white flag, we don't see it. I didn't see it.\" Before their execution, Morant notices Hesse speaking with the prisoners. Morant, furious, is convinced that Hesse is a spy, though he has no proof. A conversation with Handcock leads to the latter taking a rifle and horse and following Hesse, who is found shot the next morning. During the trial, the court's bias toward a guilty verdict becomes apparent, as well as the political machinations behind it. The focus is on whether or not orders were issued by Kitchener to shoot all Boer prisoners; Thomas' case is that there were standing, though unwritten, orders to do so. Since these were verbally relayed to Hunt, and by Hunt to Morant, there is no way to prove that the orders existed. Ironically, it transpires that while Morant acted under orders by shooting the prisoners, he and Handcock were in fact responsible for the murder of Hesse. Handcock, who took care to set up an alibi with two \"ladyfriends,\" admits to Witton that he actually followed Hesse and shot him. However, the court acquits them of the murder of Hesse but finds them guilty of the other two charges. Kitchener is conveniently absent and therefore unavailable for pleas for a reprieve, though he does commute Witton's sentence to life imprisonment before leaving. Morant and Handcock are shot in the morning as Witton is taken to the prison transport. As a final insult Handcock's coffin is built too small for his tall frame, and the soldiers are forced to clumsily cram his body in. A summary at the end of the movie reveals what happens to some of the characters. Thomas returns to his native Australia and continues his law practice, which is otherwise confined to estate planning and wills. Witton serves three years of his sentence, but is released after a national outcry and writes a book entitled Scapegoats of the Empire, an account of the Morant affair. This proves so inflammatory and anti-British that it is suppressed during the World Wars.",

    "Synopsis": "The \"Caravana Rolidei\" (Holiday Caravan) is a traveling show made up of a magician, Lorde Cigano (Gypsy Lord), exotic dancer Salomé, and the mute strongman Andorinha (Swallow). The caravan drives their van up and performs in small towns along the São Francisco river. Afterwards a local accordion player, Ciço, begs Lorde Cigano to let him join them. He agrees, and Ciço joins the caravan together with his pregnant wife Dasdô. They then go to Maceió to see the ocean, but completely fail to find any business. They arrive at the next town only to find everyone watching the new invention, television, in a public area, since at first, in poor areas, television was too expensive for people to have it in their homes. After attempting and failing to convince the audience to stop watching, Lorde Cigano pretends to use magic to blow up the TV (it's actually just Salomé overloading a circuit breaker ). The townspeople then force them to leave. At a gas station, Swallow arm-wrestles a truck driver for money as part of a bet. After losing multiple times, he tells Lorde Cigano that he has come from Altamira, which he describes as a new El Dorado, a place of riches where no one can spend their money. Driving into a small town, they learn from another traveling performer who screens films, during a screening of O Ébrio, that the town has not received rain in over two years. The traveling performer tells the group that the community has no money, and that they pay to watch his films with food, drink, and other odd possessions. As the sun sets, Ciço enters Salomé's tent with lust in his eyes. Salomé proceeds to put on her record player and the two have sex. Dasdô is aware of the whole encounter, and while she is clearly not pleased with Ciço, she doesn't seem very upset either. Lorde Cigano then decides to take the group to Altamira. On the drive, Dasdô gives birth, as the group navigates through dense jungle along a long, straight dirt road, littered with dead trees and an armadillo. The caravan finds a group of indigenous people who ask for a ride to Altamira. They cannot make a living in the jungle anymore because of the white men bringing change and death. Lorde Cigano agrees to take them for a price. Upon arriving at Altamira, they find that the city is actually highly developed and is not rural like they previously believed. Attempting to earn money, Lorde Cigano has Swallow wrestle another strongman, betting the caravan's truck. Losing the bet and their means of transport, Lorde Cigano asks Salomé to temporarily prostitute herself, so they can afford to leave Altamira. That night, Swallow leaves the group, and Lorde Cigano has sex with Dasdô. The next morning, Salomé comes back with money. Lorde Cigano splits the money, and tells Ciço to leave with Dasdô. He refuses to leave, after which Lorde Cigano explicitly tells him they are going to a whorehouse. Ciço volunteers Dasdô to work in the whorehouse without so much as asking her, and Lorde Cigano tells him he will have to tell his wife. Upon arriving in the next town and ending up at a bar, a man tries to go out with Dasdô. Ciço stops him, and pushes him away. Salomé ends up going and having sex with the man, and Ciço states that he will take the bus to Brasília with Dasdô. The next morning however, he is outside Lorde Cigano and Salomé's hotel room. He states that he won't go to Brasília, and confesses his eternal love for Salomé. Lorde Cigano, however, finally loses his patience with Ciço, and punches him multiple times, knocking him out, and wheels him out and onto the bus. Ciço and Dasdô end up taking the bus down to a small home in Brasília. Some time later, Ciço and Dasdô are performing onstage in a small club with a band, with their child playing in the band. Ciço hears the sound of a loudspeaker, and goes outside to see a much more modern truck with neon lights, the new \"Caravana Rolidey\", driven by Salomé with Lorde Cigano in the passenger seat. He asks Ciço and Dasdô to rejoin them, and tells him that they are going inland to bring civilization, telling them that the innermost area has never seen anything like them. Ciço declines, however, and Lorde Cigano returns to the van, as he and Salomé drive off along the highway.",

    "Synopsis": "The prologue introduces Paul Godard, a filmmaker, and his estranged girlfriend, Denise, in which a stressed Paul leaves the deluxe hotel to which he has moved and rebuffs the sexual advances of a male hotel attendant. The first section, \"The Imaginary,\" follows Denise as she takes her first steps to an independent life without Paul. She lands a manual job on a local paper run by an old friend, perhaps an old lover, in a country town and gets a room on a farm in return for helping with the cattle. She is also writing up some new project, which may become a novel. At the same time, she has to complete her job at the television station where she and Paul work, as well as find a new tenant for her flat in the city where she and Paul have been living together. Realising she is late to collect the author and filmmaker Marguerite Duras for an interview, she telephones Paul to ask if he can do it for her. Despite being in no mood to agree with her, he accepts. The second section, \"Fear,\" focuses on Paul. He is afraid of life without Denise, perhaps of life itself. After picking up his surly daughter Cécile from soccer practice, at which seemingly apropos of nothing he asks the coach if he has ever felt like touching or having sex with his own daughter, he fulfils his favour to Denise by collecting Marguerite Duras from a local college, where she was due to give a talk. When she refuses to do so (her voice is heard but she is not shown), Paul reads out some of her notes, in which she says that she only makes films because she lacks the courage to do nothing. Paul says this is true for himself as well. The celebrity then gets Paul to take her back to the airport, after which he has to face a furious Denise who has lost her interviewee. That evening, as it is Cécile's birthday, he takes her and her mother to a restaurant but all his scornful ex-wife wants is money and all the girl wants is presents. Leaving in fury, after again expressing his alienation with inappropriate sexual innuendo, he meets Denise in a bar, where the two quarrel and part. Standing alone in a late-night cinema queue, he is picked up by the prostitute Isabelle. Part Three, \"Commerce,\" is Isabelle's section, in which she devotes herself to increasing her earnings in order to achieve independence. After her night with Paul, in which she mechanically goes through the motions while mentally planning her next day, she is waylaid by a pimp who gives her a spanking to remind her that there is no independence in a commercial world and he must have 50% of her earnings. On returning to the apartment she shares with some other women, who all seem to detest her, her younger sister arrives unexpectedly and asks Isabelle for money because her lover and all his associates have just been jailed for robbing a jeweler. When Isabelle refuses, the sister asks if she will get her started in the local prostitution business. Isabelle agrees to coach her for a month, in exchange for 50% of the take. While continuing to service a variety of clients with different needs, sometimes inventive (one businessman choreographs a foursome while sitting at his desk), and all the while with her mind elsewhere, she is also searching for an apartment of her own. An old school friend she meets in a hotel corridor, probably a dealer and maybe a prostitute as well, offers her a lucrative opportunity to be a courier, but the boss of the operation finds Isabelle too dangerously naive. Going to inspect an apartment, it turns out to be that of Denise, and Paul is also there trying to rekindle the relationship. Isabelle and Denise form an immediate bond. In the coda, entitled \"Music,\" Isabelle seems to prosper in her new apartment and Denise has moved on in life. After having spent several days adrift, Paul runs into his ex-wife and daughter and asks plaintively to spend more time with them. Walking backwards away from the two, Paul accidentally steps in front of a car and is hit. Isabelle's sister, now apparently a prostitute, flees the scene with the driver of the car, her client. Paul's ex-wife also urges Cécile to come away, saying \"it's nothing to do with us.\" As the two walk off, they pass a small orchestra set up in a garage yard that is playing the theme music which has echoed through the film.",

    "Synopsis": "During the Sengoku period, in 1571, Takeda Shingen, daimyō of Kai province from the Takeda clan, meets a thief his brother Nobukado has spared from crucifixion due to the thief's uncanny resemblance to Shingen. The brothers agree that he would prove useful as a double, and they decide to use the thief as a kagemusha, a political decoy. Later, while the Takeda army lays siege to a castle belonging to Tokugawa Ieyasu, Shingen is shot while listening to a flute playing in the enemy camp. He orders his forces to withdraw and, before succumbing to his wound, commands his generals to keep his death a secret for three years. Meanwhile, Shingen's rivals Oda Nobunaga, Tokugawa Ieyasu, and Uesugi Kenshin puzzle over the reason for Shingen's withdrawal, unaware of his death. Nobukado presents the thief to Shingen's generals, proposing to have him impersonate Shingen full-time. Although the thief is unaware of Shingen's death initially, he eventually finds Shingen's preserved corpse in a large jar, having believed it to contain treasure. The generals then decide they cannot trust the thief and release him. Later, the jar is dropped into Lake Suwa, which spies working for the Tokugawa and Oda forces witness. Suspecting that Shingen has died, the spies go to report their observation, but the thief, having overheard the spies, returns to the Takeda forces and offers to work as a kagemusha. The Takeda clan preserves the deception by announcing that they were simply making an offering of sake to the god of the lake, and the spies are ultimately convinced by the thief's performance. Returning home, the kagemusha convinces Shingen's retinue by imitating the late warlord's gestures and learning more about him. When the kagemusha must preside over a clan meeting, he is instructed by Nobukado to remain silent until Nobukado brings the generals to a consensus, whereupon the kagemusha will simply agree with the generals' plan and dismiss the council. However, Shingen's son Katsuyori is incensed by his father's decree of the three year subterfuge, which delays his inheritance and leadership of the clan. Katsuyori thus decides to test the kagemusha in front of the council, as the majority of the attendants are still unaware of Shingen's death. He directly asks the kagemusha what course of action should be taken, but the kagemusha is able to answer convincingly in Shingen's own manner, which further convinces the generals. In 1573, Nobunaga mobilizes his forces to attack Azai Nagamasa, continuing his campaign in central Honshu to maintain his control of Kyoto against the growing opposition. When the Tokugawa and Oda forces launch an attack against the Takeda, Katsuyori begins a counter-offensive against the advice of his generals. The kagemusha is then forced to lead reinforcements in the Battle of Takatenjin, and he helps inspire the troops to victory. However, in a later fit of overconfidence, the kagemusha attempts to ride Shingen's notoriously temperamental horse, and falls off. When those who rush to help him see that he does not have Shingen's battle scars, he is revealed as an impostor, and is driven out in disgrace, allowing Katsuyori to take over the clan. Sensing weakness in the Takeda clan leadership, the Oda and Tokugawa forces are emboldened to begin a full-scale offensive into the Takeda homeland. By 1575, now in full control of the Takeda army, Katsuyori leads a counter-offensive against Nobunaga in Nagashino. Although courageous in their assault, several waves of Takeda cavalry and infantry are cut down by volleys of gunfire from Oda arquebusiers deployed behind wooden stockades, effectively eliminating the Takeda army. The kagemusha, who has followed the Takeda army, desperately takes up a spear and charges toward the Oda lines before being shot himself. Mortally wounded, the kagemusha attempts to retrieve the fūrinkazan banner, which had fallen into a river, but succumbs to his wounds and is carried away by the current.",

The first episode tells of Enrico, an uninspired screenwriter who ends up in the throes of a very heavy nervous breakdown; the second episode tells of Luigi, an out-of-fashion, pleasure-seeking, womanizing journalist who tries to win back his wife, a politically engaged journalist who is twenty years his junior, and actively pursuing feminist causes; the third episode tells of Sergio, an anorexic and clinically depressed RAI official; the fourth episode tells of Amedeo, a successful film producer struggling with the artistic ambitions of his wife, who in fact endorses the career of a haughty director of scabrous arthouse films, and with which he no longer has any relationship despite his efforts to rekindle; the last episode tells of Mario, a deputy of the Italian Communist Party, facing a strong existential crisis who finds himself cultivating an adulterous relationship. At the end of these five stories, the film closes with a new meeting on that same terrace, which takes place a year later.",

    "Synopsis": "Henri Laborit gives an introduction to the physiology of the brain, and also briefly describes his own background. Summary biographies of three fictional characters are given in parallel to his own: Jean Le Gall is born into a comfortable middle-class family on an island in the gulf of Morbihan in Brittany and pursues a career in radio and politics; Janine Garnier, daughter of left-wing working-class parents in Paris, runs away from home to become an actress, but later switches career to be a fashion adviser; René Ragueneau rebels against the old-fashioned outlook of his farming family in Torfou, in Maine-et-Loire, and studies accountancy before becoming an executive in a textile factory in Lille; a company merger forces him to take a new job in Cholet, away from his wife and children. Laborit expounds his ideas on four main types of animal behaviour, grounded respectively in consumption, escape, struggle, and inhibition. The lives of the three fictional characters intersect at various points (Jean in an affair with Janine, René negotiating with Janine about the future of his job) and each of them faces moments of critical life-changing decision. At these moments they are seen as self-identifying with the image of a popular star in French cinema (Jean with Danielle Darrieux, Janine with Jean Marais, and René with Jean Gabin). Laborit comments on the conflicts arising from pursuit of dominance among individuals and defensive reactions to it, and reflects on the need for better understanding of the human brain.",

    "Synopsis": "Cindy \"Cebe\" Barnes is a rebellious adolescent tomboy being raised by her heroin-addicted mother, Kathy, in rural British Columbia. Cebe's father, Don, an abusive alcoholic, is serving a prison sentence for a road accident in which he drunkenly crashed his semi-truck into a school bus, killing all of the school children on board; Cebe was in the truck cab with him when the crash occurred. In Don's absence, Kathy has carried on an affair with Paul, the owner of the restaurant where she is employed as a waitress. Don's friend, Charlie, makes lecherous advances toward Cebe, and also forces a sexual relationship with Kathy, to whom he provides heroin. Cebe finds escapism in idolizing musicians such as Elvis Presley, Sid Vicious, and Johnny Rotten, and spends time alone in her father's wrecked semi-truck, which has been left abandoned on her family's property. She seeks further refuge from her unstable home life by sneaking into local bars, and hitchhiking to Vancouver. On one occasion in the city, Cebe accompanies a cab driver to his apartment to smoke marijuana. She narrowly escapes when the cabby and his prostitute girlfriend make sexual advances toward her. Cebe flees to a punk concert being put on by Pointed Sticks, a local band. She is treated kindly by the band members, who allow her to watch them perform from the stage; the drummer briefly allows her to play on his drum kit during the performance. Eventually, Cebe is apprehended by police as a runaway minor, and is evaluated by child psychologist Dr. Brean, who returns her to the care of her mother. Don is released from prison on probation after five years of incarceration, and returns home, where Kathy unsuccessfully attempts to regroup their family. Don continues to engage in reckless behavior and drinking, and shows little remorse for the accident he caused. When the father of one of the children killed in the crash gets Don fired from his job at a local landfill, Don retaliates with the help of Charlie by bludgeoning the man to death outside his home. Later, he shows Cebe a stick of dynamite he stole from the landfill, which he plans on selling for quick money. Don begins physically abusing Kathy, and the stress in the household causes Cebe to lash out at school. She is again evaluated by Dr. Brean, who comes to suspect that Don has sexually abused Cebe since childhood. Late one night, Don and Charlie get belligerently drunk at the Barnes' house, while Kathy uses heroin in the bathroom. The men joke about Cebe possibly being a lesbian, and Don suggests that Charlie rape her. This drives an incoherent Kathy to tears. Don and Charlie barrel into Cebe's bedroom, where she is dyeing her hair black to resemble that of Elvis. She rebuffs them both, proclaiming her hatred for her father, and forces them and an inconsolable Kathy out of the room. Don later returns to Cebe's bedroom, and recounts memories to her from her childhood. Cebe defiantly tells him she remembers his abuse, before cutting his throat with a pair of scissors, killing him. Cebe later awakens Kathy, dressed in her father's leather coat, and with a safety pin pierced through her cheek. Cebe insists that Kathy go with her to the wreckage of Don's truck, so they can have a conversation. Kathy agrees to go with her. In the truck, Cebe lights the wick of the dynamite, which she has hidden in the dashboard, and assures her mother it is only an electrical fuse from the wreckage. Moments later, Cebe references Sid Vicious, who \"took his loved ones with him\" when he died, before the wrecked truck explodes, killing them both.",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. --> In a sepia-tinted prologue, a United States Army private (Lee Marvin) kills a German soldier with his trench knife, not believing the man's claims the Great War is over. His company commander then tells him the war ended four hours earlier. In November 1942, during World War II, the US soldier is now a sergeant in the \"Big Red One\" leading a squad of infantrymen consisting of Private Griff, a cartoonist, Zab, an aspiring writer, Vinci and Johnson. They first landed unopposed at the beach landing in North Africa against the Vichy French army. By February, the squad and their battalion were forced to retreat after the disastrous defeat during the Battle of Kasserine Pass; the Sergeant was wounded, and taken as prisoner of war in a makeshift hospital, but he is freed after the fall of Tunis. After reuniting with the rest of the squad, they participate in an amphibious invasion of Sicily. As they fight their way in Italy, the Sergeant and his squad earned a reputation of the moniker: the Four Horsemen; since four of the soldiers in the squad have survived through both campaigns in Africa and Italy. The squad lands in the first wave of the assault on Omaha Beach on D-Day in Normandy, and fight through France, Belgium and the Huertgen Forest of Germany. A German Army sergeant named Schroeder is seen in many of the same battles, sharing the perspective of his American counterpart that soldiers are killers, but not murderers. The squad's participation in the battles is portrayed in a series of vignettes, including the rescue of a Belgian underground agent in a German-held asylum, an ambush of the squad by Schroeder which goes awry, and the squad's assistance to a French woman in labour which allows Schroeder to escape. The squad takes part in the liberation of Falkenau concentration camp in Czechoslovakia. Griff, whose courage is questioned throughout the film, is driven by the horrors of the camp to kill one of the guards who refuses to surrender. The sergeant befriends a child inmate who dies later that day. That night Schroeder, realizing the war is over, attempts to surrender but is stabbed by the sergeant. The squad informs him that the war in Europe ended four hours earlier. Griff notices that Schroeder is still alive and the sergeant and his men work frantically to save his life. Zab, in voice-over, remarks that he and his fellow American troops have more in common with the German, because they've survived the war, than they do with the many replacements they fought alongside, who are dead.",

    "Synopsis": "Witold, a graduate of a school for electricians, participates in high-mountain climbing during his military service. One of the mountaineers at the shelter mentions Witold's father, who died during a mountain expedition. Thanks to the business card he received from this mountaineer, Witold, after completing his military service, obtains a job in an exhibition company. Thanks to this, he often works abroad. While doing so, he notices that his boss, Mariusz, is issuing fraudulent visas. His mother becomes suddenly ill and Witold goes to a provincial town to visit her. In the hospital, he finds her on a bed in the corridor due to the lack of space. He intervenes unsuccessfully and nurse Grażyna tells him that a bribe should have been paid. His terminally ill mother returns home and then dies. Unable to shake off his mother's death, Witold, in an act of defiance, rebels against Mariusz when the latter, on his next business trip, invites him to take part in various minor frauds. For this, he is harassed by his colleagues, who are complicit with his boss. As Witold, together with his military colleague Stefan, is preparing for a planned trip to the Himalayas, his colleagues frame him, and at the customs clearance an undeclared amount of two hundred dollars was found on him. Witold loses his job, and the only person who stays close to him is Grażyna. Witold then earns his living as a window cleaner for skyscrapers and erecting scaffolding during the renovation of monuments. As an unregistered student, he attends lectures on mathematics at the Polytechnic. Although the professor encourages Witold to undertake regular studies, he is sceptical about the proposal. When one day he is working on scaffolding for a crumbling facade, a small child chasing a ball is hit with falling debris. The film ends with a scream from Witold.",

    "Synopsis": "During the years following the Civil War, banks and trains become the targets of the James-Younger gang, who terrorize the Midwestern United States. The band of robbers is led by Jesse James and Cole Younger, along with several of their brothers. After getting antsy during a bank robbery, Ed Miller opens fire and kills the clerk, resulting in a shootout where Jesse is wounded. Jesse dismisses Ed from the gang; his brother Clell remains. Mr. Rixley, a detective from the Pinkerton's agency, is assigned to capture the outlaws. Rixley doggedly remains on their trail, accidentally killing a Younger cousin and the youngest James brother, and losing several of his men in the process. Due to his errors, the Pinkertons back off. Jim Younger, who initially courted a girl named Beth, is disturbed to find her engaged to Ed. At Frank and Jesse's younger brother's funeral, he convinces Beth to leave Ed and she eventually marries him. Clell Miller suggests the James-Younger Gang ride north in September 1876 to rob a bank belonging to \"squareheads\" in Northfield, Minnesota; word is out about them and the town has been warned by the Pinkertons. The holdup goes wrong: the bank's vault has been set on a timer and cannot be opened. A cashier and another citizen are shot and killed. While trying to escape, the gang is fired upon by the townspeople. Two outlaws are killed, Clell is fatally shot, Frank is hit in the arm, and all of the Youngers are badly wounded. The surviving gang members temporarily make camp in the woods. Jesse decides to continue running, leaving the injured to their fate when a posse catches up to them. Though reluctant and threatened by Cole, Frank joins Jesse and they ride off. Jesse informs Frank he intends to strike up a new gang when they return to Missouri, but Frank is clearly reticent. The James brothers return home to Missouri and the Youngers are captured. Rixley interrogates the Youngers in prison, but they refuse to give up Jesse. Bob and Charley Ford offer to give up Jesse, who has asked them to join his new gang, for money. Rixley recruits them to assassinate Jesse for $15,000. They have dinner at Jesse's house and, while he adjusts a hanging picture, Bob kills him. Upon learning of his brother's assassination, Frank James turns himself in on the condition he can take Jesse home to be buried. Rixley complies with Frank in custody.",

    "Synopsis": "The year is 196303 BC. A group of cavemen rises from the mud, and the first thing on their minds is finding something to eat. After two unsuccessful attempts, the group decides to eat one of their own. Suddenly, the men meet women, but do not know how to make love to them. The elder of the men sees a pair of stegosaurus performing doggy style, which inspires the elder to do the same thing with one of the women. Nine months later, that same woman is pregnant with two boys, Ah and O. The cavemen like Ah, but are frightened by O and abandon him. Meanwhile, a brontosaurus abandons one of her eggs. Both O and the baby brontosaurus Igua meet, and instantly become friends. Years later, while trying to feed O, Igua comes across a stranded egg. Before O can try to eat it, the egg hatches and inside it is a baby pterodactyl named Croak. Croak and O become friends as well, but Igua becomes jealous and does not want O to see Croak again. As O grows up into an adult, he meets up with Croak again, who tries to help O become smarter. Their first \"lesson\" is how to fly. As O tries to fly, Igua steps in and takes O away. The next day, O looks in a pool of water and sees his reflection and discovers that he is a man, not a brontosaurus. He decides to leave Igua and search for his own kind. As O sets out into the jungle, he runs into several creatures that he mistakes for men, including a wild boar and a giant worm. At nightfall, O becomes lost in the jungle and has an encounter with a menagerie of unusual creatures that nearly kill him. However, he soon finds Croak and the two fly away together. While flying, Croak accidentally crashes into a dimorphodon and drops O, thus separating the two. Elsewhere, Igua tries to get together with his own kind. He finds a group of brontosauruses at a nearby lake, but they reject him due to Igua smelling too much like \"man\". Igua is crushed and decides to find O. As O begins to search for man, he comes across a group of workaholic creatures named \"No-Lobes\". They let him stay, but O causes chaos, which results in O discovering the wheel. After O destroys the No-Lobes's crops with the wheel, he is kicked out and the quest for man continues. While exploring, O is caught by a feline creature with a long tail, which she uses to seduce her victims before eating them. O decides to name her \"No-man\". \"No-man\" uses her tail to seduce O, then drags him off to her own kind. Before the felines eat him, they are distracted by a new-born baby. O and \"No-man\", who has a change of heart, run off together, with the others quickly behind them. O and \"No-man\" give them the slip, then they both have sex. While the two sleep, they are interrupted by a stampede of giant turtles. The feline tribe catches up with them, and catches \"No-man\". O uses a lone giant turtle shell and a couple of wheels to ride up to the tribe and tries to catch \"No-man\", but misses. O rolls off into the desert, leaving \"No-man\" to have her tail cut off. O crashes into a palm tree in the middle of the desert and is left to walk again. Later, O runs into Croak again. O is in need of water, and Croak just happens to be searching for water. They find what appears to be water, but before O can drink, he is stopped by a dragon. The dragon tries to breathe fire at O, but it comes out his anus instead. To get water, O decides to help the dragon by sticking a cork up the dragon's anus. This causes the dragon to breathe fire from his mouth. The dragon thanks O and lets him drink. However, the watering hole is in fact a tar pit, but the dragon gives him a lift to a nearby lake. After O drinks plenty of water, he takes a brief nap. When he wakes up, he sees that he is tied down to the ground by a colony of ants. O gets himself free and climbs up a tall building made out of grass, which cracks and sends O crashing into a pool of water, which drowns half of the ants. O continues on to the Arctic, and meets up with a group of Norwegian barbarians. O shows them fire, which intrigues the group. They use their fur coats to light up the fire even more, but the fire melts the ice and their coats are lost in the bottom of the ocean. The group chases after O, but Croak flies in and saves him. As Croak flies O to safety, O is eaten by a shark. O eventually escapes from the shark and finally meets his human family. The elder recognizes O and instantly dies. O takes over as leader and tells them that he'll teach man what he has learned on his travels. While teaching them, Igua finally catches up with O. However, O is still angry at Igua. Meanwhile, Ah (O's brother, though neither of them know that they are related) takes over as leader and shoves O away into the fire that was made by Ah. Igua saves him, and both O and Igua reconcile their friendship. Ah (in caveman talk) tells his people that they must show the world who is boss. They set out reshaping the Earth in their own image and destroy any creature standing in their way. As a result, the dragon disappears from the face of the Earth, the No-Lobes are all exterminated in a war against Ah, the dinosaurs drive themselves to extinction by committing mass suicide, the feline clan is slaughtered and used for clothing and jewelry (save for No-Man, who later dumps O), and the ant colony attempts to escape via a rocket made of grass, which ends up crashing back down and killing them all, as well as causing Pangaea to split into the Earth's continents. O, Croak and Igua escape the devastation and soon find a deserted island where they spend the rest of their lives, with O taking upon the title of the missing link and contemplating the severity of his actions.",

    "Synopsis": "The black-and-white film dramatizes the true story of a Berlin gang of thieves led by juvenile Werner Gladow during the time of the Berlin Blockade and Airlift. Likening Occupied Germany to the Prohibition era United States, writer-director Brasch paints a sympathetic portrait of organized crime in Germany facilitated by demoralization, lawlessness, and anarchy until the 1949 foundation of East and West Germany brings the old \"forces of order\" (as they are called by Gladow's partner in crime, Gustav Völpel, who used to hang Nazi war criminals for the Allied occupation forces) back to the forefront as former Nazis regain their pre-1945 positions in both German states. When eventually these \"forces of order\" come back to power at the end of the Berlin Blockade, they crack down on the anarchic Gladow Gang. Gladow himself is sentenced to death for murder and executed by East Germany at the age of 18 in 1950. Although ex-Nazis offer Völpel a job in the new West-German police if he'll flee to West Berlin, he prefers to stay in an East-German prison until he dies in 1959. This is because Völpel feels freer in prison than inside any ordered society, just as he did before when the Nazis incarcerated him for refusing to fight for them during the Second World War.",

    "Synopsis": "Rémi is a struggling pianist with a wife, Martine, a model who is getting too old to find desirable work, and a 14-year-old stepdaughter, Marion. When Martine is killed in a car crash, Marion expresses her desire to stay with Rémi in their apartment, but is taken away by her father Charly, an alcoholic who dislikes Rémi. Marion comes back, much to her father's disapproval, and takes up babysitting to help make ends meet while Rémi gives piano lessons. Soon, Marion tells Rémi she is physically attracted to him, but he resists her advances because of her young age. When Marion proves to be anemic, she is sent to the mountains with her father while Rémi loses his apartment and moves in with friends Simone and Nicolas.

    "Synopsis": "During a 1978 funeral service in London in honour of the life of Harold Abrahams, presided over by his former colleague Lord Andrew Lindsay, there is a flashback to his youth, when he was running along a beach with a group of athletes. In 1919, Harold Abrahams enters the University of Cambridge, where he experiences antisemitism but enjoys participating in the Gilbert and Sullivan club. He becomes the first person to complete the Trinity Great Court Run, running around the college courtyard in the time it takes for the clock to strike 12, and achieves victories in various national running competitions. Although focused on his running, he falls in love with Sybil Gordon, a leading Gilbert and Sullivan soprano. Eric Liddell, born in China to Scottish missionary parents, is in Scotland. His devout sister Jennie disapproves of Liddell's plans to pursue competitive running. Liddell sees running as a way of glorifying God before returning to China to work as a missionary. When they first race against each other, Liddell beats Abrahams. Abrahams takes it poorly, but Sam Mussabini, a professional trainer he had approached earlier, offers to take him on to improve his technique. This attracts criticism from the Cambridge college masters, who assert that it is not gentlemanly for an amateur to \"play the tradesman\" by employing a professional coach. Abrahams dismisses this concern, interpreting it as cover for antisemitic and class-based prejudice.<!--This is pretty well backed up by Gielgud's character's comments concerning \"a Semite,\" \"a different god\" etc--> When Liddell accidentally misses a church prayer meeting because of his running, Jennie upbraids him and accuses him of no longer caring about God. Eric tells her that, though he intends to return eventually to the China mission, he feels divinely inspired when he runs and that not to run would be to dishonour God. After years of training and racing, the two athletes are accepted to represent Great Britain in the 1924 Olympics in Paris. Also accepted are Abrahams's Cambridge friends, Andrew Lindsay, Aubrey Montague, and Henry Stallard. While boarding the boat to France for the Olympics, Liddell learns the 100-metre heats will be on a Sunday. Despite intense pressure from the Prince of Wales and the British Olympic Committee, he refuses to run the race on the Lord's Day. A solution is found thanks to Liddell's teammate Lindsay, who, having already won a silver medal in the 400 metres hurdles, offers his place in the 400-metre race on the following Thursday to Liddell. Liddell's religious convictions in the face of national athletic pride make headlines around the world; he delivers a sermon at the Paris Church of Scotland that Sunday. Abrahams is badly beaten by the heavily favoured United States runners in the 200-metre race. He knows his last chance for a medal will be the 100 metres. He competes in the race and wins. His coach Mussabini, who was barred from the stadium, is overcome that the years' dedication and training have paid off. Now Abrahams can get on with his life and reunite with his girlfriend Sybil, whom he has neglected for the sake of running. Liddell defeats the American favourites in the 400-metre race and wins the gold medal. The British team returns home triumphant. A textual epilogue reveals that Abrahams married Sybil and became a leading figure in British athletics, while Liddell went on to do missionary work and was mourned by all of Scotland after his death in Japanese-occupied China.",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words. --> In the Dark Ages, the sorcerer Merlin retrieves the magical sword Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake for Uther Pendragon, who is declared king. In exchange for their future child, Merlin helps Uther seduce Igrayne, the Duke of Cornwall's wife, while the Duke dies in battle. Igrayne gives birth to Arthur, and Merlin takes the boy. Ambushed by the Duke's men, a dying Uther thrusts Excalibur into a stone, as Merlin declares that he who pulls the sword from the stone shall be king. Merlin entrusts Ector to raise Arthur, who becomes squire to Ector's son Kay. As a young man, Arthur pulls Excalibur from the stone, proving he is Uther's rightful heir. Leodegrance pledges his allegiance to Arthur, but they are opposed by knights who dispute Arthur's kingship as a bastard. Defending Leondegrance's castle and his daughter Guenevere, Arthur defeats Uryens, whom he compels to knight him and swear fealty. Smitten with Guenevere, Arthur ignores Merlin's warning that she will one day fall in love with someone else. Years later, the undefeated knight Lancelot almost bests Arthur, who calls upon the power of Excalibur to defeat Lancelot, breaking the sword. The Lady of the Lake restores the sword to a remorseful Arthur, and Lancelot swears allegiance to him. Unifying the land, Arthur and his knights create the Round Table and the castle Camelot. Secretly infatuated with each other, Lancelot escorts Guenevere to her wedding to Arthur, declaring that his loyalty to the king outweighs his love for her. Arthur's half-sister Morgana reveals to Merlin that she is a sorceress, and Lancelot brings Perceval, who hopes to become a knight, to Camelot. Influenced by Morgana, Gawain drunkenly accuses Guenevere of betraying the king, and a duel over her innocence is set. Resolved to uphold the law as an impartial judge, Arthur cannot defend Guenevere's honor himself. When no champion will fight for the queen, Perceval steps forward, but Lancelot arrives and defeats Gawain, sparing his life. Retreating to the forest, Lancelot is followed by a deeply moved Guenevere, and they make love. Merlin confirms this to Arthur, who thrusts Excalibur into the ground between the sleeping lovers. Merlin's magical link to the land impales him on the sword, as Morgana traps him and steals his Charm of Making. Taking Guenevere's form, Morgana seduces Arthur and gives birth to a son, Mordred, infecting the land with famine and sickness. Struck by a magical bolt of lightning, a weakened Arthur sends his knights to search for the Holy Grail, hoping to restore the land and himself. Many knights die on their quest or are bewitched into Morgana's service, but Perceval resists her attacks. Mordred reaches adulthood, and his mother gifts him a golden suit of armour that she has enchanted so that no weapon made by man can pierce it. Mordred demands Arthur's crown, but Arthur can only offer him his love as his father, which is the only thing Mordred doesn't want from him, vowing to take Camelot by force. Unable to save Uryens from Mordred, Perceval is attacked by Lancelot, who has renounced his knighthood. Nearly drowned, Perceval is transported to the Grail and proves himself worthy, bringing the Grail to Arthur. He drinks from the Grail and is revitalised along with the land, calling upon Kay to rally their remaining forces against Mordred. Arthur finds Guenevere at a convent, and they reconcile before she gives him back Excalibur. At Stonehenge, Arthur's love liberates Merlin and they share a final conversation. Merlin tricks Morgana into speaking the Charm of Making, exhausting her powers and enveloping the battlefield in mist. Mordred discovers his now-haggard aged mother, murdering her in disgust. Arthur and his men battle Mordred's forces, using the mist in their favour. Lancelot comes to Arthur's aid, reconciling with his friend and dying a true knight. At the battle's end, only Arthur, Perceval, and Mordred remain alive. In single combat, Mordred mortally wounds Arthur, running him through with a spear. But Arthur slides down the spear's shaft and stabs Mordred through the heart with Excalibur (a weapon not made by man), killing him. Arthur commands Perceval to throw Excalibur into the water, knowing the sword will rise again for a worthy king. The Lady of the Lake catches the sword and disappears, and Perceval watches as Arthur is carried away on a ship toward Avalon.",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. --> In 1870, two young men, Jim Averill and Billy Irvine, graduate from Harvard College. The Reverend Doctor speaks to the graduates on the association of \"the cultivated mind with the uncultivated\" and the importance of education. Irvine, the class orator, follows this with his opposing, irreverent views. After a celebration, the male students serenade the women present, including Averill's girlfriend. In 1890, Averill is passing through the booming town of Casper, Wyoming, on his way north to Johnson County, where he is now a marshal. Poor European immigrants new to the region, conflict with wealthy, established cattle barons organized as the Wyoming Stock Growers Association; they suspect the newcomers are stealing their cattle for food. Nate Champion a friend of Averill and an enforcer for the stockmen kills a settler for suspected rustling and dissuades another from stealing a cow. At a board meeting, the head of the Association, Frank Canton, tells members, including a drunk Irvine, of plans to kill 125 named settlers, as thieves and anarchists, with the help of the cruel Major Wolcott. Irvine leaves the meeting, encounters Averill, and tells him of the Association's plans. As Averill leaves, he exchanges bitter words with Canton. Canton and Averill come to blows and Canton is knocked to the floor. That night, Canton recruits men to kill the settlers. Ellen Watson, a Johnson County bordello madam from Quebec who accepts stolen cattle as payment for use of her prostitutes, is infatuated with both Averill and Champion. Averill and Watson skate in a crowd, then dance alone, in an enormous roller skating rink called \"Heaven's Gate\", which has been built by local entrepreneur John L. Bridges. Averill receives a copy of the Association's death list from Minardi, a baseball-playing U.S. Army captain, and later reads the names aloud to the settlers, who are thrown into terrified turmoil. Cully, a station master and friend of Averill's, sees the train with Canton's posse heading north and rides off to warn the settlers but is murdered en route. Later, a group of men come to Watson's bordello, slaughter her workers, and rape her. Averill shoots and kills all but one of them. Champion, realizing that his landowner bosses seek to eliminate Watson, goes to Canton's camp and shoots Morrison, the remaining rapist, then refuses to participate in the slaughter. Canton, Wolcott, and their men encounter one of Champion's friends, who is leaving a cabin with Champion and his friend Nick Ray inside, and a gunfight ensues. Attempting to save Champion, Watson arrives in her wagon and shoots one of the hired guns before escaping on horseback. Nick is killed before Canton's men push a burning cart towards the cabin, setting it on fire. Champion writes a last letter to Ella before emerging from the burning cabin shooting at Canton's men but is killed by a hail of bullets. Watson warns the settlers of Canton's approach at another vast, chaotic gathering at \"Heaven's Gate\". The cowardly mayor of the county, Charlie Lezak, proposes to deliver the people on the list peacefully. At the same time, the young pharmacist Mr. Eggleston claims that the only way to survive is to arm themselves and fight the enemy army. The agitated settlers approve Eggleston's idea and rush to battle with Bridges and Ella leading them. With the hired invaders now surrounded, both sides suffer casualties (including a drunken, poetic Irvine) as Canton leaves to bring help. Watson and Averill return to Champion's charred and smoking cabin, and discover his corpse, along with a handwritten letter documenting his last minutes alive. The next day, Averill reluctantly joins the immigrant settlers, with their cobbled-together siege machines and explosive charges, in an attack against Wolcott's men and their makeshift fortifications. The battle is fiercer and more desperate. Despite the heavy losses that the immigrants suffer, including Eggleston himself, they manage to inflict a vast number of casualties on the mercenaries' army. Wolcott himself, while trying to escape, is killed by Averill, who hits him with an explosive charge. Before the settlers wipe out the enemies, the US Army shows up with Canton and Minardi, thus stopping the battle. The mercenaries are arrested, though Averill knows this is just a facade to save them and make them avoid a criminal charge. Later, at Watson's cabin, Bridges, Watson, and Averill prepare to leave for good, but Canton and two others ambush them. Averill and Bridges shoot and kill Canton and one of his men, but both Bridges and Watson are killed. A grief-stricken Averill holds Watson's body in his arms. In 1903, a well-dressed, beardless, but older-looking Averill walks the deck of his yacht off Newport, Rhode Island. He goes below, where an attractive middle-aged woman sleeps in a luxurious boudoir. The woman, Averill's old Harvard girlfriend (perhaps now his wife), awakens and asks him for a cigarette. Silently he complies, lighting the cigarette and returning to the deck.",

    "Synopsis": "Activist Maciek Tomczyk, the son of Man of Marble<nowiki/>'s hero Mateusz Birkut, is leading a shipyard strike in Gdańsk against the Communist authorities. An alcoholic radio journalist named Winkel is ordered by the deputy chairman of the Radio Committee to investigate Tomczyk and find compromising information about him. Winkel is sent to Gdańsk, where he is monitored by the authorities. The strikers refuse to give Winkel access to the shipyard, but he meets a friend, Dzidek. Dzidek knew Tomczyk in college and later recounts how Tomczyk's father, Mateusz Birkut, would not allow his son to take part in the student protests in March 1968. From another source, Tomczyk learns that Birkut himself died during protests in December 1970. Winkel becomes increasingly sympathetic to the strikers' cause but continues his investigation under pressure from the authorities. After his father's death, Tomczyk married Agnieszka, whom he had met when making a documentary about Birkut's career as a well-publicized Stakhanovite worker hero. Winkel visits Agnes, who is now in police custody for her support of the strike. Agnes describes her romance and marriage with Tomczyk and their fight for workers' rights. Despite being blackmailed by the secret police for a drunk driving crash in his past, Winkel ultimately refuses to complete his assignment and resigns from his job. He is admitted to the shipyard, where he joins the strikers. A government delegation reaches an agreement with Lech Wałęsa and the other strikers, and Agnes tearfully reunites with Tomczyk during the announcement. A government official warns that the agreement is \"only a piece of paper,\" but Tomczyk tells his father's memorial that the strikers have \"made it through the worst.\"",

    "film_title": "Mephisto (1981 film)",
    "Synopsis": "The film adapts the story of Mephistopheles and Doctor Faustus by revealing the costs to the main character Hendrik Höfgen as he abandons his conscience and continues to perform, ingratiating himself with the Nazi Party to keep his job and improve his social position. Höfgen (modelled on German actor Gustaf Gründgens) craves center stage. The first third of the film follows his career as a frustrated, passionate actor slogging it out in provincial theaters, occasionally dancing and singing and doing parts in films to gain notice. He even founds a Bolshevik theater with a friend to generate more work, in the avant-garde period of the early 1930s, before the Nazis came to power. Initially, Hendrik is more successful in his social and love life than as an actor. Both strands unite when his new wife watches him play the ultimate role, Mephisto (the devil's agent in the Faustus play), just before the Nazi party comes to power in Germany. While his wife, leading actors, and friends go into exile, or protest against the new regime, Hendrik returns to Germany lured by the promise of forgiveness for his communist theatre escapade and a desire to act in his native language. When the Nazi party offers to make him a star, he doesn't hesitate. Great roles and accolades quickly come his way, and Hendrik revels in his success. Hendrik reprises his greatest role as Mephisto and agrees to run the national theatre, working around the cultural restrictions and brutality of the Nazi government. He blithely overlooks the profound moral compromises of his situation, excusing himself by using the power of his close relationships with Nazi officials to help friends who would otherwise be targeted by the regime. The plot's bitter irony is that the protagonist's fondest dream is to become Germany's greatest actor, playing Hamlet and Mephisto but to achieve this dream he sells his soul and realizes too late that he is not playing the role of Mephisto but that of Faustus; it is the Nazi leader with a major role in the film (modeled on Hermann Göring) who is the real Mephisto.",

She tries to \"spice up\" her existence by surprising the family when she eats their entire dinner, setting the bedclothes on fire and poisoning the pet dog's milk and then advising it not to drink (the dog does not drink). Eventually Martin, Marilyn's husband, decides to have a psychiatrist see her, but it only serves to provoke her behaviour, and further exacerbate her frustration. One day, Marilyn decides to accompany her husband on a business trip, but she gets detained by airport security on a technicality. After missing her plane, Marilyn is befriended by a group of Yugoslavs, and is taken to a club they run, bearing the odd name of 'Zanzi-Bar'. Marilyn indulges in their fantastic, surreal world of shovel fighting, lamb roasting, striptease and free love. It all culminates with Marilyn having a passionate fling with a young man named Montenegro who works in a zoo. After spending the night with Montenegro, Marilyn realizes that even though she adores this world, she is a stranger in it. Completely snapping upon this realization, she kills the young man and returns home. Once back home, Marilyn serves her family a sumptuous gourmet dinner, followed by a light dessert of fruit – which a caption announces is poisoned.

    "Synopsis": "In the Pigalle and Barbès neighborhoods of Paris, Anita, a bartender, keeps frequent company with Jocko, a West Indian preacher, and Willy, an aspiring kickboxer from Hungary, but takes particular care and worry about Bobby, a teenager selling \"neige\" (heroin), in the midst of a visiting Christmas carnival full of games of chance and strippers. When word is out police are closing in on drug dealers, Anita begs Bobby to lie low and stop dealing, but he ignores Anita's warnings. Bobby is identified to narcotics detectives by Bruno, a neighborhood taxi driver, whose wife is in prison for shooting an earlier dealer who sold their son a fatal dosage; they have promised early parole for her in exchange for the tip. Bobby is ultimately found, pursued, and shot dead by the detectives. With this killing, several residents of the neighborhood are cut off from their regular doses, including Betty, a trans cabaret performer. Hoping to stave off a fatal withdrawal, Anita seeks help from Jocko and Willy to find another source of heroin to keep Betty alive. Jocko proceeds through a series of random people before finally locating the local provider, an Arab shopkeeper, who agrees to sell a quantity to him. Willy seems resistant to her idea, but uses his own connections to get some. Anita, put off by Willy's reaction, cuts communication with him, and tells Jocko she will deliver the heroin to Betty. Through a combination of surveillance, phone taps, and another likely informant, the police find out about the meeting between Betty and Anita. Willy tries to contact Betty on his own, but the cabaret proprietor refuses to tell him when she is scheduled to perform, and a fellow trans prostitute friend of Betty's lies about seeing her, thinking Willy a threat. Willy later sees Betty taken into custody by police, and sets out to warn his friends. Plainclothes police infiltrate the club where Anita and Jocko are biding time. One confronts Jocko, warning him not to tip off anyone or interfere. When Anita goes to the bathroom to place the heroin in a hiding place, she is intercepted by two narcs. Willy enters, manages to disarm one officer, and tries to bully the other into letting her go. However, a third officer enters and shoots Willy dead. Jocko leaves the scene, it is assumed that Anita has been arrested, and Betty's fate is left ambiguous.",

    "Synopsis": "In Turin in the winter of 1862, the unmarried Giorgio Bacchetti, a good-looking cavalry captain with a distinguished combat record, is involved in a passionate affair with Clara, a sweet and beautiful married woman. Their meetings end when he is transferred to an isolated outpost on the frontier. The officers there eat and socialise in the house of their colonel, who has given a home to a handicapped cousin of his. This is a young woman named Fosca, suffering not only from a range of physical and psychological problems but also strikingly ugly. Yet she is also sensitive and cultured, and desperate for sympathetic male company. Encouraged by the regimental surgeon, who thinks contact with the new arrival may help, Giorgio spends time with her. While she thrives on what to her is a conquest, Giorgio is dragged down by the emotional strain of her demands on him and falls ill. The surgeon realises that his plan was a mistake and that the only solution is to get Giorgio a transfer. The transfer notice is delivered during the Christmas party in the colonel's house. Fosca goes into massive hysterics, to the horror of the guests who had no idea of the existence and depth of her passion. The colonel, considering his honour impugned by this relationship, which Giorgio entered into out of kindness and pity, challenges Giorgio to a duel next morning. That night, knowing it may be his last and desperately sorry for Fosca, he goes to her bedroom and they consummate their strange love. In the duel, he wounds the colonel but himself collapses under the nervous strain. Fosca dies of shock, and Giorgio is invalided out of the army with no prospects.",

    "Synopsis": "<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700.--> Mark is a spy who returns home to West Berlin from an espionage mission to find that his wife, Anna, wants a divorce, and is seeing someone new. Mark reluctantly turns the apartment and custody of their young son, Bob, over to her. After recovering from a destructive drinking spree, he visits the apartment to find Bob alone, unkempt, and neglected. When Anna returns, he stays with Bob, refusing to leave her alone with the child, but attempts to make amends. Anna leaves in the middle of the night. Mark receives a phone call from Anna's lover, Heinrich, telling him that Anna is with him. The next day, Mark meets Bob's teacher, Helen, who inexplicably looks identical to Anna but with green eyes. Mark visits and fights Heinrich, who beats him. Mark then beats Anna at home, after which she flees. The following day, they have another hysterical argument during which they both cut themselves with an electric knife; Anna on the throat and Mark on the arm. Mark hires a private investigator to follow Anna and discovers she has been keeping a second flat in a derelict apartment building. When the investigator finds a bizarre tentacled creature in the bathroom, Anna kills him with a broken bottle. The lover of the now-dead detective, Zimmermann, goes to the flat himself, where he finds the creature and his lover's dead body. Anna beats Zimmermann in a rage before stealing his gun and shooting him to death. Anna continues her erratic behavior and recounts to Mark a violent miscarriage she suffered in the subway while he was gone. She claims it resulted in a nervous breakdown; during the miscarriage, she oozed blood and white fluids from her orifices. Heinrich visits Anna at the second apartment and is shocked to discover the creature in the bedroom, as well as a collection of dismembered body parts in her refrigerator. She stabs him, and Heinrich flees, bleeding. Heinrich calls Mark and begs him to pick him up. Mark stops by Anna's apartment first and discovers the body parts; the creature, however, is gone. Mark meets Heinrich at the bar, where he murders him but stages it as an accidental death in the bathroom stall. He then sets Anna's apartment on fire before fleeing on Heinrich's motorcycle. At home, he finds Anna's friend Margit on the brink of death as she emerges from the lift, bleeding from knife wounds. She dies; he drags the body inside, where Anna greets him, and the two have sex in the kitchen. Afterward, he makes plans to cover up Margit’s death. He then discovers Anna having sex with the creature. Heinrich's mother phones Mark, asking about her son. When he goes to meet with her, she dies by suicide by overdosing on pills. As Mark wanders the street the next day, his former associates pressure him to rejoin them. He is evasive and returns to Margit’s apartment to find it surrounded by police and his former employers. He stages a distraction, allowing someone to sneak away in his car, but he is wounded in the ensuing shootout. Fleeing on the motorbike, he has a horrific accident and races into a building, where he is pursued by Anna, the police, and his associates. Anna reveals the creature, now fully formed a doppelgänger of Mark with green eyes. Mark raises his gun to shoot it, but a hail of bullets from the police below strikes him and Anna down. Bloodied and dying, Anna lies atop Mark and uses his gun to shoot herself. She dies in his arms, and he jumps to his death down the stairwell. The doppelgänger heads up the stairs, encountering a young woman. He gives her Mark's gun and instructs her to fire on his pursuers so he can get away. As if in a trance, she complies. The doppelgänger leaves her and flees through the roof. Helen is at the flat babysitting Bob when the doorbell rings. Bob implores her not to open the door, but Helen ignores him. Bob races through the flat into the bathroom, where he submerges himself in the bathtub face-down, drowning himself. The sounds of sirens, planes, and explosions fill the air outside. The silhouette of Mark's doppelgänger is seen from the frosted glass door as Helen stares straight ahead, her eyes shining.",

    "Synopsis": "The beautiful Marya \"Mado\" Zelli is living with her husband Stephan, a Polish art dealer, in 1927 Paris. When he is convicted of selling stolen artwork, and imprisoned for one year, Marya is left penniless, with no means to support herself. At Stephan's urging, she moves into the apartment of some acquaintances, H.J. Heidler, a wealthy English art dealer, and his wife Lois, a painter. H.J. Heidler has a history of inviting vulnerable young women to move into the \"spare room\" only to seduce them. Lois permits this arrangement because she wants to keep H.J. from leaving her. Marya becomes involved in the decadent Parisian lifestyle of the Heidlers and their group of fellow expatriates. Although she initially resists H.J.'s advances, Mado eventually begins an affair with him. The strain of living with the Heidlers begins to manifest itself; Marya becomes desperate to leave, and begs Lois to lend her money so she can get away. Lois, although extremely unhappy with the situation, is reluctant to interfere at the risk of alienating H.J. Her behavior towards Marya is increasingly passive-aggressive and insulting. During a hunting excursion to the countryside, Marya angrily confronts the pair, causing Lois to break down in anguish. After this H.J. arranges for Marya to live in a hotel, where he visits her less frequently for sexual trysts. She grows lonely and depressed, contemplating suicide. During a tea party at the Heidlers', Lois casually reveals that H.J.'s previous mistress drowned herself in despair. When things are at their worst, Stephan is released from prison and must leave France immediately. Heidler threatens to cut ties with her entirely if she returns to her husband, and although Marya has longed to be re-united with Stephan, she is unable to choose between the two. Stephan realizes the truth, and the film ends with him leaving Marya to an uncertain future.",

    "Synopsis": "Naples, 1944. General Mark Clark, commander of the United States Fifth Army, is negotiating with Eduardo Marzullo, a Camorra mobster, the delivery of 112 German soldiers captured during the four days of insurrection. Marzullo demands from the Americans a bribe of one hundred lire per kilo, susceptible to strong increases if not quickly paid, for each prisoner. The intermediary is the Italian liaison captain Curzio Malaparte who is also given the task of pleasing the aviator wife of an American senator, and of organizing a Renaissance style dinner that has as its highlight a fish: a \"siren\" of the Naples aquarium which looks like a cooked child. Meanwhile in the slums, mothers sell their children as prostitutes to the Moroccan soldiers, and Jim, the young American liaison captain friend of Malaparte, falls in love with a young girl. He discovers she is being exposed by her father for a fee as the only virgin existing in the city. Malaparte moves in this \"hell on earth\" scenario with detachment. He tries to explain to the woman, during an orgy of homosexuals, that it is the corrupting power of the Americans which has so reduced the moral qualms of the starving people of the city, who are now severely impoverished by the war. Vesuvius suddenly breaks out in an eruption, during which the aviator undergoes a cruel rape experience from a group of drunken and upset soldiers, an experience that brings her to the same level of all the other innocent and defeated women around her. The story ends with the arrival of the Fifth Army in Rome through the Appian Way. Among the crowd that welcomes the Americans, and amidst the enthusiasm of the liberation, an unfortunate man ends up crushed under a military tank.",

    "Synopsis": "Frank is a jewel thief and ex-convict who has a set structure to his life since being released from Joliet Correctional Center in Joliet, Illinois. With a pair of successful Chicago businesses (a bar and a car dealership) as fronts for his criminal enterprise, Frank sets out to fulfill the missing part of his life vision: a family with Jessie, a cashier he has begun dating. After taking down a major diamond score, Frank gives the diamonds to his fence, Joe Gags. However, before Frank can collect his $185,000 share, Gags is thrown from a twelve-story window for skimming from the payments he had been collecting from loan shark clients. Barry, Frank's friend and associate making the pickup, discovers that Attaglia, a plating company executive Gags was working for, is responsible for Gags' murder and stealing Frank's payoff. In a confrontation at the plating company, Frank demands his money back. This leads to a meeting with Attaglia's employer Leo, a high-level fence and Chicago Outfit boss. Unknown to Frank, Leo has been receiving Frank's goods from Gags for some time. Leo returns the money and says he admires Frank's eye for quality stolen goods and professionalism. He wants Frank working directly for him, offering large profits. Their meeting is monitored from a distance by police surveillance. Frank is initially reluctant, not wanting the added exposure or complications, but later that night, a conversation with Jessie changes his mind when she agrees to be part of his life, after he relates a tale of prison survival via a toughened mental attitude. Frank now agrees to do just one big score for Leo, telling Barry that this will be their last job. After being rejected at the state adoption agency, with Leo's help, Frank is able to acquire a baby boy on the black market, whom he names David after his late mentor, nicknamed Okla. After resisting a shakedown from a group of corrupt police detectives, and then subsequently ditching their surveillance, Frank and his crew are involved in a large-scale Los Angeles diamond heist organized by Leo. All goes well with Frank's \"burn job\" and he is expecting the agreed-upon sum of $830,000 for the unmounted stones with a wholesale value $4 million. But when Frank returns from the job, Leo gives him less than $100,000. This is all that Frank will receive in cash, according to Leo, who says he invested the rest of Frank's cut in shopping centers in Fort Worth and Dallas, Texas, an idea Frank had previously rejected. In addition, Leo has set up a Palm Beach score for Frank in six weeks without consulting him. Frank tells Leo that their deal is over and takes the cash as he leaves, demanding the rest of his money in 24 hours. Frank drives to his car lot, unaware that Leo's henchmen have already beaten and captured Barry and are waiting to ambush him. Frank is knocked out, and Barry is killed by the enforcers. Frank awakens with Leo staring down at him, surrounded by his henchmen. Leo informs him that he, Jessie, their child, and everything he owns are Leo's property. He threatens Frank's family if he does not continue working for him. Leo warns Frank to focus on his responsibilities. When Frank returns home, he orders an uncomprehending Jessie out of their house, telling her their marriage is over, that she must immediately leave, and that he will not be joining her. Frank instructs an associate to drive her, the baby, and $410,000 in cash to somewhere where they cannot be located. With nothing to lose, Frank blows up their home using high-explosive charges. He then drives to his business establishments and does likewise. Armed with a pistol, he quietly breaks into Leo's house in a peaceful neighborhood and pistol whips Attaglia in the kitchen. Frank hunts for Leo, killing him in the living room. Frank then pursues Attaglia as he tries to escape from the house but is confronted in the front yard by Leo's bodyguards. In the ensuing gunfight, Frank is shot but manages to kill the trio. Frank loosens what appears to be a bulletproof vest he was wearing beneath his jacket and walks away into the night.",

His wife Barbara, on the other hand, is a refined woman of French origin. One day, their son Giovanni is kidnapped by a group of terrorists and Primo has to raise a billion lire for the ransom. Meanwhile, the dairy he owns is hit by a serious economic crisis. A young worker, Laura, Giovanni's girlfriend, and a worker priest, Adelfo, who know a lot about the kidnapping, intervene in the story. From them, Primo learns that his son has died.

    "Synopsis": "The choreographer Antonio is preparing a performance of George Bizet's opera Carmen, intending to infuse it with Spanish music and flamenco dances. He collaborates with Paco, a guitarist who adapts the original music for his instrument. Despite searching his flamenco school for the perfect Carmen, Antonio struggles to find the right fit. His best dancer, Cristina, is deemed too old for the role. However, Carmen herself catches his eye during a rehearsal, captivating him with her fiery dance and allure. After a flamenco show, Antonio gifts Carmen a book by Prosper Mérimée, urging her to read it, convinced she's destined for the role. He then enlists Cristina to train Carmen intensively. During rehearsals, Antonio guides the actors to imagine the setting and atmosphere, setting the stage for Carmen and Cristina's intense rivalry, performed through dance. As Antonio falls for Carmen, they share a passionate encounter. Yet, Carmen abruptly leaves in the night, revealing she's married. Despite this, Antonio gives her money when she claims her husband wants to start afresh. However, Carmen's husband reveals his intentions to continue his criminal activities, sparking a physical altercation between him and Antonio. In a pivotal scene, Carmen's betrayal becomes evident when Antonio discovers her with another man. The tension escalates when Carmen tells Antonio that their relationship is finished. Driven by jealousy, he kills her with a switchblade. The performance blurs the lines between reality and fiction as Antonio and Carmen's relationship unravels onstage. Ultimately, Antonio's desperation leads to tragedy, leaving the audience questioning what is real and what is part of the performance.",

    "film_title": "Cross Creek (film)",
    "Synopsis": "In 1928 in New York State, aspiring author Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings advises her husband that her last book was rejected by a publisher, she has bought an orange grove in Florida, and she is leaving him to go there. She drives to the nearest town alone, and arrives in time for her car to die. Local resident Norton Baskin takes her the rest of the distance to a dilapidated and overgrown cabin attached to an even more overgrown orange grove. Despite Baskin's (and her own) doubts, she stays and begins to fix up the property. The local residents of \"the Creek\" begin to interact with her. Marsh Turner comes around with his daughter Ellie, a teenage girl who keeps a deer fawn as a pet named Flag. A black woman, Geechee, arrives and offers to work for her, even though Rawlings insists she cannot pay her much. The grove languishes below her expectations and Rawlings writes another novel, hoping to get it published. A young married couple moves into a cabin on Rawlings's property. The woman is pregnant and they reject Rawlings's attempts to help them. Rawlings employs the assistance of a few of the Creek residents, Geechee and Baskin, to unblock a vital irrigation vein for her grove, and it begins to improve. The young couple has their child. Ellie's deer grows older and escapes her pen, and Marsh foretells that the deer will have to be killed for eating all their food. Geechee's husband comes to stay with her after being released from prison, and Rawlings offers him a place to work in her grove, but he refuses and Rawlings asks him to leave. Even though her husband drinks and gambles, Geechee goes to leave with him, and Rawlings admits she will be sad to see Geechee leave, after Geechee demands to know why Rawlings would allow a friend to make such a mistake. Geechee decides to stay after all after telling Rawlings that she should learn how to treat her friends better. Rawlings submits her novel, a gothic romance, to Max Perkins, and it is rejected again. He writes to ask her to write stories about the people she describes so well in her letters instead of the English governess stories she has been writing. She does so immediately, beginning with the story of the young married couple (which eventually becomes \"Jacob's Ladder,\" published in Scribner's Magazine in 1931). During a visit to the Turners' home on Ellie's 14th birthday, Flag escapes his pen once more and Marsh is forced to shoot him after he eats the family's vegetables. Ellie screams at him in hatred, and Marsh goes on a bender, goes into town and attracts the sheriff's attention. The sheriff finds Marsh drinking moonshine with a shotgun across his lap and demands the gun. When Marsh offers it to him, the sheriff shoots him. The story becomes the basis for The Yearling. At Marsh's funeral, Ellie blames Rawlings for Marsh's and Flag's deaths and tells her to leave. Rejected and heartbroken, Rawlings leaves her home in a motorboat and rides down the waterways for several miles. After more than a day in complete isolation and loneliness out in the water, she returns to her home and is happily reunited with Geechee. A few nights later, Rawlings and Geechee find themselves battling to save their orange grove from the autumn frost. The neighbors arrive to help her out, and among them are Ellie and her younger siblings. Ellie apologizes to Rawlings for her behavior at Marsh's funeral, stating that “good friends shouldn’t keep apart,” and they reconcile. Perkins visits and accepts her story \"Jacob's Ladder\" upon reading it. Baskin asks Rawlings to marry him, and she accepts after much hesitation about her independence. Rawlings realizes her profound attachment to the land at Cross Creek.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1957, Estrella, a young girl living in northern Spain, awakens to learn her father Agustín has died. Seven years prior, he had worked as a physician and a dowser who divinely locates underground water using a pendulum. One night, after he returns home, Estrella tries to enter her father's attic but is prevented by her mother Julia. Meanwhile, Estrella is educated by her mother in calligraphy and literature. She learns from Julia that her father had lived in southern Spain—\"El Sur\"—during his childhood, but left after a dispute with Estrella's grandfather. Months pass, and Estrella's grandmother Rosario and her friend Milagros arrive to attend Estrella's First Communion. One night before bedtime, Milagros explains that during the Spanish Civil War, her grandfather supported Francisco Franco while Agustín was a Republican. When the Civil War ended, and Franco had assumed power, Agustín vowed to never return to the south again. Estrella proceeds with her communion ceremony and dances with her father afterwards. Shortly after, she enters her father's study and finds drawings he had made of his former lover named Irene Ríos. Later, Estrella arrives at a movie theater, and discovers Irene Ríos is an actress whose name is featured on a film poster. She asks a box office clerk for a program, and watches her father walking into the theater to view her film. He leaves early and arrives at a café where he writes a letter to Irene, whose real name is Laura, asking for her whereabouts. Days later, Irene replies curious why he is contacting her after several years. She also details her career struggles and life experiences as an older woman since they stopped dating. Depressed, Agustín leaves but returns home the next morning with no one noticing and stops using his pendulum. In frustration, Estrella hides underneath her bed for several hours, which causes her mother and their maid Casilda to look for her. Julia eventually finds her while Agustín remains isolated. In 1957, Estrella matures into a young teenager. At home, she is being romantically pursued by a young man, nicknamed \"El Carioco.\" She traverses the theater looking for film posters with Irene's name featured, but finds none. Her father invites her to the Grand Hotel where Estrella converses with her father about the night she followed him to the theater and café. She leaves, and sometime later, Agustín dies by suicide near a lakeshore. Estrella finds a receipt of a long-distance telephone call among her father's belongings, but decides to tell no one. She becomes ill, and her mother allows her to stay with her grandmother in southern Spain to recuperate.",

    "film_title": "Eréndira (film)",
    "Synopsis": "Eréndira, a teenaged girl, lives with her eccentric, heartless grandmother in a vast, gloomy house in a windswept desert region. Exploited by her grandmother, Eréndira must work all day doing household chores, until she sleepwalks due to exhaustion. The grandmother lives in her own world, talking to herself, crying uncontrollably over sentimental French songs, and acting out wild dreams while she sleeps. One day Eréndira is so tired from constant work that she falls asleep without extinguishing the candles. A sudden night wind blows the curtains into the candle flames; the curtains catch fire, and the house burns down to the foundation walls. Miraculously, Eréndira and her grandmother survive. Having calculated the debt Eréndira owes her for the destruction of her home and belongings, the grandmother decides the only way the girl will be able to repay such a vast amount is through prostitution. Eréndira submits to her fate without protest and the grandmother does not waste time trading Eréndira's virginity to a seedy local merchant for 250 pesos and three days' provisions. When Eréndira resists, the man slaps and rapes her. Eréndira and her grandmother subsequently travel through the desert while the young girl sells her body to countless men – peasants, Indians, humble workers, soldiers and smugglers that populate the region. The grandmother collects the money, makes all the decisions, and pays the Indian servants. As the business prospers it achieves carnivalesque proportions: the two women are joined by hangers-on, vendors, musicians, and a mysterious photographer. One day, having had sex with an army of soldiers, Eréndira falls sick and the line of men waiting outside her tent is dismissed. Then, Ulises, the young son of a smuggler traveling through the region, sneaks into the tent after the old woman has gone to sleep. Eréndira finds him charming; she charges him for her services and teaches him how to make love. By the next morning Ulises has fallen in love with her. En route from one town to the next, a group of monks abduct Eréndira, in an attempt to save her from her grandmother's predations. The grandmother swears to the monks that she will get her granddaughter back. The monks send her to their mission in the desert, where Eréndira works alongside other young girls. Eventually, all the girls are commanded to marry, to purify their souls. Eréndira's grandmother hires a Mexican peasant boy to marry Eréndira and after she is freed, she returns to her grandmother and resumes her sexual servitude. To undermine any further attempts by the priests to confiscate her money-making resource, the grandmother schemes to obtain a letter from someone important testifying to her granddaughter's high moral character. The grandmother sends Eréndira to Senator Onésimo Sanchez, a man dying of some mysterious disease. The crafty woman locks a chastity belt on Eréndira, which the Senator discovers cannot be unlocked until he writes the letter. The grandmother's business suffers a second setback when Ulises reappears and persuades Eréndira to run off with him. His plan is to live off a fortune from oranges which contain diamonds smuggled by his Dutch father. Before they flee, the photographer warns them about bad omens. The young couple head for the border in a truck stolen from the boy's father. They are chased by local police, the grandmother, and the father of Ulises. One of the officers shoots the photographer, who is accused by the grandmother of being an accomplice to the escape. When the couple are finally caught, Eréndira watches from the truck as her lover suffers a whipping from his father. To prevent further escape attempts, the grandmother chains Eréndira to the bed. However, the town's angry prostitutes, bereft of business because the local men want Eréndira, march to their competitor's tent and haul the young woman out of it over the old woman's curses. By now the Grandmother is quite wealthy. She and Eréndira live by the sea in a large tent, furnished even more grandly than the lost desert home. The old woman plays her piano, bathes, and gives orders to her now hardened charge. Realizing that only her grandmother's death would free her, Eréndira pushes Ulises to kill the old woman. His first two attempts on her life by poisoning and an explosive are unsuccessful. Finally, goaded by Eréndira, he picks up a kitchen knife and stabs the old woman in the back. With his grandmother's death, Eréndira's palm suddenly acquires lines. She picks up her grandmother's vest of gold and runs off into the desert, leaving Ulises behind in tears. \"No voice on earth could stop me,\" Eréndira tells us in a voiceover as she disappears into the desert. \"And no trace of my misfortune was ever found.\"",

    "film_title": "Heat and Dust (film)",
    "Synopsis": "In 1982, an Englishwoman named Anne (Julie Christie) begins an investigation into the fate of her great-aunt Olivia (Greta Scacchi), whose letters and the diary she has inherited. She interviews the elderly Harry Hamilton-Paul (Nickolas Grace), who in his youth was Olivia's close friend when they were both living in India. Anne's search brings her to India, where the story of Olivia's life is told in flashbacks. In 1923, during the British Raj, Olivia, recently married to Douglas Rivers (Christopher Cazenove), a civil servant in the colonial administration, has come to join her husband in Satipur, in central India. Douglas is an attentive husband and the couple seems to be very much in love. When he insists that Olivia spend the summer in Simla to avoid the extreme heat, she refuses in order to remain with him. However, the conventional narrow society of the English memsahibs bores her. Mrs. Saunders (Jennifer Kendal), the morbid wife of the local doctor, warns Olivia that all Indian men are potential rapists. Mrs. Crawford (Susan Fleetwood), the Burra Memsahib, is kindly but equally conservative. The racist Doctor Saunders takes an instant dislike to Olivia. While Anglo-Indian society seems to have little to offer Olivia, she is slowly enthralled by India itself. The region is being ransacked by a group of sanguinary bandits, and intrigues are opposing the British community led by Major Minnies and Mr. Crawford against the ruler of the neighboring princely state, the Nawab of Khatm (Shashi Kapoor). The British suspect him of being in league with a gang of bandits, allowing them to operate with impunity in exchange for a share of their booty. The Nawab, a romantic and decadent minor prince who combines British distinction with Indian pomp and ruthlessness, invites all the Anglo-Indian officials and their wives for a dinner party at his palace. At the dinner, Olivia attracts the attention of the Nawab. Harry Hamilton-Paul enjoys a close intimacy with the Nawab and is a permanent guest at the palace. With his good humor and charm, Harry serves as a sort of court jester and he is well-liked even by the chain-smoking and proud Begum Mussarat Jahan (Madhur Jaffrey), the Nawab's mother. In the midst of the intense summer heat, Harry falls ill and Olivia comes often to visit him at the Nawab's palace. The Nawab easily seduces Olivia and they engage in an illicit affair. Following in Olivia’s footsteps, Anne comes to Satipur to live in the same surroundings that framed Olivia’s story more than fifty years earlier. She stays as the guest of an Indian family. The head of the household, Inder Lal (Zakir Hussain), is a polite civil servant who serves as her guide while she tries to get connected with the world that Olivia lived. Inder Lal is worried that their hitherto innocent relationship will be perceived as sexual. Lal is married with children and lives with his wife and his mother. Ritu, Lal's young wife, is an epileptic and he slowly, but surely, endears himself to Anne to whom he is attracted. Anne befriends Chid (Charles McCaughan), an American charlatan posing as a sanyasi and a would-be convert to Hindu mysticism. Chid tries to seduce Anne with his antics, but she firmly rebuffs his sexual advances while becoming closer to Inder Lal. Eventually, Anne invites Lal into her bed. Things get complicated for Olivia when she gets pregnant. She informs Douglas and the Nawab about it. Both men welcome the news. Douglas, unaware of his wife's infidelity, wishes for a son as blond as he is. The Nawab does not doubt that he is the father and he is overjoyed. He is in the midst of being deposed by the British, and views having a mixed-race heir as the ultimate revenge. Suspecting that the Nawab is the child's father, Olivia has an abortion in secret with Harry and the Begum's help, pretending to have a miscarriage. However, Olivia continues bleeding and is admitted to the hospital, where Dr. Saunders immediately discovers her ruse. Olivia runs away from the hospital early in the morning, eloping with the Nawab to Kashmir. She leaves Douglas broken-hearted, though he eventually remarries. Like Olivia, Anne gets pregnant and she also decides to get an abortion but backs down at the last minute. The Indian diet makes Chid fall sick and he returns to the United States. Anne also leaves behind the heat and dust of Satipur. She travels to the snowy mountains of Kashmir where Olivia spent her last years in solitude, seldom visited by the Nawab. Anne plans to bear her child in a hospital nearby.",

    "Synopsis": "A young man, Norbert, enters his father's study to claim his monthly allowance. His father obliges, but Norbert presses for more, citing a debt he owes a schoolmate. The father dismisses him, and an appeal to his mother fails. Norbert tries to pawn his watch to a friend, who instead gives him a forged 500-franc note. The boys take the counterfeit to a photo shop and use it to purchase a picture frame. When the store's co-manager finds out, he scolds his partner for her gullibility. She chides him in return for having accepted two forged notes the previous week. He then decides to pass off all three forged notes at the next opportunity. He uses them to pay Yvon for delivering heating oil. Yvon tries to pay his restaurant tab with the forged notes, but the waiter recognizes them as counterfeit. Yvon is arrested, and the photo shop people lie at his court trial. Yvon avoids jail time, but he loses his job. One of the owners of the photo shop recognizes Norbert on the street with a group of his school friends, and she approaches the school authorities and complains to them about him. When the Chaplain quizzes some of the students about the counterfeit bills, Norbert leaves the classroom. At home, his mother advises him to deny everything, and she goes to the photo shop with a bribe for the owners to let the matter rest. Lucien, the photo shop assistant who committed perjury for his employers at the trial by refusing to recognize Yvon, is revealed to have been marking up prices while his employers are out of the shop and pocketing the difference. His scam is discovered, and he is fired, but he keeps a copy of the shop's keys. He and two friends rob the shop's safe and begin an ATM card skimming operation. In need of money, Yvon acts for a friend as the driver of a getaway car for bank robbers. The police foil the robbery and arrest Yvon, who is tried and sentenced to three years in prison. While there, Yvon learns of his daughter's death and his wife's decision to start a new life without him. He unsuccessfully attempts suicide. Lucien and his accomplices are eventually arrested, and Lucien is sent to the same prison as Yvon. Lucien offers to include Yvon in a prison break attempt, but Yvon refuses. Yvon blames Lucien for his troubles and wants revenge. Lucien proceeds with his escape plan, but Yvon and his cellmate hear commotion in the hallway that indicates that Lucien has been caught. Yvon's cellmate speculates that Lucien will probably be transferred to a more severe maximum-security prison. After being released from prison, Yvon murders and robs a pair of hotel keepers. He is taken in by a kind woman over the objection of her father. Some time passes, and one night Yvon kills them along with others in their house with an axe. He goes to a café, confesses to a police officer, and is arrested.",

    "film_title": "Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence",
    "Synopsis": "In 1942, Captain Yonoi is the commander of the POW camp in Lebak Sembada in Japanese-occupied Java. A strict adherent to the bushido code, his only connection to the prisoners are the empathetic Lieutenant-Colonel John Lawrence, the only inmate fluent in Japanese, and the abrasive spokesman Group Captain Hicksley, who repeatedly resists Yonoi's attempts to find weapons experts among the prisoners. Lawrence has befriended Sergeant Gengo Hara but remains at odds with the rest of the staff. Summoned to the military trial of the recently captured Major Jack Celliers, Yonoi is fascinated by his resilience and has him interned at the camp. Yonoi confides in Lawrence that he is haunted with shame due to his absence during the February 26 Incident, believing he should have died alongside the rebels, implying his focus on honour stems from this. Sensing a kindred spirit in Celliers, Yonoi's fascination grows into a romantic obsession. When the inmates are made to fast as punishment for insubordination during the forced seppuku of a guard, Celliers is caught sneaking them food. They discover a smuggled radio during the subsequent investigation, forcing Celliers and Lawrence to accept blame. Yonoi's batman, realizing the hold Celliers has on him, attempts to kill Celliers in his sleep that night, but fails after he wakes up and escapes, freeing Lawrence too. Yonoi catches Celliers and challenges him to a duel in exchange for his freedom, but Celliers refuses; the batman returns and kills himself for his failure, urging Yonoi to kill Celliers before his feelings overpower him. At the funeral, Lawrence learns that he and Celliers will be executed for the radio to preserve order in the camp. Enraged, he trashes the funeral altar and is forced back into his cell. That night, Celliers reveals to Lawrence that as a teenager, he betrayed his younger brother, long bullied for his hunchback, by refusing to spare him a humiliating and traumatizing initiation ritual at their boarding school. He describes the lifelong shame it caused, paralleling Yonoi's predicament. The pair are released by a drunken Hara after another prisoner confesses to delivering the radio. As they leave, Hara calls out in English, \"Merry Christmas, Lawrence!\" Although angry at Hara for exceeding his authority, Yonoi only mildly reprimands him. Realizing that Yonoi wants to replace him with Celliers as spokesman, Hicksley confronts him and they argue about withholding information from each other. Enraged, Yonoi orders the whole camp to form up outside the barracks, including the sick bay's ailing patients, resulting in one's death. Hicksley, who refused to bring out the patients, is to be executed on the spot for his insubordination but before he can be killed, Celliers breaks rank and kisses Yonoi on each cheek. Caught between a desire for vindication and his feelings for Celliers, a distraught Yonoi collapses and is relieved of duty. The guards beat Celliers and drag him away. His sterner replacement has Celliers buried in the sand up to his neck. Yonoi sneaks into his pen and cuts a lock from his hair, moments before his death. Four years later, Lawrence visits Hara, now a prisoner of the Allies. Hara has learned English and reveals he'll be executed the following day for war crimes. Expressing confusion over the harshness of his sentence given how commonplace his actions were among both sides of the war, he and Lawrence conclude that while the Allies officially won, morally \"we are all wrong.\" They reminisce about Celliers and Yonoi, the latter of whom was reported to have been killed after the war, before bidding each other goodbye. As he is leaving, Hara calls out, \"Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence!\".",

    "film_title": "Monty Python's The Meaning of Life",
    "Synopsis": "Six fish in a restaurant's tank greet each other, then see their friend Howard Katzenburg being eaten. This leads them to question the meaning of life. In the first sketch, \"The Miracle of Birth\", maternity doctors ignore a woman in labour while trying to impress the hospital's administrator. In Yorkshire, a Roman Catholic man is made redundant from his job, and informs his numerous children that he must sell them for scientific experiments. A Protestant man looks on disapprovingly and proudly remarks that Protestants can use contraception and have sex for pleasure (although his wife observes that they never do). In \"Growth and Learning\", the Headmaster teaches a class of boys about school etiquette, then about sexual foreplay in a sex education lesson, which requires the boys to watch the Headmaster demonstrate having coitus on a four-poster bed with his unclothed, topless wife, Helen. One boy laughs and as punishment is forced to play in a violent rugby match that afternoon pitting pupils against the masters. \"Fighting Each Other\" features three scenes concerning the British military. First, during the Battle of the Somme in World War I, a British officer tries to rally his men during an attack, but they instead present him with going-away gifts. Second, a modern army RSM bullies his soldiers to say what they would rather be doing than marching drills, then dismisses each in turn. Lastly, in 1879 during the Anglo-Zulu War during the Battle of Rorke's Drift, a soldier finds his leg has been bitten off. Suspecting a tiger, the soldiers hunt for it and find two men in a tiger costume. The scene is interupted by a gurning Zulu, who uses his nose piercing to unzip a skin bodysuit revealing an announcer who introduces \"The Middle of the Film,\" during which bizarre characters challenge the audience in a segment called \"Find the Fish.\" \"Middle Age\" involves an American couple visiting a Hawaiian restaurant with a medieval torture theme, where, to the interest of the fish, the waiter offers a conversation about philosophy and the meaning of life. The customers are unable to make sense of it and move on to a discussion of live organ transplants. In \"Live Organ Transplants\", two paramedics visit an organ donor and remove his liver while he is alive. His wife is reluctant to donate her liver, but she relents after a man steps out of a refrigerator and reminds her of humanity's insignificance in the universe. Executives of an American conglomerate debate the meaning of life before a raid by The Crimson Permanent Assurance briefly interrupts them. \"The Autumn Years\" starts with a musician in a French restaurant singing about the joys of having a penis. As the song ends, the ill-tempered glutton Mr. Creosote enters the restaurant, causing the fish to scatter and hide. He vomits continually and devours an enormous meal. After the maître d'hôtel persuades him to eat an after-dinner mint, Creosote's gut explodes, splattering the other diners. In \"The Meaning of Life\", the restaurant's cleaning woman proposes that life is meaningless before revealing that she is a racist. A waiter leads the audience to the house where he was born, recalls his mother's lessons about kindness, and then becomes angry when his point trails off. \"Death\" features a condemned man choosing the manner of his own execution: being chased off the Cliffs of Dover by topless women in sports gear and falling into his own grave below. In a short animated sequence, despondent leaves commit suicide by throwing themselves from the branches of a tree. The Grim Reaper enters an isolated home and convinces the hosts and dinner guests, with difficulty, that they are all dead. They accompany the Grim Reaper to Heaven, revealed to be the Hawaiian restaurant from earlier. They enter a Las Vegas-style hotel where they meet the characters from the previous sketches, and a Tony Bennett-esque singer begins to sing about how amazing life is where it is always Christmas and various commercial items that can be bought in Heaven are there. The song abruptly ends for \"The End of the Film\". The hostess from \"The Middle of the Film\" opens an envelope and blandly reveals the meaning of life:",

    "Synopsis": "The Russian writer Andrei Gorchakov travels to Italy to research the life of 18th-century Russian composer Pavel Sosnovsky, who lived there and died by suicide after his return to Russia. He and his comely interpreter Eugenia travel to a convent in the Tuscan countryside, to look at frescoes by Piero della Francesca. Andrei decides at the last minute that he does not want to enter. Back at their hotel Andrei feels displaced and longs to go back to Russia, but unnamed circumstances seem to get in the way. Eugenia is smitten with Andrei and is offended that he will not sleep with her, claiming that she has a better boyfriend waiting for her. Andrei meets and befriends a strange man named Domenico, who is famous in the village for trying to cross through the waters of a mineral pool with a lit candle. He claims that when finally achieving it, he will save the world. They both share a feeling of alienation from their surroundings. Andrei later learns that Domenico used to live in a lunatic asylum until the post-fascistic state closed them; Domenico now lives in the street. He also learns that Domenico had a family and was obsessed in keeping them inside his house in order to save them from the end of the world, until they were freed by the local police after seven years. Before leaving, Domenico gives Andrei his candle and asks him if he will cross the waters with the candle for him. During a dream-like sequence, Andrei sees himself as Domenico and has visions of his wife, Eugenia, and Mary, mother of Jesus as being all one and the same. Andrei seems to cut his research short and plans to leave for Russia, until he gets a call from Eugenia, who wishes to say goodbye and tell him that she met Domenico in Rome by chance and that he asked if Andrei has walked across the pool himself as he promised. Andrei says he has, although that is not true. Eugenia is with her boyfriend, but he seems uninterested in her and appears to be involved in dubious business affairs. Later, Domenico delivers a speech on top the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius on the Capitoline Hill about the need of mankind of being true brothers and sisters and to return to a simpler way of life. Finally, he plays the fourth movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and immolates himself. An onlooker imitates the action of him writhing on the ground in agony, while Eugenia arrives too late, along with the police. Meanwhile, Andrei returns to the mineral pool in Bagno Vignoni (Val d'Orcia) to fulfill his promise, only to find that the pool has been drained. He enters the empty pool and repeatedly attempts to walk from one end to the other without letting the candle extinguish, as he experiences signs of his illness. When he finally achieves his goal, he collapses and dies. The final shot shows Andrei and a dog resting on the ground of Abbey of San Galgano, with a countryside with Gorchakov's house in the background.",

Her mysterious demeanor and overt sensuality quickly attract attention and speculation among the local residents. Unbeknownst to those around her, Elle is consumed by a desire to avenge the rape of her mother, which occurred years earlier at the hands of three men who had arrived at their remote home under the pretense of delivering a piano. The trauma left a lasting imprint on both mother and daughter. Elle becomes involved with a shy local car mechanic (Alain Souchon), whose gentleness contrasts with her internal turmoil. However, her perception of him changes drastically when she learns that his deceased father, an Italian immigrant, had once owned the same piano involved in the assault. Believing this connection implicates his family, Elle misdirects her anger toward them. As she delves deeper into her quest for vengeance, Elle’s mental state deteriorates. Eventually, she discovers that her suspicions were unfounded: the men she believed responsible were innocent, and her father had already avenged the crime years earlier. This revelation proves overwhelming, leading to her institutionalization. Unaware of the full truth, the mechanic misinterprets the situation. Believing the accused men to be guilty and responsible for Elle's breakdown, he seeks them out and kills them, culminating in a tragic and misguided act of retribution.",

    "Synopsis": "Washed-up, alcoholic country singer Mac Sledge awakens at a run-down Texas roadside motel and gas station after a night of heavy drinking. He meets the owner, a young widow named Rosa Lee, and offers to perform maintenance work there in exchange for a room. Rosa, whose husband died in the Vietnam War, is raising her young son, Sonny, on her own. She agrees to let Mac stay on condition that he does not drink while working. During quiet evenings, they sit alone and share parts of their life stories. Mac resolves to give up alcohol and start his life anew. After enough days of keeping his word and doing his work, he is comfortable enough in his new life that he and Rosa Lee wed. They start attending a Baptist church on a regular basis. A newspaper reporter eventually visits the motel and asks Mac whether he has stopped recording music and if he has deliberately chosen to lead an anonymous life. When Mac refuses to answer, the reporter explains he is writing a story about him and has interviewed his ex-wife, Dixie Scott, a country music star who is performing nearby. After the story is published, the neighbourhood learns of Mac's past, and members of a local country–western band visit him to show their respect. Despite greeting them politely, Mac remains reluctant to open up about his past. Later, he secretly attends Dixie's concert. She passionately sings songs that Mac wrote years earlier, and he leaves in the middle of the performance. Backstage, he talks to Dixie's manager, his old friend, Harry. Mac gives him a copy of a new song he has written and asks him to show it to Dixie. Mac tries to talk to Dixie, who becomes angry on seeing him and warns him to stay away from their 18-year-old daughter, Sue Anne. Upon returning home, Mac assures Rosa Lee he no longer has any feelings for Dixie. Later, Harry visits Mac to tell him, seemingly at Dixie's urging, that the country music business has changed and his new song is no good. Hurt and angry, Mac drives away and nearly crashes the truck. He buys a bottle of whiskey but, returning home to a worried Rosa Lee and Sonny, he tells them he poured it out. He says he tried to leave Rosa Lee, but found he could not. Mac and Sonny are later baptised together in Rosa Lee's church. Eventually, Sue Anne visits Mac—their first encounter since she was a baby. Mac asks whether she got any of his letters, and she says her mother kept them from her. She also reports that Dixie tried to keep her from visiting Mac, and that, despite her mother's objections, she is eloping with her boyfriend. Mac admits that he used to hit Dixie and that she divorced him after he tried to kill her in a drunken rage. Sue Anne asks whether Mac remembers a song about a dove he sang to her when she was a baby. He claims he does not, but after she leaves, he sings to himself the hymn \"On the Wings of a Dove\". Boys at school bully Sonny about his dead father. Meanwhile, the members of the local country band ask Mac permission to perform one of his songs, and he agrees. Mac begins performing with them and they make plans to record together. His newfound happiness is interrupted when Sue Anne dies in a car accident. Mac attends his daughter's funeral at Dixie's lavish home in Nashville and comforts her when she breaks down. Back home, Mac keeps quiet about his emotional pain, but wonders aloud to Rosa Lee why his once sorry existence has been given meaning and, on the other hand, his daughter has died. Throughout his mourning, Mac continues his new life with Rosa Lee and Sonny. Sonny eventually finds a football that Mac has left as a gift for him. Mac is watching the motel from a field across the road, singing the hymn to himself. Sonny thanks him for the football and the two play catch together as Rosa Lee watches them through a window.",

    "Synopsis": "Rupert Pupkin is a delusional stand-up comedian unsuccessfully trying to launch his career. After meeting Jerry Langford, a successful comedian and talk-show host, Rupert believes that his \"big break\" has finally come. He attempts to book a spot on the show but is continually rebuffed by Langford's staff and finally by Langford himself. Along the way, Rupert indulges in elaborate and obsessive fantasies in which he and Langford are colleagues and friends. Hoping to impress, Rupert arrives uninvited at Langford's country home with a date, Rita. Returning to his house from playing golf, Langford finds Rupert and Rita settling in. Angered, Langford launches into a furious tirade against Rupert, telling him that his act is mediocre and that he is a lunatic who will never amount to anything. An embarrassed Rita convinces Rupert to leave. Desperate, Rupert enlists Masha, a fellow stalker similarly obsessed with Langford. Together, they kidnap and hold Langford hostage in Masha's parents' Manhattan townhouse. As ransom, Rupert demands that he be given the opening spot on that evening's The Jerry Langford Show, and that the show be broadcast as normal (with Tony Randall as guest host). The network brass and the FBI agree to his demands, with the understanding that Langford will be released immediately after the show airs. Between the taping of the show and the broadcast, Masha has her \"dream date\" with Langford, who is duct-taped to a chair. Langford convinces her to untie him and escapes. Rupert's stand-up routine is well received by the audience. In his act, he describes his troubled life while simultaneously laughing at his circumstances. Rupert closes by confessing to the studio audience that he kidnapped Jerry Langford to break into show business. The audience laughs, believing it to be part of his act. Rupert responds by saying, \"Tomorrow you'll know I wasn't kidding, and you'll all think I'm crazy. But I figure it this way: better to be king for a night than a schmuck for a lifetime.\" News reports of Rupert's phenomenal success at comedy, as well as his prison sentence and release, play over a montage of his performances, and of storefronts stocking his \"long-awaited\" autobiography King For a Night. Reports state that Rupert still considers Jerry Langford to be his mentor and friend, and that he and his agent are currently weighing several \"attractive offers\", including comedy tours and a film adaptation of his memoirs. In the end, Rupert takes the stage for an apparent TV special with a live audience and an announcer enthusiastically introducing, lavishly praising, and giving him extended applause.",

    "Synopsis": "The film starts in one of the new towns of Latina with the birth of Piera, daughter of the somewhat unbalanced Eugenia and her apparently sane husband Lorenzo, who has a job with the PCI. Eugenia's behaviour at home and in public becomes increasingly erratic and when on top of this Lorenzo loses his post, the strain puts him into a mental hospital. Piera leaves school to work for a dressmaker and pursues her dream of acting, eventually breaking into television and theatre. Interleaved with her outside life we see her sexual development, from kissing neighbourhood boys to a lesbian relationship while she is in hospital with breathing problems and finally to adult men. While Piera is maturing as a woman and as an actress, Eugenia is deteriorating and has to be locked away. The film ends with Piera taking her mother out for the day to a deserted beach, where the two women undress and hug each other tightly in a moment of natural tenderness.",

    "Synopsis": "Guy Hamilton, a novice foreign correspondent for an Australian radio network, arrives in Jakarta on assignment. He meets the close-knit members of the foreign correspondent community, including journalists from the UK, the US, and New Zealand; diplomatic personnel; and Billy Kwan, a photo-journalist and outlier in the journalist community. A Chinese-Australian man with dwarfism, high intelligence, and moral seriousness, Kwan is deeply involved with and concerned for the people of Jakarta and their tribulations, even regularly providing for a destitute woman and her young son. Guy is initially unsuccessful as a journalist because his predecessor, tired of life in Indonesia, had departed without introducing Guy to his contacts. He receives limited sympathy from the journalist community, which competes for scraps of information from Sukarno's regime, the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), and the conservative, Muslim-dominated Indonesian military. However, Billy takes a liking to Guy and arranges interviews for him with key political figures. Billy introduces Guy to Jill Bryant, a beautiful young assistant at the British Embassy. Billy and Jill are close friends, yet Billy subtly manipulates her encounters with Guy. Since she is returning to the UK shortly, Jill initially resists Guy's attentions, but eventually they fall in love. When Jill discovers that the Chinese communists are arming the PKI in preparation for civil war, she passes this information to Guy, informing him that all foreigners will be in danger. She advises him to leave the country, but he uses the information to write about the communist rebellion that will occur when the arms shipment reaches Jakarta. Upset with Guy's lack of discretion and concerned it will lead back to Jill as the informant, Billy and Jill cut off contact with Guy; he is left with the American journalist Pete Curtis and his own assistant and driver Kumar, who is secretly a member of the PKI. Kumar, however, remains loyal to Guy, and tries to open his eyes to all that is going on. After the boy Billy had been caring for becomes ill and dies, Billy becomes despondent and disillusioned over Sukarno's failure to meet the needs of the Indonesian people. He hangs a banner with \"Sukarno feed your people\" from the Hotel Indonesia to express his outrage, but he is thrown from the window by security men and dies in Guy's arms. His death is also witnessed by Jill. Still pursuing his civil war scoop, Guy attempts to access the presidential palace where, having learned of the communist shipment, the army generals have taken over and unleashed executions. Struck down by an army officer, Guy suffers a serious eye injury. Resting alone in Billy's bungalow, Guy recalls a passage from the Bhagavad Gita, \"all is clouded by desire\", which Billy had recited to him. Kumar visits him and tells him about the failed coup attempt. Risking permanent damage to his eye, a bandaged Guy implores Kumar to drive him to the airport, where he boards the last plane out of Jakarta and is reunited with Jill.",

    "Synopsis": "The setting is a public school, modelled on Eton and Winchester, in the 1930s. Guy Bennett and Tommy Judd are pupils and, because they are both outsiders in their own ways, friends (Bennett is gay while Judd is a Marxist). One day, a teacher walks in on a pupil, Martineau, and a boy from another house engaged in mutual masturbation. Martineau subsequently hangs himself, as teachers and the senior pupils try their hardest to keep the scandal away from parents and the outside world. The scandal, however, gives the army-obsessed house captain, Fowler, a welcome reason to scheme against Bennett. Fowler dislikes him and Judd and wants to stop Bennett from becoming a \"God\" – a school title for the two top prefects. Fowler is able to intercept a love note from Bennett to James Harcourt. Bennett agrees to be punished with a caning so as not to compromise Harcourt; on earlier occasions, he had avoided punishment by blackmailing the other \"Lords\" with the threat that he would reveal their own experiences with him. Meanwhile, Judd is reluctant to become a prefect, since he feels that he cannot endorse a \"system of oppression\". He makes a bitter speech about how the boys oppressed by the system grow up to be the fathers who maintain it. Eventually, however, he agrees to become a prefect in order to prevent Fowler from becoming Head of House. This never comes about because another pupil, Donald Devenish, agrees to stay at school and become a prefect if he is nominated to become a God instead of Bennett. Devastated at the loss of his cherished dream of becoming a God, Bennett comes to realise that the British class system strongly relies on outward appearance and that to be openly gay is a severe hindrance to his intended career as a diplomat. The film's epilogue says that Bennett defected to Russia later in his life, after having been a spy for the Soviet Union. Judd died fighting in the Spanish Civil War.",

    "Synopsis": "Cal is a young member of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) in 1970s Northern Ireland. He acts as a driver on a nighttime murder of a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), which takes place at the victim's home in view of his father, who is also shot. One year later, Cal learns that a librarian, Marcella, to whom he is attracted, is a Catholic and the widow of the victim. Cal wants to leave the IRA, but is pressured to remain. He and his father live in the city, where they feel threatened by Orange Order marches and are harassed by Loyalist gangs. Cal is offered work in Marcella's Protestant husband's family farm, where she lives. Initially he works as a hand and, after he and his father are burned out, moves to a semi-derelict cottage on the farm, without telling the IRA his new location. Marcella is unhappy, feeling suffocated by her domineering mother-in-law and sick father-in-law. Marcella confesses that her marriage was not a happy one. Over time, Cal and Marcella begin a love affair—with Marcella unaware of Cal's role in her husband's death. While Christmas shopping for Marcella and her child, he is abducted by the IRA, who are unwilling for him to leave them. The car is stopped at a British Army checkpoint and tries to get away. In the ensuing crash, Cal escapes and makes his way to Marcella's home, where he declares his love for her and hints at his involvement in her husband's murder. He has been pursued to the house by the RUC and is arrested and taken away.",

    "Synopsis": "thumb|left|A snapshot from film The story is set in 1907 on the estate of the rich and influential Bengali noble Nikhilesh \"Nikhil\" Choudhary (Victor Banerjee) in Sukhsayar. In the chaotic aftermath of Lord Curzon's partition of Bengal into Muslim and Hindu states, the Swadeshi movement is trying to impose a boycott of foreign goods by claiming that imports are at the root of Indian poverty. Nikhilesh was the first in his family to receive a Western education and he has modern views. He married Bimala (Swatilekha Sengupta). He appointed Miss Gilby to teach his wife Bimala Piano and English songs. He lives happily with his wife Bimala and his widowed sister-in-law until the appearance of his friend, a revolutionist and a strong supporter of the Swadeshi movement, Sandip (Soumitra Chatterjee). Sandip comes to Sukhsayar to convince Nikhilesh and the villagers to renounce foreign goods in exchange for the Swadeshi ones. Sandip, a passionate and active man, is a contradiction to the peace-loving and somewhat passive Nikhilesh. Nikhilesh introduces him to his wife Bimala. However, Sandip feels infatuated with Bimala. He insists she meets him daily and decided to stay in Nikhilesh's bungalow. He easily attracts innocent and unsuspecting Bimala. Meanwhile, Miss Gilby is hit by a student who was associated with the Swadeshi movement when she was returning from the Church. Because of this, she decides to leave Sukhsayar. Although Nikhilesh figures out what is happening between Sandip and Bimala through his sister-in-law and close associates, he is mature and grants Bimala the freedom to grow and explore what she wants in life, as their marriage was arranged when she was a girl. Further, Nikhilesh tells Bimala that he would like her to have a life not only inside the home but outside of it as well — a controversial stance in 1916 when the novel was written. Sandip convinces Bimala to support the Swadeshi movement and urges her to convince Nikhilesh too about the movement who is against the Swadeshi movement because it is not affordable for the poor. According to Nikhilesh, poor people can't afford the movement because foreign goods are cheap and have better quality than the Swadeshi ones and they would suffer if foreign goods are banned. Thus, he doesn't ban foreign goods in Sukhsayar. Although Sandip doesn't concede defeat and starts to make some sinister plan when local poor Muslim tenants also refused to stop buying and selling foreign goods. He creates groups that would often snatch foreign items from the local Muslim traders and bribe the local administrator to sink the boats carrying the foreign goods in Sukhsayar. This results in the growing hatred between Hindus and Muslims. Muslim preachers from other areas started to take benefit of these problems between Hindus and Muslims of Sukhsayar and started to preach hatred to poor Muslim peasants against Hindus. Sandip demands money from Bimala for the Swadeshi cause. Unsuspecting Bimala gives him the required money but found later that he had demanded more money than required. She also found that he is creating problems in Sukhsayar. Bimala ultimately realizes that it is indeed her husband Nikhilesh who actually loves her rather than Sandip. She regrets her actions in front of Nikhilesh who forgives her. In Sukhsayar, riots broke out between Muslims and Hindus. Nikhilesh decides to go himself and stop the riots between the two groups. Meanwhile, Sandip leaves Sukhsayar by train as soon as he hears about the riots. In the morning, to the horror of Bimala and all the people close to Nikhilesh, Nikhilesh is found dead and Bimala becomes a widow.",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- MOS:FILMPLOT advises plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. Please do not expand this section any further. Please do not remove this message. --> Travis Henderson is wandering through the West Texas desert holding an empty gallon water jug. He wanders into a convenience store, opens a freezer, starts eating ice, and faints. A doctor examines Travis and believes that he is mute. The doctor goes through Travis's wallet and finds a card with a phone number on it. He calls the number and reaches Walt Henderson, Travis's brother. Walt travels from Los Angeles to Terlingua, Texas, to pick up Travis, whom he had presumed dead after not hearing from him for four years. Walt's wife, Anne, is worried since she and Walt have adopted Travis's son, Hunter, as Hunter's biological mother, Jane, had been out of his life for years. Walt finds Travis wandering miles down the road from the clinic. The brothers begin their trip back to Los Angeles. Walt grows increasingly frustrated with Travis's muteness and confronts him about his disappearance and abandonment of Hunter. At the mention of Hunter, Travis begins to cry but still does not speak. The next day, Travis finally begins to speak and produces a photo of a plot of land, explaining that he purchased a property in Paris, Texas. The brothers arrive in Los Angeles, where Walt and Anne live in the Verdugo Hills overlooking the Burbank Airport. There Travis reunites with Hunter, who has little recollection of him and is initially timid around him. Walt shows Hunter old home videos of them and Jane, and, after persistence by Travis, Hunter grows comfortable around his father. Anne tells Travis in confidence that Jane wires monthly payments from a particular Houston bank into an account set up for Hunter. Anne pays particular attention to Travis, often seeking his attention around the house. Travis becomes determined to find Jane and tells Hunter that he must leave the next night. Hunter tells Travis that he wants to accompany him, though they do not have Walt's or Anne's permission. Travis and Hunter leave for Houston, and grow closer. They arrive at the bank on the day of the expected deposit and watch for Jane. Hunter spots her making a drive-in deposit, and they follow her car to a peep show club where she works. Travis goes inside while Hunter waits in the car. The peep show is designed so that customers sit on one side of a one-way mirror with a telephone intercom to the performer. When Jane enters the room, Travis becomes angry and berates her, then apologizes and leaves. The next day, Travis leaves Hunter in a hotel room and goes to Jane's workplace. In Jane's room, he turns his chair so it faces away from her. On the phone, he tells her a vague story about a man and a younger woman who met, quickly fell in love with each other, got married, and had a child. Jane is initially confused but soon realizes that it is Travis. He tells her that after the child was born, the wife became irritable and enraged, and yearned for an escape. She would have dreams about running naked down a highway, but just as she was about to finally leave, he would appear and stop her. The now-alcoholic husband, fearing his wife's departure, tied a cowbell to her foot so he would be able to hear if she left in the night. On one night, the wife—having stuffed socks in the cowbell to muffle the sound—successfully snuck out, but the husband caught her and dragged her back home. He tied her to a stove with his belt and went to bed. When he woke up, the house was on fire, and the wife and child were gone. Jane turns the light off on her side and finally sees Travis. She expresses pain and regret over missing Hunter's childhood. Travis tells Jane that Hunter is waiting for her in a hotel room and gives her the room number. Jane and Hunter reunite while Travis watches from the parking lot. Travis drives away, crying.",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- WP:FILMPLOT recommends the plot summary to be between 400-700 words. --> The court of inquiry of Commanding Lieutenant William Bligh for the loss of Bounty to mutineers begins. Via flashbacks, Bounty sets out from Portsmouth on 23 December 1787, on an expedition to Tahiti to gather breadfruit pods for transplantation in the Caribbean; Bligh electing to sail the ship west round the tip of South America to fulfill a lifelong ambition to circumnavigate the globe. After thirty-one days, the attempt to round Cape Horn fails due to harsh weather, and the ship is obliged to take the longer eastern route. Bligh promotes his friend Fletcher Christian. The ship's alcoholic surgeon, Thomas Huggan, escapes punishment for killing a man in a botched operation. Arriving in Tahiti in October 1788, Bligh finds that due to the delays, the wind is against them for a quick return journey, and they must stay on the island for four months longer than planned. Many of the weary crew, relieved to land, eventually develop a taste for the pleasures that island life offers, especially the native women; Christian immerses himself in Tahitian culture, making his relationship with Bligh tense. Three crew members, including the popular Charles Churchill, desert rather than be forced to leave the island. Bligh hunts the men down and has them flogged. Huggan is found dead after excessive drinking. When the ship departs Tahiti, Fletcher is forced to leave his pregnant native lover, Mauatua, behind. Bligh tightens shipboard discipline in response to the desertion attempt. He insists that the ship is filthy and orders the crew to clean it several times a day, hands out more arbitrary chores, and limits rations. Many of the men, including Christian, are singled out for tongue-lashings, especially when he dares suggest to Bligh that they should go around Cape Horn again. Christian considers constructing a raft to escape; playing on his resentment against Bligh's treatment of both him and the men, midshipman Ned Young persuades Christian to take the Bounty by force. When Bligh again dismisses his concerns, Christian has the captain roused from his bed and taken to the deck. There, Bligh and those loyal to him are forced into a longboat, minimally supplied, and cast adrift. Following an incident where natives on the island of Tonfa kill one of their number, Bligh and his crew agree to try to reach the Dutch East Indies. Forced to restrain his arrogant personality, Bligh's leadership and resourcefulness enable the remaining loyalists to reach safety. Christian and the mutineers sail back to Tahiti. King Tynah, however, is concerned that their mutiny could incite British punishment against his people. Realizing the folly of staying, the mutineers get permission to collect food and take their lovers with them. Christian pleads with Tynah to allow his daughter to decide her own destiny. Tynah concedes, and Mauatua chooses the uncertainty of a life with Christian over remaining with her father. Churchill and several others force Christian to leave them behind as he tries to find a safe haven where the Royal Navy cannot find the mutineers. After suppressing another attempted mutiny, Christian finds Pitcairn Island, a place not marked on British maps of the region. As the crew burn the Bounty to cover their tracks, seaman John Adams muses to Christian that they will never see England again. The judgement of Bligh's court-martial is read by Admiral Hood: Bligh is exonerated of all blame of the loss of the Bounty and receives a commendation for courage and exemplary seamanship. Bligh sheathes his sword with a slight tremor, thanks Hood and departs. A resigned Christian watches Bounty sink.",

    "Synopsis": "The film opens with Detective Fisher, a European expatriate in Cairo, undergoing hypnosis to process his most recent case, with the remainder of the film narrated by him in a dreamlike state. Expressionistic and surreal, the Europe of Fisher's hypnotized recollection is a psychosocial dystopia, dark, decaying, desolate, and rain drenched. Chief Inspector Kramer has asked Fisher to return to Europe to investigate a serial killer who has been strangling and mutilating young girls. Osborne, Fisher's former but now disgraced mentor, had closed the case three years before, after the suspect, Harry Grey, supposedly died in a car crash with Osborne in pursuit. But now, there has been a new murder with the same MO. Visiting Osborne, Fisher is bothered to learn that Osborne now disowns the set of crime-solving techniques he invented, controversial in the department, but which Fisher considers genius. Fisher intends to vindicate Osborne's techniques by solving the murders. Osborne's techniques involve simulating the life of the criminal as closely as possible, in order to understand the inner workings of his mind. Retrieving an old tailing report describing Grey's journey between several cities, which Osborne had ordered burned, Fisher sets off to repeat Grey's journey. In the first city, Fisher meets a prostitute, Kim, who he asks to simulate Grey's fiancé, who accompanied him on the trip according to the tailing report. Throughout the journey, Fisher keeps the same hotel rooms as Grey, wears Grey's clothing, and attempts to simulate his personality. He even has Kim painfully wrap strings around his head, to simulate Grey's frequent headaches. By thinking like Grey, Fisher is able to discover a new body, and to predict the time and place of the next murder. He also learns that Kim had a child with Grey, who Fisher had seen earlier at Osborne's home. Fisher's prediction of the time and place of the next murder turns out to be accurate, as a young girl is soon contacted by a man claiming to be Harry Grey. Kramer's police force sets up a sting operation to capture Grey using the girl as bait. But instead of protecting the girl, Fisher separates her from Kramer, and strangles her himself. The true killer is Osborne: Grey really died in the car chase, but having successfully entered Grey's mind across the course of his own investigation, Osborne also acquired his murderous compulsions, and continued Grey's plans. Having replicated Osborne's techniques, the same thing has happened to Fisher. Osborne hangs himself after writing a confession claiming responsibility for the murders, including the one committed by Fisher. Over Osborne's body, Kim and Fisher exchange knowing glances. Fisher tells the hypnotist, \"You can wake me up now,\" but hears no response.",

    "Synopsis": "Paco and Régula live on a rural estate owned by an absent marchioness. Among them live their three children: Nieves works as a maid in the big house; Quirce is doing his military service; and their youngest daughter Charito is severely handicapped and confined to a crib. The family is joined by Régula's mentally handicapped brother Azarías, sacked from another estate, who loves birds. Daily life in the cortijo is shown in painstaking detail and displays an oppressive routine based on a rigid hierarchy. At the top of this stratified system lie the aristocrats owning this and other cortijos, as well as the Francoist politicians and Church officials routinely visiting them. Rural middle classes are represented by the manager Pedro and his bored wife Pura. The house servants and modern-day serfs tending the land occupy the bottom level and are treated as subhuman beings by everyone else. In this toxic class system, members of every echelon feel entitled to humiliate those deemed their social inferiors. For instance, the owner's son, señorito Iván, often comes back to the estate to openly conduct an affair with Pura, and her knowing husband takes out his impotent rage on the labourers, particularly Azarías. Paco and Régula accept the repeated humiliations of their position as dependents at the whim of the owners and the estate manager, but Nieves and Quirce are less inured to this reality and aim for a better life. Besides his affair with Pedro's wife, another reason for Iván's visits is his fanatical love of fowling, and hunting parties are routinely organized in the area. Paco, whom he forces up a tree to decoy pigeons, falls and breaks a leg. Quirce briefly replaces Paco but his aloof demeanor vexes Iván, who is more accostumed to the servility of the young man's parents. When it becomes clear that Paco's leg will not heal in time for the next hunting party, Iván he tries using Azarías and, in a fit of pique during an unsuccessful hunt, shoots the man's pet jackdaw. Next time Azarías is sent up a tree to work decoys, he drops a noose round Ivan's neck and hangs him in retribution. His infantile mental age spares him legal prosecution (which in 1960s Spain would have entailed a lengthy prison sentence or even the death penalty) and he is committed to an asylum.",

In the morning, Yvonne returns to attempt reconciliation and they are joined by Geoffrey's half-brother, Hugh, who has recently returned from the Spanish Civil War. Hugh is a journalist, investigating a possible plot by the Germans.

The trio decides to visit by bus one of the twin volcanoes that rise above the town, Popocatépetl. They stop for brunch along the way at a restaurant that overlooks a bullfighting ring. At one point, Hugh jumps in and successfully uses a Muleta (the red capes) with a bull charging him. The crowd celebrates his bravado. Geoffrey finally says aloud the secret they have all avoided discussing, an affair between Yvonne and Hugh.

    "Synopsis": "Lance Hackett, a geologist for Ayers Mining Company, has identified a promising location to search for uranium in the Outback near Coober Pedy, South Australia. Explosives are to be used to analyze the \"geological substructure of the region\", so the local Aboriginal people block the work, as they claim the area is where the green ants dream, and that disturbing the ants will destroy humanity. Hackett finds himself the intermediary between his employer and the tribe, and becomes increasingly sympathetic to the indigenous worldview and cause. Baldwin Ferguson, an executive vice-president of Ayers, is unable to sway the tribal elders with either a trip to Melbourne or the gift of a large, green military airplane that they ask for. The case goes to trial, and the judge decides in favor of the mining company. Two of the tribal elders take to spending their days sitting in the airplane, and one, Dayipu, is in it when Watson, a younger member of the tribe who learned to fly in the air force, takes it up to prove he can. The plane does not have much fuel, and Watson, who is drunk, crashes in the hills. Ayers begins their work, drilling test holes and setting off small explosives, but Hackett quits and goes to live in an old water tank offered to him by another white man who was profoundly affected by studying the local Aboriginal culture.",

    "Synopsis": "In a 1960s working-class neighborhood in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a teenage boy nicknamed \"Birdy\" befriends his next-door neighbor Al Columbato, who relates to Birdy’s fascination with birds and their ability to fly. The two begin pursuing Birdy's hobby of catching pigeons and caging them in a large, wooden aviary that he has built outside his parents' home. One night, the teenagers climb on top of a refinery building, where Birdy hangs on the ledge to catch the pigeons roosting on it. Birdy loses his grip and falls several stories, but he lands on a pile of sand. Slightly dazed, he tells Al that during the fall, he flew. After Birdy is hospitalized for minor injuries, his parents dismantle the aviary. Birdy concedes to Al's wishes of pursuing another venture. After they purchase and restore a 1953 Ford automobile, Al's father registers the vehicle. Al drives Birdy to an Atlantic City boardwalk, but they are arrested the next day after Mr. Columbato reports the car stolen. After bailing the boys out of jail, Mr. Columbato sells the vehicle. Birdy later confronts him, claiming that the car was not his to sell. Mr. Columbato offers Birdy a sum of money, which Birdy refuses on principle. Birdy builds a new aviary in his bedroom and purchases two canaries. He names the female Perta and the male Alfonso (after his friend). Upon returning to school, Birdy encounters a classmate, Doris Robinson, and Al encourages him to ask her out on a date. At the prom, Birdy dances unenthusiastically with Doris, leaving her confused and humiliated. Afterwards, Doris drives him to a secluded spot, where Birdy lightly rejects her sexual advances. Birdy returns home to his bedroom and lies down naked in the aviary. In a semi-conscious state, he expresses that he wants to die and be born again as a bird. He then imagines himself flying like a bird around his room, throughout the house and outside in the neighborhood. Upon graduation, Al enlists and Birdy is drafted into the United States Army. During the Vietnam War, Birdy is placed in a mental hospital after being missing in action for a month. A flashback reveals that he was the sole survivor of a helicopter crash. Al is hospitalized in the same facility. His face is heavily bandaged for injuries that he sustained from an exploding bomb. Major Weiss, a military doctor, informs Al that, although Birdy's injuries are relatively minor, Birdy has not spoken since he was found. Al speaks to Birdy at length, but Al grows increasingly frustrated by his lack of response. He is then elated when Birdy smiles at a joke he makes. Weiss dismisses the response as dissociative behavior. Al suspects Birdy of feigning insanity to hide from the world, and he expresses to Birdy that he too wishes to hide due to his own injuries. Birdy unexpectedly responds by telling Al that he is \"full of shit\". Al alerts Weiss to Birdy's response, but when the doctor arrives, Birdy remains silent. Not seeing any progress, Weiss orders Al to leave, but Al pushes the doctor aside. After Weiss flees, two orderlies are sent in to subdue Al, who fights them and takes Birdy to the roof of the hospital. Birdy rushes to the ledge, raises his arms and jumps off the side of the roof as if he were about to fly. Thinking Birdy has plunged to severe injury, Al runs over to the ledge but finds Birdy on another level of the roof, perfectly fine. Birdy looks up at Al and says, \"What?\"",

    "film_title": "Colonel Redl",
    "Synopsis": "Alfred Redl, a Ruthenian boy from Galicia in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, wins an appointment to a prestigious military academy in spite of being the son of a mere peasant farmer. At his departure from home, his mother instils in him eternal gratitude towards Emperor Franz Josef. Redl is never to forget that he owes his promising career to the Emperor. At the military academy, the young Redl is punished along with a fellow cadet, Kristof Kubinyi, when the latter's wooden lance breaks as they are practicing fighting; as they are beaten while running the gauntlet, they put their arms around each other's bare shoulders. Redl soon stands out for his talent, drive and loyalty to the Crown. When one of his teachers demands that he say who played a practical joke, he at first refuses, but when the teacher says that if he stays silent Kubinyi will be expelled, he names a different student; whilst he blames himself for incriminating his comrade, Alfred soon realises that to rise in the ranks he must overcome his peasant background by ingratiating himself with his superiors. Alfred and Kristof become firm friends, and Kristof invites Redl home for the holidays to the elegant residence of his parents, who lead a life of privilege and nobility in Hungary. There, Alfred meets Kristof's pretty sister, Katalin, who welcomes him warmly. To Kubinyi's aristocratic parents, Redl hides his true humble background, pretending to be of Hungarian ancestry and a member from an old family who lost all its fortune. Redl and Kubinyi slowly climb the ladder as career officers. Once they become adults, the two friends have different political ideals. As a Hungarian, Kubinyi slowly falls prey to the national aspirations of a Hungary free from Habsburg rule, while Redl remains fiercely patriotic and faithful to his benefactor, the Austrian Emperor. For Redl, his relationship with Kubinyi goes beyond friendship as Redl harbors an unrequited love for his comrade. When the two young men visit a brothel, Redl seems more interested in watching his friend having sex than in engaging a woman in his own room. Redl suppresses his attraction to Kristof, however, and transfers it, as best he can, to Katalin, his friend's beautiful married sister. Back at the academy, Alfred serves as a second in a duel between Kristof and another classmate, who is killed in the contest. This foolishness jeopardizes the careers of both Kubinyi and Redl, but the commanding officer, Colonel von Roden, having noted Redl's hard work and loyalty to the Emperor, arranges a promotion for him and a prized assignment in Vienna. In Vienna, Redl is able to renew his friendship with Katalin, who is, by then, unhappily married. They become lovers in spite of Katalin knowing well that it is her brother who Alfred really loves. Redl is assigned to a garrison serving on the Russian border. The discipline there is lax and Redl readily stands out as a serious-minded young officer. When the district commander decides to retire, Redl is recommended for the position. As commanding officer, he proves very demanding, working hard to reinvigorate the discipline of his outfit. This does not sit well with the junior officers, including Kristof, especially because they feel superior to Redl by birth. When Redl and Kristof have a falling out over Kristof's sloppy habits and poor performance, Kristof mocks Redl's lowly origins in conversation with other officers. Colonel von Roden intervenes on Redl's behalf again, bringing him back to Vienna to serve as deputy chief of the counter-espionage branch of the Evidenzbureau. It's a nasty job, since it entails spying on officers throughout the Austro-Hungarian Army, trying to identify those engaging in espionage activities. On Katalin's suggestion, Redl undertakes a loveless marriage of convenience in order to quell rumors of his homosexual proclivities. His wife, Clarissa, suffers from ill health and remains a distant figure in his life. Redl's single-minded devotion to duty draws him into the orbit of the heir to the throne Archduke Franz Ferdinand Emperor's nephew, who is a ruthless schemer whose ultimate objective is portrayed as to overthrow the Emperor in a coup d'état. (This character is often assumed to be the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, but he is not named, and he is not biographically identical with any of the real archdukes; his politics \"most closely resemble those of the deceased Rudolf. ) Redl participates in one of the heir presumptive's plots, which involves setting up an aging Ukrainian officer for a dramatic fall so as to shake the army out of its complacency. The man is accidentally shot to death, however, during the search and seizure, negating the value of the plan. The heir to the throne then decides to make Redl the fall guy instead. Redl contributes to his own downfall by allowing himself to be seduced by an Italian officer and giving him military secrets to be passed to the Russians. The doomed Redl is arrested. It falls upon Kristof to provide him with a service pistol and order him to commit suicide. After experiencing anger, hesitation and despair, Redl finally shoots himself. The film ends with a brief depiction of the assassination of the Archduke at Sarajevo and the beginning of World War I.",

Henriette, the post office clerk, keeps trying to inveigle him, but he spends his evenings tending to mis mother's demands and spying on his three enemies: the lawyer Lavoisier, the doctor Morasseau, and the butcher Filiol, three leading citizens who have formed a syndicate to buy and develop Louis' house. As he and his mother refuse all offers from this unpleasant trio, the two are subject to continual harassment. One day when Filiol is particularly obnoxious, Louis puts sugar in the tank of his car during the night. A resulting accident kills the butcher and brings the police detective Lavardin to town. Not averse to beating and waterboarding suspects, he finds that the situation is considerably more complex than it originally seemed: the lawyer Lavoisier has a mistress, Anna, who is friendly with the doctor Morasseau's wife, Delphine, but women vanish in quick succession. After another accident, an unrecognisably charred corpse is recovered from Delphine's car. Deducing that it is in fact Anna's body, Lavardin has to work out where Delphine is and why she has disappeared. The motive emerges when he learns that it was Delphine's money which the syndicate were relying on for their plans and that she was instead leaving to start a new life with a lover. Freshly arrived in Morasseau's garden is a plaster cast of a nude Delphine, in the base of which Lavardin finds her body. Henriette at last gets Louis into her bed, breaking his mother's hold over him, and Lavardin says he will forget about the sugar in the tank.",

    "Synopsis": "On a crowded New York City street, people have gathered to watch a film crew shoot a sequence where The Actress in a white dress is standing on a grate while the rush of wind caused by a huge fan to imitate the subway going by below blows her skirt up around her waist. The Actress's husband, The Ballplayer, watches with obvious discomfort as she is ogled. The Actress, rather than join him afterwards, disappears in a taxi, leaving him behind. She stops at a store and picks up a variety of toys, flashlights, and balloons. Meanwhile, The Professor is in his hotel room, working on pages of mathematical calculations. He is interrupted by The Senator, who has come to alternately coax and threaten him into appearing before a committee to investigate his activities and answer the famous question, \"Are you now or have you ever been...?\". The Professor refuses and says he will never appear. The Senator leaves, saying he'll be back to get him at 8 a.m. the following morning. The Actress appears at the door of the Professor's hotel room, and he invites her in. They talk about fame, being chased, and the stars. She does a lively demonstration of the theory of relativity using the toys and flashlights and balloons. She tells The Professor he is at the top of her list of people she'd like to sleep with. They decide to go to bed, but are interrupted by the arrival of The Ballplayer, who has tracked her to the hotel. The Professor leaves them alone and goes to find another room, meeting a Cherokee elevator man with whom he speaks. The Actress and The Ballplayer talk about their marriage; The Actress tells her husband she believes she is pregnant, but he has fallen asleep. The following morning The Senator arrives at The Professor's room to find him gone, but The Actress naked and alone in The Professor's bed. He mistakes her for a call girl and threatens to use her to expose and embarrass The Professor, then punches her hard in the abdomen, causing her to collapse in pain. The Professor returns while The Senator is collecting all of the hundreds of pages of The Professor's work to take away with him. The Professor grabs the papers and throws them out of the windows, while The Actress writhes in agony on the bed. The Senator leaves, defeated in his purpose. The Ballplayer returns and talks about his fame in the baseball world, and confides in him about his marital problems while The Actress is in the bathroom, possibly suffering a miscarriage. She finally announces to him that their marriage is over, and he leaves. The Actress becomes impatient with The Professor, sensing that he is hiding something. He is sitting on the bed with his watch, which has stopped at 8:15, in one hand, and the alarm clock in the other as the hour approaches 8:15 (the time that \"Little Boy\" was dropped on Hiroshima). He confesses his terrible feelings of guilt about the event, and she reassures him. Right at 8:15&nbsp;a.m. as she is leaving, he has a vision of the destruction of the room, Hiroshima, and the world. The Actress's skirt swirls in flames as she burns in his vision. Suddenly The Professor's vision stops and reverses itself, and the world is restored to order. The Actress smiles at The Professor, who smiles back as she waves and leaves.",

    "Synopsis": "Joshua Shapiro, successful writer and pundit, in a hospital room, seems to have lost his wife and is in the middle of a sex scandal. Compelled to find meaning in his life, he reviews it from his youth to the present day. Joshua grew up as a Jew in the working class St. Urbain Street area in Montreal. His upbringing was unusual because his father was a boxer who had become a gentle crook and his mother was a strip-tease dancer. Embarrassingly, she strips for his friends as part of a Bar Mitzvah party for him. Joshua's father is revealed to have a unique perspective on life, sex, and religion. A trip to Spain as a young man is the impetus that sparks a career as a journalist and writer. In England in a momentary lapse of reason, Joshua forges letters about a (fake) homosexual affair with a British writer to sell to an American university archive. He meets an upper-class Canadian married to a poseur of a communist and steals her away to become his own wife. She is the daughter of a Canadian senator and Joshua's key into a level of society of which he is contemptuous. In the meantime, Joshua's childhood friends have become successful in their own right. Some become targets for bizarre pranks as he settles various scores. Joshua's conceited brother-in-law assumes a pivotal role in the novel as it is revealed that he is insecure and vulnerable. Neighbors in the wealthy cottage community around Lake Memphremagog lead him astray with dreadful consequences. Past indiscretions rear their ugly heads and Joshua must put together the shambles of his life.",

    "film_title": "Kiss of the Spider Woman (1985 film)",
    "Synopsis": "The film centers on a dialogue between two very different individuals who share a prison cell during the Brazilian military dictatorship: Valentin Arregui, who is imprisoned (and has been tortured) due to his activities on behalf of a leftist revolutionary group, and Luis Molina, a gay man in prison for \"corrupting an underage youth.\" Molina passes the time by recounting memories from one of his favorite films, a wartime romantic thriller that is also a Nazi propaganda film. He weaves the characters into a narrative meant to comfort Valentin and distract him from the harsh realities of political imprisonment and separation from his lover, Marta. Valentin encourages Molina to have self-respect and opens him up to political commitment. Despite Valentin's occasionally snapping at Molina over his shallow views of film-watching and unrealistic romance, an unlikely friendship develops between the two. As the story develops, it becomes clear that Valentin is being poisoned by his jailers to provide Molina with a chance to befriend him, and that Molina is spying on Valentin on behalf of the secret police. Molina has apparently been promised parole if he succeeds in obtaining information that will allow the secret police to break up the revolutionary group. When Molina declares himself in love with Valentin, a physical consummation of that love occurs on Molina's last night in prison. Molina is granted parole in a surprise move by the secret police. Valentin provides Molina with a telephone number and a message for his comrades. Molina at first refuses to take the number, fearing the consequences of treason, but he relents, bidding Valentin farewell with a kiss. Now out of prison, Molina calls the telephone number, and a meeting is arranged with the revolutionary group. But the secret police have had Molina under surveillance, and at the rendezvous, a gun battle occurs, with the revolutionaries shooting Molina. As he wanders the streets wounded, the secret police catch him and demand the telephone number, but Molina refuses and dies. On the orders of the police chief, the policemen dump Molina's body in a rubbish pit and fabricate a story about his death and his presumed collaboration with the revolutionary group. In the prison, Valentin is being treated after being tortured. After a sympathetic doctor risks his job by administering morphine to help him sleep, Valentin appears to succumb to his wounds and perhaps die, when he suddenly finds himself running out of prison with Marta and appearing on an idyllic tropical island with her. Valentin and Marta sail away on a boat into the distance.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1979 Azusa, California, Rocky Dennis, a teenage boy with the extremely rare genetic disorder known as craniodiaphyseal dysplasia, is accepted without question by his freewheeling bohemian biker mother, her boyfriend Gar, who is a father figure to him, his \"extended motorcycle family,\" and his maternal grandparents who share his passion of baseball card collecting; but is treated with fear, pity, awkwardness, and teasing by those unaware of his humanity, humor, and intelligence. Rocky's unstable mother, Florence \"Rusty\" Dennis, is determined to give Rocky as normal a life as possible, in spite of her eccentric and chaotic life as a member of the Turks biker gang, as well as her strained relationship with her father Abe. She fights for Rocky's enrollment in a junior high school, and confronts the principal Mr. Simms who would rather classify Rocky as intellectually disabled and relegate him to a special education school, despite the fact that his condition has not affected his intelligence. At his semi-annual physical, Rocky claims to be feeling well despite recurring excruciating headaches that Rusty can simply remedy by helping to calm him by focusing on happy memories. A young doctor tells Rusty that Rocky's life expectancy is limited to only less than six months, but she scoffs, pointing out that other doctors made erroneous claims about Rocky's condition (e.g. he would be deaf, blind, intellectually impaired, etc.) that were all completely disproven. Rocky goes on to thrive at school, making many friends with his wit and humor, tutoring his classmates for $3 per hour, as well as assisting a fellow student with his locker combination, and telling an entertaining rendition of the Trojan Wars to his history class. Shortly before graduation, he is asked by the principal to accept a job as a counselor's aide at Camp Bloomfield, a summer camp for visually impaired children, which he is hesitant to accept. At his graduation from junior high, Rocky takes home several academic achievement prizes in mathematics, history, and science. Rocky feels the need to help his chronically depressed and drug-addicted mother break her drug habit by leaving drug rehabilitation pamphlets around the house one night at a party. This causes a row to erupt between them and he decides to accept the job offer as a camp counselor. At camp, Rocky falls in love with Diana Adams, an attractive blind teenage girl, who cannot see but feel Rocky's deformed face and is entranced by Rocky's kindness and compassion. Rocky explains to Diana words like \"billowy,\" \"clouds,\" \"red,\" and \"green\" by using cotton balls as a touchable vision of \"billowy clouds,\" a warm rock to explain \"red\" and \"pink,\" and a frozen rock to explain \"icy blue.\" Diana and Rocky also share their first kiss at a New Year's Eve themed dance. At the end of camp, Diana introduces Rocky to her parents, who are horrified at the sight of his abnormal appearance and forbid Diana to spend time with him. Rocky finds it more difficult with attending a high school with none of his old friends from junior high, and continues to encounter increased cruelty from students regarding his deformed face. However, where Rocky used to respond to it with wit and humor, one day he lashes out and slams a bully against a locker after being taunted for having a “mask”. He is further crushed when his lifelong ambitious dream of a motorbike trip through Europe is shattered when his best friend Ben, who was to accompany him, reveals that he is leaving Azusa and moving back to Michigan permanently to live with his father. However, Rocky is able to take a bus trip to visit Diana at the equestrian stables, located near Griffith Park, where Rocky learns that her parents have prevented her from receiving his phone calls and messages and are sending her to a private boarding school for the blind and they will likely never see each other again. Despite this, Rocky vows that despite being separated, they will always love each other and will always be together even in their memories. One evening, when Rocky's biker family is visiting and trying to cheer him up, Rocky is fighting an excruciating headache and withdraws to his room, removes the tacks from his map of Europe, and goes to sleep. The next morning, Rusty gets a call from the school, questioning why Rocky is absent. Rusty finds him in his bedroom and tries to wake him up, but she realizes that Rocky has died in his sleep and flies into a fit of grief-stricken rage, destroying the kitchen. After mourning Rocky's death, Rusty then hugs Rocky's corpse and tearfully tells Rocky, \"Now you can go anywhere you want, baby,\" and re-pins his map. Rocky's biker family, Rusty, Gar, and Dozer, later visit his grave, leaving flowers and some 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers baseball cards by his headstone, while a voice-over by Rocky himself is heard reciting the poem he wrote for English class.",

    "Synopsis": "In the Old West, outside LaHood, California in Carbon Canyon, mining baron Coy LaHood is waging a war of intimidation against independent prospectors and their families — including Hull Barret, who is courting Sarah Wheeler. Sarah's teenage daughter, Megan — desperate for deliverance from LaHood after a gang of his men attack the mining camp and kill her dog – prays for a miracle. Shortly afterward, a man rides a pale horse into Carbon Canyon. When Hull heads to town to pick up supplies, four of Lahood's men harass and assault him, but the stranger intervenes and effortlessly fights them off with an axe handle. Thankful, Hull invites his rescuer to dinner and, while the stranger is washing, notices what appear to be six bullet wounds in his back. When the stranger arrives at the dining table, he is wearing a clerical collar and is thereafter referred to as Preacher. Coy LaHood's son, Joshua, attempts to scare off Preacher with a gigantic workman, Club. Preacher quickly disables Club. When Coy returns from Sacramento, he learns of Preacher's arrival and unsuccessfully attempts to bribe and then threaten him. At Preacher's suggestion, LaHood then offers the prospectors $1,000 per claim provided they evacuate within 24 hours. LaHood says he plans to hire the services of Stockburn, a corrupt marshal, to clear them out if they refuse. The prospectors ultimately reject LaHood's offer, despite Preacher warning them about Stockburn. Megan expresses her love for Preacher, but he gently rebuffs her. Megan angrily assumes Preacher is really in love with Sarah. Preacher visits another town, entering a Wells Fargo bank. He retrieves two pistols from a security box and removes his clerical collar. LaHood's men dam the creek, which forces the miners to prospect a dry bed. Megan rides into LaHood's camp, where Joshua shows her the blasting operation before he attempts to rape her. Preacher arrives on horseback, disarms Joshua and shoots him through the hand. Stockburn and his deputies arrive in LaHood. Coy gives him a rough description of Preacher, which startles Stockburn, because the man Coy is describing is dead. Spider Conway, one of the prospectors and Coy's former partner, discovers a large gold nugget in the dry creek bed. He rides into town with his teenage sons, where he yells drunken abuse at LaHood from the street. Stockburn and his deputies gun Conway down, with Stockburn himself shooting Conway in the head. Stockburn sends a message that he wants Preacher to meet him in town the next morning. Sarah begs Preacher not to go, and tells him she will marry Hull, despite her feelings for Preacher. The following day, Preacher and Hull blow up LaHood's mining site with dynamite. To stop Hull from following him, Preacher scares off Hull's horse and rides into town alone. In the gunfight that follows, he kills all of LaHood's men when they attack him, except for two who run away. Then, one by one, Preacher kills all six of Stockburn's deputies. In the final shootout, Stockburn recognizes Preacher in disbelief before Stockburn is shot in the chest six times, leaving six exit wounds in his back similar to the wounds on Preacher's back. Preacher kills him with a shot to the head. LaHood, watching from his office, aims a rifle at the Preacher, but Hull, who walked all the way into town, shoots LaHood dead. Preacher nods at Hull and rides off toward the snow-capped mountains. Megan arrives and, seeing Preacher riding away, shouts her love and gratitude to him.",

    "Synopsis": "Nina is a young headstrong woman who has traveled to Paris from her provincial home in Toulouse searching immediate success as an actress. Tired of one-night stands and sharing quarters with others, she sets out to find her own apartment, stopping in to a realtor's office. There, she meets Paulot, a timid real estate clerk, who is immediately smitten by her. She invites him to see her perform in the small role she has as a maid in a boulevard comedy. After the play, Nina takes Paulot for dinner with her current boyfriend Fred, but the couple has a major row, breaking off their relationship. Paulot invites Nina to stay at his apartment while she finds her own place, but his roommate, Quentin, refuses to let her stay. They have to settle for a hotel room for the night. In their long walk through the city, she tells Paulot that she has slept with nearly every man she has encountered. She complains to him that she is tired of being used solely for easy sex and asks him to leave her alone. Quentin, however, has followed them to the hotel: he forces his attentions on Nina. Nina and Quentin then begin an intense and violent liaison. An actor who performs in a live sex show version of Romeo and Juliet, Quentin is unpredictable and provocative. Nina bounces between the two vastly different men: the gentle Paulot and the dangerous and intense Quentin. Nina has an approach/avoidance conflict with Quentin, all the while fending off offers by Paulot to take care of her. When he finds that she has slept with Quentin, Paulot starts to change his calm manners towards Nina, but he does not lose his craving for her. Quentin is run over and killed by a car, in what seems to be a suicide. The only other person attending his funeral is the elderly theater director, Scrutzler, who eventually explains that in London he had cast Quentin as Romeo, but Quentin had withdrawn after he survived a suicide pact with Scrutzler's daughter, with whom he had a passionate love affair. During casting of Romeo and Juliet, Scrutzler recognizes Nina among the aspiring actresses for the role and cast her as Juliet. Full of self-doubt and fear, stimulated by the ghost-like appearances of the dead Quentin, Nina prepares for the role and copes with Paulot's advances. They share an apartment, but have settled for a platonic relationship. However, Paulot is still in love with Nina and is jealous of Scrutzler's interest on her. Paulot confronts Scrutzler, but in spite of the director's assurance that his interest in her is only of a paternal nature, Paulot leaves Nina. Nina struggles to rehearse her role as Juliet in the forthcoming play but, after Paulot leaves her, realizes that he is the one she is really in love with. Nina goes to his work looking for him and entices him to make love to her. They have sex for the first time, in a violent and degrading coupling. Nina then insists in going for a long nocturnal walk, like the one they had the first time they met. She gives him a ticket for the coming opening night of Romeo and Juliet, but after he leaves her, Paulot tears up the ticket, reaffirming his decision to break away from her. Nina, nervously preparing for her entrance, suffers stage fright. Scrutzler calms her down, but then leaves for London, deciding she must continue on her own. As the film ends, Nina is left alone in the stage wings. The play is about to start...",

    "Synopsis": "The film is set in Argentina in 1983, in the final year of the country's last military dictatorship, during which a campaign of state-sponsored terrorism produced thousands of killings and torture of accused political leftists and innocents alike, who were buried in unmarked graves or became desaparecidos. Alicia Maquet, a high school history teacher, and her husband, Roberto Ibañez, a government official, live in Buenos Aires with their 5-year-old adopted daughter, Gaby. Alicia, like other members of the Argentine upper-middle class, is not aware of how much killing and suffering has gone on in the country, and naively believes only guilty people are arrested. Alicia's views are challenged by a fellow teacher, Benítez (Patricio Contreras), and some of her students. During a discussion about the death of Argentinean founding father Mariano Moreno, one student, Costa, argues that the government-issued history textbooks are \"written by murderers.\" Ana, Alicia's longtime friend, returns from exile in Europe and explains why she never told Alicia she was leaving. At first Ana laughs as she tells of her apartment being ransacked by officials, but soon begins to sob as she describes being held captive and tortured for having lived with Pedro, who was labeled as subversive, even though she hadn't seen him in two years. She says that while she was held captive, she witnessed pregnant women leave to give birth but return without their babies, whom she believes were sold to rich couples. Alicia increasingly wonders about Gaby's origins and asks questions about Gaby's birth, a topic her husband has told her to ignore. Alicia asks why they celebrate the day they brought her home rather than the day she was born, and whether or not Roberto actually met Gaby's mother. Roberto insists it was a normal adoption. Costa continues to provoke his classmates, and one day Alicia arrives to see newspaper accounts of the desaparecidos taped to the blackboard. When Alicia reports the student, Benítez intervenes to protect him. Alicia gradually becomes friendly with Benítez as her research brings her closer to the truth. While seeking Gaby's hospital birth records, Alicia learns of an organization searching for missing children. She meets Sara, whose pregnant daughter was kidnapped by the armed forces, and believes Gaby may be her granddaughter. Sara has a photo of her daughter at Gaby's age, looking identical to Gaby. Roberto faces stress at work due to the machinations of his colleagues, several of whom disappear over the course of the film. Ana confronts him and accuses him of denouncing her and causing her arrest. He also comes into friction with his liberal father and brother, who frown on his ties to the ruling conservative military elite and argue in favor of social justice. Alicia brings Sara home to meet Roberto, but he is infuriated and demands that Sara leave. After Alicia realizes he does not care about knowing the truth about Gaby's parents, she informs Roberto that Gaby is not at home and asks him how he feels not knowing where his child is, which prompts him to assault her in a fit of rage. The violence is interrupted by a telephone call from Gaby, who is at her grandparents’ house. She asks Roberto to let her sing \"En el país de Nomeacuerdo\" (In the Country of Idonotremember), a nursery rhyme, to her mother and, after she hangs up, Alicia tearfully grabs her purse and walks out the door, leaving her keys behind. The final scene shows Gaby sitting in a wicker rocking chair, continuing to sing.",

    "Synopsis": "In June 1950, a local neighbourhood drunk, Čika Franjo, serenades field workers. He sings Mexican songs out of self-preservation, figuring it's safer for him to steer clear of songs originating from either of the two dominant global superpowers—the United States and the Soviet Union—in the prevailing climate of the Cold War. Yugoslavia is experiencing a paranoid and repressive internal apparatus looking to identify and remove enemies of the state in the wake of the Tito–Stalin Split. The local children, including Malik, climb trees and play around. Malik's mother, Sena, tells him that his father is on a business trip, while Malik is a chronic sleepwalker. His father, communist functionary Meša, was, in fact, sent to a labour camp by his own brother-in-law, Sena's brother Zijo, who is an even higher-positioned Communist functionary. Meša had made a remark about a political cartoon regarding the Tito–Stalin Split in the Politika newspaper. Malik gets circumcised by his father's brother. (Apparently these people are Muslims, because if they were Jewish he would have been circumcised as a newborn.) After a while, Meša's wife and children rejoin him in Zvornik. Malik meets and falls in love with Maša, the daughter of a Russian doctor, but last sees her when an ambulance takes her away. At the wedding of his maternal uncle Fahro, Malik witnesses his father's affair with a woman pilot. She later tries to commit suicide by using a toilet's flush cord. Sena reconciles with her brother Zijah, who has been diagnosed with diabetes.",

    "Synopsis": "Late one evening, mild-mannered New York computer clerk Paul Hackett strikes up a conversation with Marcy Franklin at a café. Paul is intrigued by the quirky stranger – whose roommate, sculptor Kiki Bridges, makes and sells plaster-of-Paris paperweights resembling bagels – and accepts her phone number. Later, Paul takes a taxi to her SoHo apartment, but his only $20 bill flies out the taxi window, leaving him virtually penniless and earning the driver's wrath. At the apartment, Kiki is working on a large sculpture of a screaming man while Marcy is out. When Marcy returns, her erratic behavior and Paul's discovery of burn cream and ominous photos convince him that she is severely disfigured and unstable. Unnerved, he abandons the date. Attempting to take the subway home, he learns the fare has jumped at midnight, and he cannot afford to pay. Paul goes to a bar tended by Tom, who lends Paul his apartment key to retrieve the key for the bar's cash register, but Paul floods the bathroom and is nearly lynched by suspicious residents. On the street, Paul confronts two thieves hauling away Kiki's sculpture and chases them off. Returning the sculpture to the apartment, he discovers that Marcy has committed suicide by overdosing on Seconal. Her body shows no burns, disproving Paul's misconceptions about her. On the way out, Paul grabs a note from Kiki inviting him and Marcy to Club Berlin. On his way there, Paul runs into the bar's waitress Julie, who brings him up to her apartment and flirts aggressively. After Paul scorns her, she brands him the neighborhood burglar via handmade wanted posters. Paul is denied entry into Club Berlin for lacking a mohawk, and punks chase him with clippers. After retrieving his $20 bill from Kiki's sculpture, he encounters the original taxi driver, who robs him. Paul meets a Mister Softee ice cream truck driver named Gaill, who initially offers aid but later joins the mob hunting him after seeing Julie's posters. Paul approaches a man for help, but his plea is mistaken for a sexual proposition. He then calls the police, but is ignored. Paul ducks into the now-empty Club Berlin. Exhausted, bedraggled, and ranting, Paul drops his last coin into the jukebox for Peggy Lee's \"Is That All There Is?\", and dances with June, an older sculptress living beneath the club. June hides him from the mob by covering him in papier-mâché, disguising him as a sculpture resembling Kiki's screaming man, but the plaster hardens. The two thieves break in, mistake the rigid Paul for the sculpture they dropped earlier, and haul him away in their van. During a sharp turn uptown, the rear doors swing open; Paul tumbles out, smashing onto the pavement directly in front of his Midtown office building just before dawn. The impact shatters the plaster. Dazed, he staggers inside, sits at his desk, and stares at his computer terminal as it boots up to greet him for another day of work.",

    "Synopsis": "May is hiding out at a rundown motel in the Mojave Desert when an old flame and childhood friend, Eddie, a rodeo stunt rider, shows up unexpectedly from Wyoming. Eddie breaks into May's room and attempts to convince her in argumentative terms that their fates are somehow linked and that they should be together. May vehemently refuses him for a variety of reasons, one being his infidelity with a fashion model known only as the Countess. May says that she has no interest in living with Eddie under any circumstances, assuring Eddie that if she goes back to him their relationship will repeat the same destructive cycle it has followed before. May informs Eddie that her current boyfriend, Martin, is due to arrive that night for a date. As May and Eddie squabble and goad each other, the motel proprietor, known as the Old Man, observes them. The Old Man offers commentary and anecdotes to May and Eddie, divulging his relationship with both. It is slowly revealed that May and Eddie are in fact biological half-siblings, each fathered by the Old Man who had led a double life, abandoning their respective families in the same town for different periods during each child's life. Without knowledge of their father's philandering, May and Eddie became lovers in high school and when their parents finally figured out what had occurred, Eddie's mother shot herself out of guilt and shame. May has grown to fear that Eddie has begun to emulate his father's feckless womanizing. Eddie performs rodeo tricks with a lasso in the motel restaurant, while May looks on, drinking whiskey. The Countess arrives at the motel in a black Mercedes and opens fire at the restaurant with a revolver, apparently trying to shoot Eddie for his misconduct and mistreatment of her in their affair, before speeding away. As Eddie picks up a raging May and carries her back to her room, the Old Man remarks that he does not recognize himself in either of them. Martin arrives in the midst of the fight and tackles Eddie. May calms the situation, claiming that Eddie is her cousin, and that the two were in the midst of a trivial argument. In the restaurant, Martin listens to each individual's recounting of events in bewilderment: Eddie confesses to Martin that May is his sister, and that the two fell in love before realizing they were related. May, however, claims they are not siblings, and that this is a fantasy Eddie has created. Meanwhile, the Old Man challenges May's story about Eddie's mother's suicide, claiming he was unaware of her death. The Old Man urges Eddie to come to his defense, but Eddie admits that his mother in fact killed herself with the Old Man's shotgun in a fit of despair. The Old Man accuses Eddie of betraying him as Eddie and May embrace. The Countess returns to the motel and again opens fire. A stray bullet from her revolver sets off an explosion which ignites the entire motel into a blaze of fire. Eddie flees on horseback after the Countess as she drives away, while May departs on foot in the opposite direction with her suitcase in hand, leaving Martin behind. The Old Man closes himself inside his ramshackle trailer as the entire property is consumed by flames.",

Mortwell also wants George to gather information on one of Simone's wealthy customers for blackmail purposes. Simone, who has worked hard to develop high-class manners and an elite clientele, initially dislikes the uncouth and outspoken George, and he regards her as putting on airs. But as George and Simone find out more about each other, they form a friendship, and George begins to fall in love with her. George agrees, at the risk of his own life, to help Simone find her teenage friend Cathy, who has disappeared, and who Simone fears is being abused by her violent former pimp, Anderson.

After two previous escape attempts, Manny is put in solitary confinement for three years. A court order compels Associate Warden Ranken to release him from solitary. Planning a third breakout, Manny is forced to advance his plan to mid-winter after he is stabbed in the hand. Manny recruits young prisoner Buck McGeehy to help in the plan. After escaping from the prison via a sewer tunnel that opens near a freezing river, and a cross-country hike, the two arrive at a switchyard. After stealing railroad clothing, they board a train, consisting only of four locomotives. The elderly railroad engineer, Al, has a fatal heart attack after starting the train and falls off the lead locomotive. He applies the brakes, but the locomotives overpower them, resulting in the brake shoes burning off. As the unmanned train accelerates, dispatchers Dave Prince and Frank Barstow are alerted to the situation. Barstow allows the train to reach the mainline while trying to keep the tracks farther down the line clear. The runaway smashes the rear flatbed and caboose of another train pulling onto a siding. The collision damages the cab of the lead locomotive and jams the front door of the second engine, an older EMD F-unit, or \"'A' Unit\". Barstow's superior Eddie McDonald orders him to derail the train. The train's horn then blows, alerting the authorities (and the two fugitives) that someone else is aboard the train. Barstow has the maintainer cancel the derailment. Ranken concludes his two escaped convicts are fleeing by rail. Meanwhile, the fugitives are discovered by Sara, a locomotive hostler who explains she sounded the horn and the train is out of control. As jumping off the train at its current speed would be suicide, the only possible way to stop it would be to climb forward onto the lead engine and press its kill switch, a difficult feat due to the 'A' Unit's jammed front door and its obsolete rounded streamlined designs having no outside catwalk, unlike the first, third, and fourth locomotives. They shut down the third and fourth locomotives by disconnecting the multi-unit cables. Further ahead the train's present route is a tight curve near a chemical plant. Realizing the train would derail at the curve causing a major environmental disaster, the dispatchers divert the runaway onto a dead-end branch line, thus condemning all three on board to death, rather than risking a chemical explosion. Manny tries forcing Buck into a suicidal scramble around the second engine's frozen nose. Sara's intervention on Buck's behalf results in an armed face-off between the convicts. Emotionally broken, all three slump into depression. Ranken arrives in a helicopter and his accomplice is lowered towards the lead engine, but falls through the second engine's windscreen, and then under the train. Spurred on by the appearance of his archenemy with a resolve to not be returned to prison, Manny makes a perilous leap to the lead engine. He falls off the train but grabs onto the coupling to prevent himself from slipping off it. While attempting to reboard, the knuckle shifts, crushing his injured hand. Ranken boards the locomotive from the helicopter; Manny handcuffs him inside the lead engine after brutally beating him. Realizing what Manny intends to do, the frightened Ranken furiously demands Manny to stop the train before it crashes; but Manny has chosen to die (and take Ranken to his death with him) rather than be recaptured. When reminded of Buck and Sara in the second engine, Manny uncouples the lead engine from the rest of the train, which makes the latter shut down and come to a stop. He waves goodbye (ignoring Buck's screaming pleas to shut down the lead engine) and climbs onto the roof in the freezing snow, with his arms stretched out, embracing his impending death. Buck and Manny's fellow inmates mourn in their cells as the lone engine vanishes into the storm, towards its inevitable fate. The film ends with a quote from Shakespeare's Richard III: \"No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity. But I know none, and therefore am no beast\".",

    "Synopsis": "Thomas, a troubled thirteen-year-old boy, picking flowers in a cemetery, is surprised by Martin, an escaped convict who demands that the boy bring him some money for train fare later that day. The boy does not know where to get money; the criminal tells him to ask his parents. \"My parents are dead,\" the boy says. In fact, his parents, Maurice and Lili, are alive. They are separated but they both live near the boy's grandparents' house. Thomas, disaffected by his parents divorce, goes to a boarding catholic school but is spending the weekend with his family and he is going to have first communion. His grandmother is arranging to celebrate that special day and hopes her daughter and son in law would reconcile. The boy tries to get the money for the convict stealing from Lili, his mother, but then sees her sad and, in a moment of love, gives it back to her, admitting what he's done. He goes through a series of increasingly desperate attempts to get money and eventually scrounges some out of his grumpy grandfather, who just wants to go fishing. When the boy returns to give Martin the money, the convict's accomplice, Luc, decides that the boy is too much of a liability and tries to kill him. Martin saves Thomas's life killing his accomplice. Lili Ravenel, who is emotionally close and distant to her son, is worried about Thomas. He is not doing well at school, according to the school's chaplain who comes to complain about the boy's behavior. Lili, trapped in a humdrum existence, runs a nightclub that is situated on a river just at the water's edge. Pushed by her mother, she had married Maurice against her better judgment and now needs to escape the stifling effects of her union with him, but he continues to want her. Maurice threatens to remove the care and custody of her son from her. Lili has to perform her marital duties even after the divorce - while Maurice screens old home-movies of their domestic happiness long past and gone. After killing Luc, Martin arrives to have a drink at a bar by a river. That is where Lili works. He has no money and at the end of the night, fascinated by the young man, she arranges for the fugitive to take a room at a local hotel. When she arrives home, her son tells her the story in the cemetery, as it was a dream he had, but she realizes that it actually happened and the convict is the man she just left in the hotel. The celebration in honor of the Holy Communion goes on with little family harmony after Thomas wishes that an atomic bomb would destroy his school. The grandmother tries to keep the family together. Alice, the convicts' shared girlfriend comes, gun in hand, to help them escape to Tangier. They have been inseparable for years. Martin tells her that he was forced to kill Luc. Lili's suspicions are confirmed when she witnesses the efforts of Martin and Alice to hide the corpse in a graveyard. Martin lets her go and leaves the town with Alice. He changed his mind shortly after and returns to the village alone and goes to the bar in search of Lili. They are smitten by each other and by night, she takes the bold decision to run away with him without a hint of regret or lingering doubt. Before escaping with the convict, Lili tells her mother what she plans to do, but does not change her mind in spite of her mother's protests. The boy's teacher and confessor confronts him with the published news of the two escapees and pressures him to tell the truth to the authorities. That same stormy night, Thomas escapes from the boarding school to see his mother, but when he arrives to her house, he discovers Lili and Martin making love. Thomas runs and when Martin goes after him, Alice who has also come, shoots Martin. Shortly after, Alice kills herself smashing her sport car against a wall. The next morning Lili goes to see Thomas who is staying with his father, but Maurice only allows her to see him without revealing that she is there. Later, at the police station, Lili tells the truth and incriminates herself. She leaves the village detained in a police van. At the same time, Thomas is seen riding his bike.",

Trilby encourages her mother (Justine Saunders) to apply for a Housing Commission home being built in an area inhabited mostly by wealthier white families. Her mother, sister Noonah, and Trilby save enough for them all (father and younger brother as well) to move there from the \"fringe\". They buy some new furniture for the house and improve their station in life. But there is a culture clash. Trilby learns that her family is actually happier surrounded by their community and extended family, and that her own goals are not necessarily the goals of others in her life. With xenophobic neighbors casting a constant judgmental eye, Trilby and her boyfriend, Phil (Ernie Dingo), attempt to find happiness in their new environment. Trilby becomes pregnant, gives birth, but drowns her baby, making it look like an accident. Her family leave their suburban house after Trilby's father loses all their rent money in a card game: the family return to their house in the camp.

    "Synopsis": "In the 1750s, Jesuit priest Father Gabriel enters the eastern Paraguayan jungle to convert the Guaraní to Christianity. He sends another priest to make contact with them, but the man is thrown to his death from Iguazu Falls. Father Gabriel travels to the falls and plays his oboe. One of the Guaraní grabs the oboe from his hands and breaks it in half. Father Gabriel does not react, and the remaining Guaraní, captivated by the music, take him to their village. Captain Rodrigo Mendoza is a mercenary and slave trader, and a guest of the Spanish governor, Don Cabeza. His fiancée Carlotta confesses that she is in love with his brother Felipe. After Mendoza catches them sleeping together, he kills Felipe in a duel — an act that leaves him riddled with guilt. Father Gabriel, a friend of the governor's, challenges Mendoza to undergo penance. Mendoza is forced to accompany the Jesuits to their mission while dragging his heavy armor and sword behind him. The natives recognise their persecutor, but soon forgive a tearful Mendoza. Father Gabriel's mission is depicted as a place of sanctuary and education for the Guaraní. Moved by the Guaraní's acceptance, Mendoza wishes to help, and Father Gabriel gives him a Bible. In time, Mendoza takes vows and becomes a Jesuit. With the protection offered under Spanish law, the Jesuit missions have been safe. The newly signed Treaty of Madrid reapportions land on which the missions are located, transferring it to the Portuguese. The Portuguese have no interest in converting the natives, viewing them as animals fit only for slavery. Aware that the Jesuits would likely oppose such efforts, Papal emissary Cardinal Altamirano, a Jesuit, is sent to survey the missions and decide which, if any, should be allowed to remain. Under pressure from both Cabeza and the Portuguese emissary Hontar, Altamirano is forced to choose between two evils. If he rules in favour of the colonists, the indigenous peoples will become enslaved; if in favour of the missions, the Jesuit Order may be condemned by the Portuguese, and the Catholic Church could fracture. Altamirano visits the missions and is amazed at their success in converting the native peoples. At Father Gabriel's mission, he tries to explain the reasons behind closing the missions and instructs the Guaraní that they must leave because \"it is God's will\". The Guaraní question this and argue that God's will is to develop the mission. Father Gabriel and Mendoza, under threat of excommunication, state their intention to defend the mission even at the cost of their lives. They are, however, divided on how to do it. Father Gabriel believes that violence is a direct crime against God. Mendoza, by contrast, decides to break his vows by militarily defending the mission. Against Father Gabriel's wishes, he teaches the Guaraní the European art of war. When a joint Portuguese and Spanish force attacks, Mendoza and a Guaraní militia resist them. Their heroic defense is quickly overcome by the superior weaponry and numbers of the enemy. After breaking through and mortally wounding Mendoza soldiers encounter the Jesuits of the mission leading the Guaraní women and children singing in a religious procession. Father Gabriel is at the head, carrying a monstrance with the Blessed Sacrament. The colonial forces organize a firing line and discharge their guns directly into the procession, killing the priests. After Mendoza sees Father Gabriel die before succumbing to his own wounds, a Guaraní man picks up the Blessed Sacrament and continues to lead the procession. Most of the natives are subsequently captured to be sold as slaves, but a small group of children manages to escape into the jungle. In a final exchange between Altamirano and Hontar, the latter notes that what has happened was unfortunate but inevitable: \"We must work in the world; the world is thus.\" Altamirano rejoins: \"No, thus have we made the world. Thus have I made it.\" Days later, a canoe carrying the surviving children returns to the pillaged and burned mission, retrieving their belongings and departing up the river.",

    "Synopsis": "Alexander is an actor who gave up the stage to work as a journalist, critic and lecturer on aesthetics. He lives in a beautiful house with his actress wife Adelaide, stepdaughter Marta, and young son, \"Little Man\", who is temporarily mute due to a throat operation. Alexander and Little Man plant a tree by the seaside, when Alexander's friend Otto, a part-time postman, delivers a birthday card to him. When Otto asks, Alexander says his relationship with God is \"nonexistent\". After Otto leaves, Adelaide and Victor, a medical doctor and a close family friend who performed Little Man's operation, arrive and offer to take Alexander and Little Man home in Victor's car, but Alexander prefers to stay behind and talk to his son. In his monologue, he first recounts how he and Adelaide found their house near the sea by accident, and how they fell in love with it and its surroundings, but then enters a bitter tirade against the state of modern man. Little Man hides from Alexander and jumps on his back as a surprise, but Alexander accidentally bats him away, giving Little Man a nosebleed. As Tarkovsky wrote, Alexander is weary of \"the pressures of change, the discord in his family, and his instinctive sense of the threat posed by the relentless march of technology\"; in fact, he has \"grown to hate the emptiness of human speech\". The family, Victor, and Otto gather at Alexander's house for the celebration. Their maid Maria leaves, while nurse-maid Julia stays to help with the dinner. People comment on Maria's odd behavior. The guests chat inside the house, where Otto reveals that he is a student of paranormal phenomena, a collector of \"inexplicable but true incidents.\" Just when dinner is almost ready, the rumbling noise of low-flying jet fighters interrupts them, and soon after, as Alexander enters, a news program announces the beginning of what appears to be World War III, and possibly nuclear holocaust. His wife has a complete nervous breakdown and is comforted and sedated by Victor. In despair, Alexander vows to God to renounce all he loves, even Little Man, if this may be undone. Otto advises him to slip away and lie with Maria, who Otto tells him is a witch \"in the best possible sense\". Alexander takes a pistol from Victor's medical bag, leaves a note in his room, escapes the house, and rides Otto's bike to Maria's house. He tells her the story of when he fixed up and brought order to his mother's garden, only to find that it lost all its beauty when he did so. She is bewildered when he makes his advances, but when he puts the gun to his temple (\"Don't kill us, Maria\"), at which point the jet fighters' rumblings return, she soothes him and they make love while floating above her bed, though Alexander's reaction is ambiguous. When he wakes the next morning, in his own bed, everything seems normal. Nevertheless, Alexander sets forth to give up all he loves and possesses. He tricks the family members and friends into going for a walk, and sets fire to their house while they are away. As the group rushes back, alarmed by the fire, Alexander confesses that he set it, and runs around wildly. Maria, who until then was not seen that morning, appears; Alexander tries to approach her, but is restrained by others. Without explanation, an ambulance appears, and two paramedics chase Alexander, who appears to have lost control of himself, and drive off with him. Maria begins to bicycle away, but stops to observe Little Man watering the tree he and Alexander planted the day before. As Maria leaves, the \"mute\" Little Man, lying at the foot of the tree, speaks his only line, which quotes the opening of the Gospel of John: \"In the beginning was the Word. Why is that, Papa?\"",

She lives in France with her French mother Julia and English father Harry. By chance, during an excursion to Rome with her journalist father, she is offered a small part in an American film set in the 1950s about Cesare Pavese as Gabriella, Pavese's love interest. The lead role is played by Steve Elliot, a charming American who is passionate about the writer he is playing, although his work is unknown in the United States. He is married to Susan, who is at home in New York City but falls in love with his co-star Jane on the set. After meeting Steve, Jane abandons her relationship with her French lover and friend Bruno. After Jane's part in the movie is finished, she moves into Steve's rented villa on the outskirts of Rome while he continues to work on the film at the studio. The two of them soon become lovers and embark on a torrid affair, which is almost discovered when Susan shows up one day in Rome to see Steve on a surprise visit with their children; however, Steve's best friend Michael Pozner manages to sneak Jane out of the house before she is discovered. Complications for Jane continue when Bruno tracks her down to Rome and eventually discovers the affair. In a jealous rage, he leaks the affair to the press just as Steve completes his work on the film. To makes things worse, Jane learns that her mother has terminal cancer and will die soon unless she returns to France quickly.

Wanda is initially annoyed with Henry, saying that she \"hates people,\" but ends up being intrigued by him. The two buy liquor at a nearby store, and Wanda steals corn from a cornfield, attracting the attention of the police. The two run to her apartment, evading them. Wanda boils the corn but discovers it is green and inedible and freaks out, saying that nothing in her life ever works out. Henry comforts her. However, things become acrimonious between Henry and Wanda when Henry discovers that Wanda has slept with Eddie. After he chastises her for it, Wanda beats Henry with her purse, knocking him unconscious. Later, a detective following Henry sees him covered in blood and calls 911. Two paramedics arrive and are unfazed by Henry's being covered in blood, telling him not to waste their time. Wanda returns later, and the two apologize to one another. That night, Wanda claims to be dying in bed, seeing angels. Henry calls 911 and the same paramedics arrive, much to his surprise, and claim Wanda is just drunk and \"too fat.\" After Wanda leaves to look for a job the next morning, Henry is tracked down by Tully Sorenson, a wealthy book publisher who has been impressed with his writing and is interested in publishing some of his work. She finds him through the detective she has hired. Knowing Henry is destitute, Tully pays him an \"advance\" of $500. Henry then breaks into another apartment after hearing a man abusing his wife. After the man threatens to cut his wife's throat, he and Henry get into an altercation which results in the man being stabbed. Henry scrambles out of the apartment building and goes for a drive in L.A. with Tully. At one point, he rams a car where a man and woman are making out while the light is green. Tully says he was immature and reckless in his response. She then takes him back to her home where, after drinks, the two have sex. At first, Henry is impressed with the promise of wealth and security, including an endless supply of booze that working for Tully could provide. However, he begins to realize that he is uncomfortable being involved with Tully, romantically or professionally, because of class differences, saying that she is \"trapped in a cage with golden bars\". Henry determines he must leave. He and Wanda go to the Golden Horn, where Henry requests a round on him for the entire bar. To Eddie's surprise, Henry pays with some of the advance he received from Tully and sarcastically leaves a tip for Eddie, saying \"Buy a drink on me.\" Tully heads out to see if she can change his mind and finds him at the bar where a drunken, jealous Wanda proceeds to beat her up. When Henry does not intercede, Tully realizes that Henry does not care about her and does not want her help. So she leaves the bar and gives up on publishing his work. Eddie calls Henry out, and they go out behind the bar for another fight. Henry and the other barflies follow Eddie out the door, the fight starts, and the crowd cheers the two men.",

    "Synopsis": "Six months before Santiago Nasar was killed, a handsome, young foreigner arrived to his hometown, a small Colombian city in the banks of the Magdalena river. His name is Bayardo San Román. Little is known about him except that he is very rich and in want of a wife. Bayardo is soon smitten by the extraordinary beauty of a local girl, Angela Vicario. She is uninterested in his advances, but Bayardo does whatever it takes to win her approval by showering her with gifts. The next time Bayardo sees her, she is selling tickets for a raffle at a town event. He buys all of the remaining tickets and wins a music box, which he then has delivered to her house as a gift. Bayardo asks Angela what house she likes best, and she replies that she likes the one that belongs to the widower Xius. The widower insists that the house is not for sale, but Bayardo keeps offering more and more money until Xius gives in. When Angela protests to her parents that she does not love Bayardo, her mother dismissed her argument, telling her that love can be learned. Pressured by her family, she yields and the couple gets married with a lavish party. On the wedding night, Bayardo discovers that Angela is not a virgin and returns her to her bewildered family. Angela is beaten by her mother until she is forced to confess who took her virginity: Santiago Nasar. Angela's brothers (who are twins) are forced by local custom to avenge the family's honor, by taking Santiago's life. The murder takes place the day after the wedding when the town is in turmoil waiting for the visit of the bishop who is crossing the city by the river. The twins Pablo and Pedro Vicario, are reluctant to commit the crime, but they must kill the man who took their sister's honor. The twins, with knives wrapped in newspaper, wait for Santiago to appear in Clotilde Armenta's shop, who gives them rum, hoping to make them so drunk that they will be unable to commit the killing. Eventually, many people learn of the murder plan, but nobody does anything to stop the brothers or warn Santiago. People in the town are divided into three sides. Those who think that the brothers are kidding, people who know what is going to happen and think that the tragedy must be stopped, and local authorities who fail to exercise their duties and prevent the murder from occurring. It seems that people choose to keep Santiago in the dark and allow the tragedy to happen. Flora, Santiago's girlfriend, is upset and humiliated when she learns the accusation and about the death threats. When Santiago comes to see her, still clueless as to the Vicario's intentions, she is furious. She tells him that she hopes they kill him, and she goes into her room and locks the door. Flora's father tells him that the Vicarios want to kill him. Santiago leaves the house and starts to head home. When Santiago appears by the plaza, he is prevented by Clotilde who yells at him to run for his life. Santiago is unarmed, so he tries to find refuge in his house. However, his mother locks the door because she thinks that he is inside. The Vicario twins stab him and kill him in the main square. There is no evidence that Santiago had taken Angela's virginity. They were never seen together. It is widely believed in town that Angela was protecting the real culprit. However, during the investigation after the murder, and even when she is questioned again 27 years later by Cristóbal, she never changes her story, she still claims that Santiago Nasar was her \"perpetrator\". Angela, who up until her marriage was not in love with Bayardo, falls hopelessly in love with him after the tragic wedding night. From then on and for many years, she writes love letters to him weekly, but she never hears from him. Then, halfway through a day, Bayardo comes back to her unexpectedly. He leaves a trail with the unopened letters she has sent him, Angela follows them and they are reunited.",

    "Synopsis": "Romano is sitting at a table in the empty restaurant aboard an Italian ship, having a drink. When Pavel, a middle-aged Russian on his honeymoon cruise, enters the room, the two men strike up a conversation. Romano mentions that he once travelled to Russia because of a woman, and an intrigued Pavel asks to hear his story. Born from a poor family, Romano graduated as an architect but he never had a chance to practice his profession following his marriage to a very wealthy woman called Elisa, who is busy running a bank she has just inherited. With little to do, Romano takes a solitary holiday at an expensive spa. There he meets Anna, a Russian woman vacationing on her own, who tells him about her poor background and her marriage to a rich man for security. After one night together, Anna leaves Romano a farewell letter and travels back to Russia. Having decided that he wants to spend his life with her, Romano, on pretence of exploring business opportunities, travells to Russia to Anna's remote town. While Anna's husband is busy hosting a reception for a distinguished foreign guest, Romano follows Anna around and manages to secretly meet with her in an henhouse. Romano promises that if she will wait for him, he will travel to Italy and separate from his wife. Once back to Italy, he discovers that his Elisa's bank had collapsed and bailiffs have put her palatial house up for sale. Elisa welcomes Romano holding the letter he has received from Anna, and asks him if he has a lover in Russia. Romano denies it, and the two somehow reconcile. Later Elisa unexpectedly inherits a legacy and as such the couple is able to resume their opulent lifestyle. After hearing Romano's story, Pavel mentions that his wife too has left a very unhappy marriage and how it took him a long time to persuade her to remarry. The conversation is abruptly interrupted by the ship's cook, who comes in and tells Romano to start laying the tables for lunch. Pavel, having realized that Romano is employed on the ship, excuses himself and goes to look for his wife, who turns out to be Anna.",

    "Synopsis": "Islington, 9 August 1967. Literary agent Peggy Ramsay knocks on the door of playwright Joe Orton and his lover Kenneth Halliwell, but nobody opens. She calls the police. They find the corpses of the two men. A decade later theatre critic John Lahr visits Peggy Ramsay because he wants to write Orton's biography. They find Orton's diaries, and Peggy tells Lahr about Orton's life. Orton and Halliwell's relationship began at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. Orton started out as the uneducated youth to Halliwell's older faux-sophisticate. As the relationship progressed, however, Orton grew increasingly confident in his talent while Halliwell's writing stagnated. They fell into a parody of a traditional married couple, with Orton as the \"husband\" and Halliwell as the long-suffering and increasingly-ignored \"wife\" (a situation exacerbated at a time when being a sexually active homosexual was illegal). Orton was commissioned to write a screenplay for the Beatles. Halliwell got carried away in preparing for a meeting with the \"Fab Four\", but Orton was taken away for a meeting on his own. Finally, in August 1967, a despondent Halliwell kills Orton and commits suicide.",

    "Synopsis": "Repentance is set in a small Georgian town. The film starts with the scene of a woman preparing cakes. A man in a chair is reading from a newspaper that the town's mayor, Varlam Aravidze (Avtandil Makharadze) has died. One day after the funeral the corpse of the mayor turns up in the garden of his son's house. The corpse is reburied, only to reappear again in the garden. A woman, Ketevan Barateli ( ), is eventually arrested and accused of digging up the corpse. She defends herself and states that Varlam does not deserve to be buried as he was responsible for a Stalin-like regime of terror responsible for the disappearance of her parents and her friends. She is put on trial and gives her testimony, with the story of Varlam's regime being told in flashbacks. During the trial, Varlam's son Abel (Avtandil Makharadze) denies any wrongdoings by his father and his lawyer tries to get Ketevan declared insane. Varlam's grandson Tornike (Merab Ninidze) is shocked by the revelations about the crimes of his grandfather. He ultimately commits suicide. Abel himself then throws Varlam's corpse off a cliff on the outskirts of the town. At the end, the film returns to the scene of the woman preparing a cake. An old woman is asking her at the window whether this is the road that leads to the church. The woman replies that the road is Varlam Street and will not lead to the temple. The old woman replies: \"What good is a road if it doesn't lead to a church?\"",

In Louisiana, they encounter Diana's cousin, Ruth. Married at 12 to an abusive man whose current whereabouts are an increasingly troubling cipher, the domineering Ruth rules over her three adult sons. The sons—Pauly, Tommy, and Mark—are less than perfectly cogent, with equal parts protectiveness and ferocity, while a fourth, disowned son adds to the volatility of the situation.

    "Synopsis": "American architect Stourley Kracklite has been commissioned to construct an exhibition in Rome dedicated to the architecture of the 18th-century French architect, Étienne-Louis Boullée, who until the 20th century remained little known. Kracklite's Italian colleagues express doubts about whether Boullée really belongs in the architectural pantheon; they note that few of his buildings were ever constructed and observe that Boullée was an inspiration for Adolf Hitler's architect Albert Speer. As he works on the exhibition, Kracklite's marriage and health deteriorate. He becomes obsessed with Caesar Augustus, the first emperor of the Roman Empire, after hearing that Augustus's wife, Livia, supposedly poisoned him. Suffering from recurrent stomach pains, he suspects his much younger wife, Louisa, of trying to do the same. Louisa reveals that she is pregnant with Kracklite's child, conceived at the precise moment their train crossed the Italian border. Meanwhile, she has become sexually involved with Caspasian Speckler, the younger co-organiser of the exhibition. We learn that Caspasian has also been siphoning off funds from the exhibition, even as he and his Italian associates undermine Kracklite's authority and confidence. Kracklite himself is seduced by Caspasian's sister Flavia, a photographer in her apartment across from the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana. The two are discovered in flagrante by Caspasian, who threatens to tell Louisa. Louisa leaves Kracklite, who is diagnosed with stomach cancer and given only months to live. The film ends at the exhibition's opening ceremony, nine months after their arrival in Italy. Kracklite, now replaced as director by Caspasian, watches from a high vantage point as Louisa cuts the tape. As she suddenly goes into labor, Kracklite jumps to his death.",

    "film_title": "The Family (1987 film)",
    "Synopsis": "First part (1906) Carlo's baptism serves as a backdrop to introduce the audience to the household and its initial characters. The patriarch of the family, Carlo's grandfather, a retired literature professor, has recently acquired an apartment. Residing with him and his wife are their son Aristide, Carlo's father, a civil servant and amateur painter; Susanna, Aristide's wife, flighty and passionate about opera; Aristide's sisters, Luisa, Margherita, and Millina, who are constantly bickering but inseparable, resigned to spinsterhood in their thirties; and the maid Nunzia along with her young niece Adelina. Also present at the baptism are Aristide's brother Michele, with his wife Ersilia and son Enrico; Nicola, Susanna's younger brother; and Dr. Giordani, a family friend and physician. Second part (1916) Against the background of World War I, Carlo, at the age of ten, along with his three-years-younger brother Giulio and their cousin Enrico, engage in lively play and decide to steal half a lira from Giordani's overcoat, as he rushes to attend to their gravely ill grandfather. Their game is abruptly halted by Susanna, who delivers the news of the grandfather's passing to the children. Subsequently, it is revealed that Giordani was arrested because, lacking that half lira, he couldn't afford tram fare. Aristide becomes incensed and pressures Giulio to confess, while Carlo admits his wrongdoing voluntarily, thus marking the first contrast between the brothers—Carlo being composed and contemplative, Giulio impulsive and restless. A subtle mutual sympathy is hinted at between Millina and Giordani, though it remains undeveloped. Third part (1926) Carlo is attending university and giving private lessons to a high school student named Beatrice, who openly harbors affection for him. However, Carlo finds himself drawn to Beatrice's sister Adriana, a conservatory student who coincidentally visits their home. Enrico, a staunch anti-fascist, departs Rome for Paris. Suddenly, Aristide dies. Adriana confides in Carlo her intention to pursue an advanced course in Milan, despite his wishes to the contrary, valuing her independence above all else. Fourth part (1936) Carlo, now a high school teacher, is married with two children, Paolino and Maddalena; his wife being Beatrice. They receive a visit from Uncle Nicola, a fascist who holds the position of municipal secretary in Macerata. Even Giulio sympathizes with the regime and prepares to depart for the Ethiopian War, despite Adelina's concerns; she has served in their household for years and is romantically involved with him. In contrast, Carlo holds opposing views and, while avoiding active involvement in politics, symbolically abstains from joining the fascist party. Adriana, now a successful concert pianist, calls from Paris, where she claims to have encountered Enrico married to a French woman with a child. Fifth part (1946) Giulio returns from the war physically unharmed but suffering from severe depression, while news arrives that Enrico died in combat in Spain. Adriana revisits the family, accompanied by her French fiancé, Jean-Luc. During dinner, Carlo, blinded by jealousy toward Adriana, engages in a confrontation with Jean-Luc, despite their shared ideologies; Beatrice's calming intervention diffuses the tension. Amidst the wartime hardships, Adelina resigns from her domestic position and turns to the black market with her brothers. One day, she returns to the household bearing various food items as gifts and expresses a desire to see Giulio again, moved by his condition. Sixth part (1956) As summer approaches, the family prepares for a trip to Santa Marinella. Aunt Millina has died, Giulio has wed Adelina, and they have adopted a girl named Marina. Giulio seeks his brother's opinion on an autobiographical novel he intends to publish, though Carlo dismisses its significance. Adriana, passing through Rome, spends a night in the vacant household but rebuffs Carlo's attempt to rekindle their past romance, refusing to be a mistress out of respect for her sister and acknowledging Carlo's reliance on Beatrice's steadfast presence. Meanwhile, Maddalena, just over twenty, falls in love with a union leader named Armando, insisting on marrying him despite her father's objections. During a winter night marked by an unusual heavy snowfall in Rome, Carlo confides his love and respect for Beatrice to her, while in the adjacent room, Armando and Maddalena, newlyweds, already exhibit signs of discord. The final scene bids farewell to Luisa, Margherita, and Susanna, who are all afflicted by dementia, spending their time in another room reciting opera librettos. Seventh part (1966) Amid preparations for his son Carletto's eighth birthday celebration, Maddalena announces her intention to leave Armando for another man. At the party, Paolino meets Marika, a Hungarian woman separated with children who resides in the neighboring building. Juliette, Enrico's widow, along with her daughter Claudine and granddaughter, also named Juliette, make an appearance, as does Giulio and Adelina, grappling with financial woes; Uncle Nicola arrives as well. Giulio suspects that his uncle intends to ask him for the money he had previously lent him, leading to an unwarranted altercation. Eighth part (1976) Carlo, now a widower in retirement, resides alone with Carletto, who, despite his close bond with his grandfather, frequently spends time away. Paolino has married Marika, and the couple invites Carlo to dinner from their balcony across the street, though he politely declines. Adriana also checks in on Carlo, revealing that Beatrice was aware of their tumultuous history but chose to remain silent for the sake of the family. Ninth part (1986) Carlo gathers his relatives to celebrate his eightieth birthday. As each family member arrives—Giulio, Adelina, Marina (now a mother), Paolino, Marika and their children, Maddalena with her second family, Armando, Juliette, Claudine, the other Juliette, Adriana, and many others whose connections to the protagonists are unclear—they come together for a group photograph. Hints of a budding relationship between Carletto and his third cousin Juliette emerge. Despite final disagreements with Adriana and Giulio, the entire family joins in for the commemorative photo.",

Amanda's husband abandoned the family long ago, and her memory of her days as a genteel Southern belle surrounded by devoted beaux may be more romanticized than real. Tom is an aspiring writer who works in a warehouse to support his family, and the banality and boredom of everyday life leads him to spend most of his spare time watching movies in local cinemas at all hours of the night. Amanda is obsessed with finding a proper \"gentleman caller\" for Laura, who spends most of her time with her collection of glass animal figurines. To appease his mother, Tom eventually brings Jim O'Connor home for dinner, but complications arise when Laura realizes he is the man she loved in high school and has thought of ever since.

    "Synopsis": "Newly ordained as a Catholic priest, Donissan is sent to a rural parish under the care of the experienced Menou-Segrais. The young man is tortured by doubts about his vocation and has taken to flagellating himself. When he confesses to Menou-Segaris how unworthy he feels at his chosen task, the older man says it is not too late to choose another career but he can see in Donissan a great power for good. A parishioner called Mouchette, the 16-year-old daughter of a brewer, calls on one of her lovers, a marquis called Cadignan. She says she wants to run away to Paris, but he says he is facing financial ruin and cannot offer much help. He lets her stay the night, however, and in the morning she starts playing with his shotgun. It is loaded and he is killed. She gets out fast, washing his blood off her clothes. She then goes round to another lover, a married doctor called Gallet. After making love, she tells him what she has done and adds that she is pregnant. He says she need not worry about Cadignan, because the death has been certified as suicide, but he is not the father of her child and will not help her with an abortion. Menou-Segrais, worried at his parishioners' discomfort with Donissan, sends the young man to help in another village. Walking there over the fields in the dark, he is joined by a mysterious horse-trader who turns out to be an incarnation of Satan. Unable to seduce Donissan physically or spiritually, he says the young man has the gift of seeing into souls. Donissan faints, only coming to in the morning, when he encounters Mouchette wandering in the fields. He tells her that he can see her life and thoughts and that she must repent for her sin of killing Cadignan. She goes back to her parents' house and cuts her throat with a razor. Fearing the worst, Donissan goes there and finds her body. He carries it bleeding to the church, where he lays it before the altar in the hope that her soul will be saved. This outrageous behaviour earns him a transfer to another parish, where the people begin to recognise that he is a holy man though he is still in spiritual turmoil. A farmer from a neighbouring village asks him to come to his little son who is dying. Arriving too late, his first impulse is to leave but he then realises that the people expect more. Going alone to the bedroom, he lifts the corpse up and, as he prays, the child's eyes open. The strain of his mental torments and the demands of his parishioners make him increasingly ill. One night he is attacked by Satan, and asks God to keep him alive if there is still use for him. He recovers and returns to the church to hear confessions. Menou-Segrais has come over to see how he is and, after the last parishioner leaves, goes to the confessional box. Inside he finds Donissan dead.",

    "Synopsis": "In a Berlin divided by the Berlin Wall, two angels, Damiel and Cassiel, watch the city, unseen and unheard by its human inhabitants. They observe and listen to the thoughts of Berliners, including a pregnant woman in an ambulance on the way to the hospital, a young prostitute standing by a busy road, and a broken man who feels betrayed by his wife. Their raison d'être is, as Cassiel says, to \"assemble, testify, preserve\" reality. Damiel and Cassiel have always existed as angels; they were in Berlin before it was a city, and before there were any humans. Among the Berliners they encounter in their wanderings is an old man named Homer, who dreams of an \"epic of peace\". Cassiel follows the old man as he looks for the then-demolished Potsdamer Platz in an open field, and finds only the graffiti-covered Wall. Although Damiel and Cassiel are pure observers, visible only to children, and incapable of any interaction with the physical world, Damiel begins to fall in love with a profoundly lonely circus trapeze artist named Marion. She lives by herself in a caravan in West Berlin, until she receives the news that her group, the Circus Alekan, will be closing down. Depressed, she dances alone to a concert by Crime & the City Solution, and drifts through the city. Meanwhile, actor Peter Falk arrives in West Berlin to make a film about the city's Nazi past. Falk was once an angel, but, having grown tired of always observing and never experiencing, renounced his immortality to become a participant in the world. Also growing weary of infinity, Damiel longs for the genuineness and limits of human existence. He meets Marion in a dream, and is surprised when Falk senses his presence and tells him about the pleasures of human life. thumb|The graffiti on the Berlin Wall is depicted in the film. Damiel is finally persuaded to shed his immortality. He experiences life for the first time: he bleeds, sees colours, tastes food and drinks coffee. Meanwhile, Cassiel taps into the mind of a young man just about to take his own life by jumping off a building. Cassiel tries to save the young man but is unable to do so, and is left tormented by the experience. Sensing Cassiel's presence, Falk reaches out to him as he had to Damiel, but Cassiel is unwilling to follow their example. Eventually, Damiel meets the trapeze artist Marion at a bar during a concert by Nick Cave, and she greets him and speaks about finally finding a love that is serious and can make her feel complete. The next day, Damiel considers how his time with Marion taught him to feel amazed, and how he has gained knowledge no angel is capable of achieving.",

    "Synopsis": "Nianankoro's father Soma is a part of the order of Komo, who practice magic, but he uses his powers for self-gain. He becomes determined to kill his son after receiving a vision that his son will cause his death. Aided by his mother, Nianankoro steals several of his father's sacred fetishes and leaves his village to seek out his uncle for help. Soma pursues him with the aid of an enchanted pylon that tracks his son's location and breaks all barriers that deter it. As he travels, Nianankoro encounters a hyena who tells him his destiny is to be great. Passing through the territory of the Fulas, he is thought to be a thief and captured. Their king Rouma Boli orders him killed, but Nianankoro creates magic that freezes his guards and declares they cannot kill him. Impressed, King Rouma offers Nianankoro his freedom in exchange for aid against a rival tribe. When the tribe attacks, Nianankoro summons a swarm of bees and a fire that drives their attackers away. The king thanks Nianankoro and asks him to cure his wife Attou's infertility. Nianankoro creates an enchantment, but he and Attou are overcome by lust and sleep together. That night they return to Rouma to confess their crime, and the king reluctantly orders them married and to leave. Nianankoro and Attou continue their travels while his father remains in pursuit. Soma sacrifices an albino man and a wild dog to appease the gods who grant him power to hunt his son. He then meets with the Komo and warns them that Nianankoro intends to disperse their magic for all the people to use. Nianankoro and Attou reach his uncle Djigui, who was blinded long ago when he chose to use the artifact of Kore's Wing for his people. He gives the relic to Nianankoro and tells him and Attou, who is pregnant, that their children will become a nation who will face hardship and be sold in slavery, but ultimately prosper. Taking Kore's wing, Nianankoro leaves to confront his father and gives his cloak to Attou to in turn give to his son. She takes refuge with Djigui as they prepare for incoming devastation. Reaching his father, Nianankoro attempts to reason with him but is dismayed to find his father cannot bear to share his power and only wants him dead. They call upon the power of their artifacts, Soma with his pylon and Nianankoro with Kore's Wing, turning themselves into an elephant and a lion, respectively. The power of Kore creates a blinding wave that kills them both and transforms the land around them into sand. After their deaths, Attou and her young son come to the site and find two eggs. Her son takes the egg of his father and his mother gives him Kore's Wing, and they leave the desert.",

    "Synopsis": "Waldemar Rekowski (Jan Tesarz) is a middle-aged taxicab driver in Warsaw. An overweight and crude man, he enjoys staring at young women. Jacek Łazar (Mirosław Baka) is a 19-year-old drifter who recently arrived in Warsaw from the countryside and is now aimlessly wandering the streets of the city. He seems to take pleasure in causing other people's misfortunes: he throws a stranger into the urinals of a public toilet after being approached sexually; he drops a large stone from a bridge onto a passing vehicle causing an accident; and he scares away pigeons to spite an old lady who was feeding them. Piotr Balicki (Krzysztof Globisz) is a young and idealistic lawyer who has just passed the bar exam. He takes his wife to a café where they discuss their future. At the same café, Jacek is sitting at a table handling a length of rope and a stick which he keeps in his bag. He puts away the rope and stick when he spots two girls playing at the other side of the window and he engages in a game with them. Jacek is later revealed to have been deeply traumatised by the death of his sister. Meanwhile, Waldemar has been driving his taxicab around the city looking for a fare. He stops near the café just as Jacek approaches and enters the cab. He asks to be driven to a remote part of the city near the countryside and insists the driver take a longer and more remote route. At their destination, Jacek murders Waldemar, by strangling him with the rope and then hitting him repeatedly with an iron bar before finally crushing his head with a large rock. Some time later, Jacek is caught and imprisoned. He is interviewed by his criminal defense lawyer, Piotr, for whom this is his first case after finishing his legal studies. Piotr has little chance of winning the case against Jacek because of the strong evidence against his client. In spite of Piotr's efforts, Jacek is found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. Piotr approaches a judge afterwards asking if he could have done more to save his client's life. The judge says that Piotr gave the best argument against the death penalty he has heard in years, but that the legal outcome is correct. On the appointed day, the executioner arrives at the jail and prepares for the hanging. Piotr is at the prison to attend the execution, and an official congratulates him on having just become a father. In the moments before his execution, Jacek reveals to Piotr that his younger sister was killed by a tractor driven by his drunken friend, and that he was drinking with him; he says he never fully recovered from the tragic episode. Jacek then requests that he be given the final space in his family's grave which was reserved for his mother—that he be buried next to his sister and his father. The warden repeatedly asks if they are finished talking; Piotr defiantly says he will never be finished. Jacek gives his last requests to his lawyer, that Piotr retrieves from Jacek's personal effects a photo of his little sister's first communion and give it to his mother. They conclude that things would have turned out differently if the girl had not tragically died. Jacek is then taken from his cell and marched to the execution chamber by several prison guards. The confirmation of his sentence is read to him, as well as the decision to deny clemency. He is given last rites by a priest, and offered a final cigarette by the warden. When he requests to have one without filter instead, the executioner steps forward, lights one of his cigarettes and puts it into Jacek's mouth. Jacek takes a few puffs before it is stubbed out. Just before he is hanged, he breaks free from his guards and yells uncontrollably before his hands are shackled and he is hanged. Afterwards, Piotr drives to an empty field where he sobs.",

    "Synopsis": "Set in Johannesburg in 1963, the film examines the abrupt ending of 13-year-old Molly's blithe childhood when her father, a member of the South African Communist Party, flees into exile. Ostracised by her peers, Molly draws closer to her mother who is part of the campaign against apartheid. Their relationship is challenged by hardship, political intimidation, and the mother's eventual arrest. The film title references both the gap between the mother and her teenage girl, who fails to grasp why their family is so fixated with events beyond their comfortable white suburb, and another separating this world from that of South Africa's poverty-stricken black townships. Essentially, the film is a tribute to Ruth First by her daughter and concludes in a moment of epiphany as Molly comes to terms with her mother's activism and understands that she too must play a part in the struggle against racial injustice.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1939, Kansas City, Missouri, young alto saxophone player Charlie \"Bird\" Parker performs at the Reno Club. However, his rapid and sporadic playing gets him jeered offstage. Moving to New York City, Charlie begins performing at different jazz venues on 52nd Street and meets trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie. While Charlie performs with Dizzy, their specific style of jazz develops a following and is known as \"bebop.\" One evening, Charlie meets Chan Parker, a dancer and jazz lover. Attracted to Chan, Charlie continually asks her out, but she refuses his advances and moves to Chicago, Illinois. Later, Chan returns from Chicago and confesses she is pregnant with another man's child. Upset, Charlie leaves for Los Angeles, California, to perform with Dizzy. One evening, Red Rodney, a Jewish trumpet player, approaches Charlie and tells him he is a fan. Later, Charlie and Dizzy's engagement is cancelled due to a lack of interest in bebop. Charlie stays in Los Angeles, but his addiction to drugs and alcohol worsen, and he is hospitalized for eight months. After Charlie gets clean and is released, Chan obtains a booking at a New York club for him. When he thanks Chan for her help, she introduces him to her daughter, Kim. Later, Charlie learns that his friend, Brewster, is opening a new club and naming it Birdland after Charlie. In need of work and money, Charlie travels to Paris, France, and finds an audience for jazz and bebop. However, he returns to New York and performs at Birdland. Charlie later meets with Red and, while waiting for Birdland to open, offers a job touring with him in the South. Although Red is hesitant about how an interracial band might be received, Charlie assures him no harm will come to them. Arriving at their first engagement, Red sees Charlie has advertised him as being a blues singer named \"Albino Red.\" During the tour, Charlie learns that Red is addicted to heroin and insists that he stop using drugs. Returning to New York, Charlie and Red perform together for Birdland's grand opening. Afterward, authorities pick up Red for drug possession. Charlie continues to perform at Birdland and other New York clubs. Chan and Kim move in with Charlie, and he and Chan have two children of their own: son Baird, and daughter Pree. Some time later, Charlie is arrested for drug possession and put on probation. He loses his cabaret card, leaving him unable to perform in New York, and moves to Los Angeles in order to find work. He reconnects with Dizzy, who sees that he is using drugs again. Charlie later learns that Pree has died from an illness and returns home for her funeral. Depressed by Pree's death and his faltering career, Charlie tries to kill himself by drinking iodine, but survives. After Chan has him committed to a hospital psychiatric ward, she is advised to send Charlie to a state facility for shock treatments. She worries that such treatments might rob him of his creative abilities. After Charlie is released, Chan convinces him to move their family to upstate New York. Charlie later returns to the city for an audition set up by Brewster, but becomes distracted seeing all the former jazz clubs on 52nd Street have been turned into strip clubs. Missing the audition and embarrassed to tell Chan, Charlie goes to the apartment of Baroness Nica, a wealthy jazz music patron, and soon passes out. A doctor arrives and advises Charlie to go to the hospital, but he refuses. Later as he watches television with the Baroness, Charlie suffers a heart attack and dies at the age of 34.",

    "Synopsis": "An adult woman named France walks down a road toward Douala in Cameroon. She is picked up by William J. Park, an African American who has moved to Africa and is driving to Limbe with his son. As they ride, France's mind drifts and we see her as a young girl in Mindif in the northern part of French Cameroon in 1957, where her father was a colonial administrator for the French Empire. The story is told through the eyes of young France, showing her friendship with the \"houseboy,\" Protée, as well as the sexual tension between Protée and her mother, Aimée. The conflict of the film comes from the discomfort created as France and her mother attempt to move past the established boundaries between themselves and the native Africans. This is brought to a head through Luc Segalen, a Western drifter who stays with the Dalens family after a small aircraft crashes nearby. He acknowledges Aimée's attraction to Protée in the presence of other black servants. This later results in a fight between Luc and Protée, which Protée wins. During the fight, Aimée sits nearby, unseen by the two. She attempts to seduce Protée after Luc has left but he rejects her advance. Aimée consequently asks her husband to remove him from the house. Protée is moved from his in-house job to working outdoors in the garage as a mechanic. Towards the end of the film, France's father reveals a central theme of the film as he explains to her what the horizon is. He tells her that it is a line that is there but not there, a symbol for the boundaries that exist in the country between rich and poor, master and servant, white and black, coloniser and colonised, male and female; a line that is always visible but impossible to approach or pass.",

    "film_title": "Drowning by Numbers",
    "Synopsis": "The film opens with a little girl jumping rope and counting stars to \"a hundred\". The film's plot centres on three married women — a grandmother, her daughter, and her niece — each named Cissie Colpitts. As the story progresses, each woman successively drowns her husband. The three Cissie Colpittses are played by Joan Plowright, Juliet Stevenson and Joely Richardson, while Bernard Hill plays the coroner, Madgett, who is cajoled into covering up the three crimes. The structure, with similar stories repeated three times, is reminiscent of a fairy tale, most specifically 'The Billy Goats Gruff', because Madgett is constantly promised greater rewards as he tries his luck with each of the Cissies in turn. The link to folklore is further established by Madgett's son Smut, who recites the rules of various unusual games played by the characters as if they were ancient traditions. Many of these games are invented for the film, including: *Bees in the Trees *Dawn Card Castles *Deadman's Catch *Flights of Fancy (or Reverse Strip Jump) *The Great Death Game *Hangman's Cricket *The Hare and Hounds *Sheep and Tides In Drowning by Numbers, number-counting, the rules of games and the repetitions of the plot are all devices which emphasise structure. Through the course of the film each of the numbers 1 to 100 appear, the large majority in sequence, often seen in the background, sometimes printed on cattle, sometimes spoken by the characters. The repetitive, obsessive motif of the film echoes that of the soundtrack by Michael Nyman. The film is set and was shot in and around Southwold, Suffolk, England, with key landmarks such as the Victorian water tower, Southwold Lighthouse, and the estuary of the River Blyth clearly identifiable.",

    "Synopsis": "The Roberts family farm in Iowa is a prosperous one. Frank Roberts, Sr. and his two young sons are even visited there by Nikita Khrushchev during the Soviet Union premier's tour of the Midwestern United States in 1959. The farmland worked on by three-generations of Roberts' used to be top-notch, but costs have steadily risen while crop prices have barely budged, so many farmers have been failing. A deluge of rain has ruined the crops. They must resort to desperate measures, they sell practically all their personal belongings in a yard sale, just to pay their bills. Anger in Frank Jr. builds when the bank forecloses, until he ultimately suggests to younger brother Terry that they set fire to the farm, rather than let the bank seize control of it. As the brothers take to the road, becoming thieves, the story of their action at home strikes a chord with neighbors and strangers who offer them shelter or even a hideout when the law's in pursuit. Along the way, the Roberts brothers encounter a wide variety of people. Terry meets, and falls for, his soulmate, Sally (Penelope Ann Miller); a stripper introduces them to Maxwell, a reporter who wants to tell their story before the law catches up with them. Cocky Frank decides they go to a local fair. He's power-drunk on the press, literally drunk and loud when they start the ox pull competition. When he sees the struggling ox, he tries to stop the driver, then puts the animal out of its misery. The police are alerted, but they run. The next day, Frank leaves Terry sleeping in the car goes in to rob the bank, but Terry stops him and they escape. That afternoon they find work with a fellow corn harvester, but they are spotted and get the cops on their tail. Finally Terry, with the help of Sally's lawyer father, decides to stay, and Frank drives off in the distance.",

    "film_title": "Pascali's Island (film)",
    "Synopsis": "In 1908 at Nisi, a small Greek Island under Ottoman rule, Turkish officials, Greek rebels, German emissaries, and other foreign mercenaries mingle as they all try to keep the upper hand in that remote part of the crumbling Ottoman Empire. Basil Pascali, a half-British half-Maltese man, considers himself a local feature on the island. Since his arrival twenty years before, he has spied for the Sultan, sending detailed reports about suspicious activities. He has no idea whether anybody reads his observations as he never receives a reply, but his payment still arrives regularly so he continues his work as an informant with unfailing eagerness. Pascali's suspicions are aroused by the arrival of Anthony Bowles, a British archaeologist, whose purpose in visiting the island is unclear. Basil quickly befriends Bowles at the hotel’s lounge bar and offers his services as an interpreter. Pascali introduces Bowles to his close friend Lydia Neumann, an Austrian painter resident on the island. While Lydia and Anthony chat, Pascali slips into Bowles' hotel room to investigate. In Bowles' suitcase, Pascali finds a carved marble head but nothing that reveals Bowles' purpose on the island. Needing help arranging a deal to lease some land from the local Pasha, Bowles hires Pascali as an interpreter. At Bowles' insistence, the agreement is sealed officially with a contract. Suspecting something unusual, Pascali warns Bowles that the Pasha is not a man to be crossed. Meanwhile, the Turkish authorities tell Pascali that he will be held responsible if Bowles fails to make the full payment. Spying on Bowles, Pascali finds the archaeologist beginning an affair with Lydia, swimming naked with her in a remote cove. Pascali is evidently secretly in love with Lydia and envies the handsome British archaeologist. Aroused by the experience, Pascali relieves his sexual frustration at a Turkish bath. Unexpectedly, Bowles wants to change the terms of his contract: he says he has found some small archaeological objects of great significance and wants the right to excavate to be included in a new lease. Once again Pascali serves as interpreter and intermediary with the Pasha, who seeing the objects, a gold necklace, and the antique statue's head, refuses to grant the excavation rights. The Pasha wants to buy the lease back; Bowles asks for a much larger sum than he originally paid. Pascali tells Bowles that he does not need to keep up the pretense with him: he knows that the statue's head was brought by Bowles to swindle the Turkish authorities, enticing them to buy the lease at a higher amount. Pascali asks for part of Bowles' earnings in exchange for his silence. Bowles agrees. The plot becomes more complicated when Bowles makes a genuinely important archaeological discovery: a large bronze statue of a boy from Greek times in pristine condition. Deciding to retrieve the statue secretly, Bowles asks Pascali for help in delaying the closing of the lease deal for two more days. Pascali helps him not only with the Turkish authorities but also with the excavation. He intends to use the money Bowles offers him to travel to Constantinople and find out what has happened to his reports, the only thing that has given meaning to his life. Both Lydia and Bowles try to persuade Pascali to leave the island, as the fall of the Ottoman Empire is imminent. Believing, however, that Bowles is going to swindle him over the money, Pascali denounces him to the Turkish authorities. He guides them that night to the excavation site, but as Bowles and Lydia are planning to leave the island, with the help of the Americans, taking the statue with them, they are all shot and killed by the Turks. Pascali, already regretting having betrayed his friends, returns home to find his payment and a letter from Bowles trying to help him leave the island. Pascali is devastated over his useless misreading of the situation. He concludes that his reports were neither read nor kept. He loved both Lydia and Bowles but caused their deaths. As the Ottoman Empire crumbles, the only thing left for Pascali is to wait for the Greeks to come for him.",

    "Synopsis": "Members of the Symbionese Liberation Army kidnap publishing magnate heiress Patty Hearst from her Berkeley apartment and take her to their safe house, where she is kept blindfolded in a closet. Her captivity is interrupted by brief lessons in the SLA's teachings and, eventually, offers of sex. She is told by the group's leader, \"General Field Marshall\" Cinque, that she is being used for bargaining for the release of two captive comrades, an offer eventually refused by the state. In its place, the SLA devise a program for the Hearsts to donate $70 to every poor Californian. As negotiations begin to break down in this recent attempt, Cinque informs Patty that the War Council has to decide what to do with her. As she is slowly ingratiated in the group, she is given the choice to join or go home, though the latter option is reinforced with a bottle tapping on her leg, a reminder to \"join or die\". After undergoing a series of tests, Patty is brought into the SLA as a member and given the name Tania. She poses for pictures with the group and records lines to give to the media while undergoing military drills. The group plans a bank robbery and pick the Hibernia Bank as the site. Though the robbery is successful, Patty is unable to recite her prepared speech. The group acquires a vehicle from a family of Black Muslim neighbors and move to Los Angeles. While out with Teko and Yolanda, Teko is nearly arrested for stealing and Patty shoots at the police to enable their escape. Hiding out at a motel, the group learn that the SLA's main safe house has been raided and watch the subsequent shootout on television, in which all the members besides themselves are killed. The trio move to Pennsylvania to stay at the home of SLA member Wendy, who is somewhat disillusioned with the cause following the arrest of a comrade. They meet up with an SLA chapter in San Francisco and continue performing bank robberies and bombing police cars. Teko and Yolanda split from the group in search of a black leader and the apartment is later raided by the FBI, leading to Patty and Wendy's arrest. Patty's attorney has psychiatrists subject her to a range of probing questions about her captivity. Yolanda, situated in a cell adjacent to Patty's, tells her that they should have killed her a long time ago. In the subsequent trial, Patty is cross-examined and she is found guilty on the charges of bank robbery and using a firearm during the commission of a felony. Later, Patty is visited by her father in prison, where she tells him of her plan to get her conviction commuted, with hope of a presidential pardon in future. She bitterly muses that, in the eyes of the public, the crime she was truly guilty of was surviving her ordeal.",

Lasse finds it difficult to secure work, given his advanced age and Pelle's youth. They are forced to toil at a large farm, where they are generally mistreated by the managers. The managers work under the tyrannical Kongstrup, who has a history of affairs with female employees, resulting in illegitimate children. Among such children is Rud, who befriends Pelle and helps him learn Danish. Eventually, Pelle becomes more confident and begins attending school, though he is still discriminated against as a foreigner. Pelle also befriends the Swedish worker Erik, who is constantly harassed for alleged sloth. Erik shares his dream of visiting America, China, and \"Negroland\" with Pelle, aiming to \"conquer\" the world. Rud runs away after poor performance at school, but Pelle begins to excel.

At the farm, Erik is injured and disabled after attempting to lead a revolt against management. Mrs. Olsen's husband returns from his voyage, and Lasse is overcome with depression and alcoholism. The two appeal to the Kongstrups for aid against their harassment. Mrs. Kongstrup offers support, but her husband remains silent. Pelle receives a promotion but, after witnessing Erik forced from the farm, vows to leave. Lasse initially resolves to go with him, before deciding he is too old to travel. He sends Pelle alone into the world.",

Long sought after by authorities for his subversive writings, Zénon is arrested. He is tried by a court of the Inquisition and accused of witchcraft, murder, and unnatural relations.

She returns to the city by boat and gets into a black rain, a fallout resulting from the bombing. After Yasuko is re-united with her uncle and aunt, the trio heads for the factory where her uncle works to escape the spreading fires. Their route is marked by ruins, scattered corpses, and severely burnt survivors. 5 years later, Yasuko lives with her uncle, aunt and her uncle's mother in Fukuyama. As she has long reached the age when a woman should get married by tradition, Shigematsu and Shigeko try to find a husband for her. However, all prospects' families withdraw their proposal when they hear of Yasuko's presence in Hiroshima on the day of the bombing, fearing that she might become ill or be unable to give birth to healthy children. Yasuko eventually accepts her situation and decides to stay with her uncle's family, even when her father, who remarried, offers her to live in his house. Shigematsu witnesses his friends, all hibakusha suffering from radiation sickness, die one after another, while also his, his wife's and niece's health is slowly deteriorating. Yasuko starts feeling close to Yuichi, a young man from the neighbourhood who is suffering from war trauma. When Yuichi's mother asks for Shigematsu's approval of her son marrying Yasuko, he is indignant at first because of Yuichi's mental illness, but later agrees. Shortly after, Yasuko, already suffering from a tumor, starts losing her hair and is sent to the hospital. Shigematsu watches the departing ambulance, hoping for a rainbow to appear which would indicate that she will recover.",

    "film_title": "Cinema Paradiso",
    "Synopsis": "In 1988 Rome, Salvatore Di Vita, a famous film director, returns home late one evening, where his girlfriend sleepily tells him that his mother called to say someone named Alfredo has died. Salvatore shies from committed relationships and has not been to his home village of Giancaldo, Sicily, in thirty years. As his girlfriend asks him who Alfredo was, Salvatore is unable to fall asleep and flashes back to his childhood. A few years after World War II, eight-year-old Salvatore is the mischievous, intelligent son of a war widow. Nicknamed Totò, he discovers a love for films and spends every free moment at the local movie house, Cinema Paradiso. Although they initially start on tense terms, he develops a friendship with the middle-aged projectionist, Alfredo, who often lets him watch films from the projection booth. During the shows, the audience can be heard booing because there are missing sections, causing the films to suddenly jump, bypassing scenes with romantic kisses or embraces. The local priest, the owner of the cinema, had ordered these sections to be censored, and the deleted scenes are cut from the film reels by Alfredo and piled on the projection room floor, where Alfredo keeps them until he can splice them back in for the film to be sent to the next town. Alfredo eventually teaches Salvatore how to operate the film projector. One day, Cinema Paradiso catches fire as Alfredo is projecting The Firemen of Viggiù after hours, on the wall of a nearby house. Salvatore saves Alfredo's life, but not before a reel of nitrate film explodes in Alfredo's face, leaving him permanently blind. The movie house is rebuilt by a town citizen, Ciccio Spaccafico, using his winnings from a football lottery. Salvatore, still a child, is hired as the new projectionist, as only he knows how to run the machines. About a decade later, Salvatore, now in high school, is still operating the projector at the \"Nuovo Cinema Paradiso\". His relationship with the blind Alfredo has strengthened, and Salvatore often looks to him for help – advice that Alfredo often dispenses by quoting classic films. Salvatore has been experimenting with filming, using a home movie camera; doing this he has met, and captured on film, a girl named Elena Mendola, daughter of a wealthy banker, and has fallen in love with her. Salvatore woos – and wins – Elena's heart, only to lose her due to her father's disapproval. As Elena and her family move away, Salvatore leaves town for compulsory military service. His attempts to write to Elena are fruitless; his letters are returned as undeliverable. Upon his return from the military, Alfredo urges Salvatore to leave Giancaldo permanently, counseling that the town is too small for Salvatore to ever find his dreams. Moreover, the old man tells him, once Salvatore leaves, he must pursue his destiny wholeheartedly, never looking back and never returning, even to visit; he must never give in to nostalgia or even write or think about them. They tearfully embrace, and Salvatore leaves to pursue his future as a filmmaker. Back in the present, Salvatore realizes that he is very satisfied with his life from a professional point of view but not from a personal one, so decides to return home to attend Alfredo's funeral. Though the town has changed greatly, he now understands why Alfredo thought it was important that he leave. Alfredo's widow tells him that the old man followed Salvatore's successes with pride and he left him something: an unlabeled film reel and the old stool that Salvatore once stood on to operate the projector. Salvatore learns that Cinema Paradiso is to be demolished to make way for a parking lot. At the funeral, he recognizes the faces of many people who attended the cinema when he was the projectionist. Salvatore returns to Rome where he watches Alfredo's reel and discovers that it comprises all the romantic scenes that the priest had ordered Alfredo to cut from the films; Alfredo had spliced every kiss together to form a single reel. Totò comes to peace with his past, smiling with tears in his eyes.",

As of July 21, 2021, the word count for this plot summary is 700 words. --> Twenty-five-year-old Mookie lives in Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, with his sister Jade, has a toddler son named Hector with his Latina girlfriend Tina, and works as a delivery man at a pizzeria owned by Italian-American Salvatore \"Sal\" Frangione. Sal's oldest son, Pino, is a racist who holds contempt for all the neighborhood blacks. Sal's younger son, Vito, is friends with Mookie, which Pino feels undermines their fraternal bond. Other residents of the neighborhood include friendly drunk Da Mayor; Mother Sister, who observes the block from her brownstone; Radio Raheem, who blasts Public Enemy's \"Fight the Power\" on his boombox; Buggin' Out, a fast-talking young man who talks about black civil rights to anyone who will listen; Smiley, a mentally disabled man who meanders around town with hand-colored pictures of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.; and local DJ Mister Señor Love Daddy. At Sal's, Buggin' Out questions Sal about his \"Wall of Fame\", which is decorated with photos of famous Italian-Americans. He demands that Sal put up pictures of black celebrities since the pizzeria's customers are mostly black. Sal refuses, feeling he has no obligation to put other photos on the wall, and ejects him. Buggin' Out attempts to start boycotting the pizzeria, but only Raheem joins him. During the day, local teenagers open a fire hydrant to beat the heat wave before white police officers Mark Ponte and Gary Long intervene. Mookie confronts Pino about his contempt towards African Americans. Later, Pino expresses his hatred for African Americans to Sal, who insists on keeping the business in the majority African-American neighborhood. That night, Buggin' Out and Raheem march into Sal's and demand that the Wall of Fame include Black celebrities. Sal demands that Raheem turn his boombox off, but he refuses. Buggin' Out badmouths Sal and threatens to shutter the pizzeria for good. Finally, Sal snaps and smashes Raheem's boombox with a baseball bat. Enraged, Raheem attacks Sal. A fight ensues that spills out into the street, attracting a crowd. The police arrive, including Long and Ponte, who break up the fight and apprehend Raheem and Buggin' Out. As the officers attempt to restrain Raheem, Long begins choking him with his nightstick. Though Ponte and the onlookers plead for him to stop, Long tightens his choke-hold on Raheem, killing him. Attempting to save face, the officers hide his body in the back of a police car and drive off. The onlookers blame Sal for Raheem's death, despite Da Mayor's unsuccessful attempts to defuse the situation. Suddenly, Mookie grabs a trash can and throws it through the pizzeria's window, sparking the crowd to destroy it. Smiley sets the building ablaze, and Da Mayor pulls Sal, Pino, and Vito away from the mob, which turns toward the Korean market across the street to destroy it, too. Sonny, the owner, eventually dissuades the group. The police return with the fire department and riot patrols to extinguish the fire and disperse the crowd. The firefighters, after several warnings to the crowd, turn their hoses on the mob, enraging them and causing more arrests. The next day, Mookie returns to Sal and demands his weekly pay. After an argument, Sal pays Mookie, and the two part. Mookie leaves to visit Hector as Mister Señor Love Daddy announces that the mayor of New York City has founded a committee to investigate the incident and dedicates a song to Raheem. An epilogue shows two quotations that demonstrate the dichotomy of the film's theme—one from Martin Luther King, who claims violence is never justified, and one from Malcolm X, who claims violence is \"intelligence\" when used in self-defense—and dedicates the film to six black people, five killed by police officers (Eleanor Bumpurs, Arthur Miller Jr., Edmund Perry, Yvonne Smallwood, and Michael Stewart) and one killed by a white mob (Michael Griffith).",

    "Synopsis": "Seventh-day Adventist Church pastor Michael Chamberlain, his wife Lindy Chamberlain, their two sons, and their nine-week-old daughter Azaria are on a camping holiday in the Australian Outback. With the baby sleeping in their tent, the family enjoys a barbecue with their fellow campers when a cry is heard. Lindy returns to the tent to check and is certain she sees a dingo with something in its mouth running off as she approaches. When she discovers the infant missing, everyone joins forces to search for her, without success. It is assumed what Lindy saw was the animal carrying Azaria, and a subsequent inquest rules her account of events as true. However, the tide of public opinion soon turns against the Chamberlains. For many, Lindy seems too stoic, cold-hearted, and accepting of the disaster that has befallen the family. Gossip about her begins to swell and soon is accepted as statements of fact. The couple's religious beliefs are not widely practiced in the country, and when the media report a rumour that the name Azaria means \"sacrifice in the wilderness\", the public is quick to believe they decapitated their baby with a pair of scissors as part of a bizarre religious rite. Law-enforcement officials find new witnesses, forensics experts, and circumstantial evidence and reopen the investigation, eventually charging Lindy with murder. Seven months pregnant, she ignores her attorneys' advice to play to the jury's sympathy and appears stoic on the stand, convincing some onlookers of her guilt. As the trial progresses, Michael's faith in his religion and his belief in his wife falter, and he stumbles through his testimony, suggesting he is concealing the truth. In October 1982, Lindy is found guilty and immediately sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour, while Michael is found guilty as an accessory and given an 18-month suspended sentence. More than three years later, while searching for the body of an English tourist who fell from Uluru, police discover a dingo lair with clothing that is identified as the jacket Lindy had insisted Azaria was wearing over her jumpsuit, which had been recovered early in the investigation. Lindy is immediately released from prison, the case is reopened and all convictions against the Chamberlains are overturned. The film ends with Michael commenting on the ongoing battle to clear the family's name.",

Raised as the pampered son of a merchant, Francis goes off to war, only to return with a profound horror for the society which generated such suffering. In one scene, as an act of renunciation, he strips himself of his fine clothing in front of his father, and leaves the house naked and barefoot, joining the lepers and beggars in the poor section of town. A series of episodes from Francis' life follows, rather than a coherent narrative, until his final days when he receives the stigmata, the wounds Christ suffered at the crucifixion.",

    "film_title": "Jesus of Montreal",
    "Synopsis": "In Montreal, an unknown actor named Daniel Coulombe is hired by a Roman Catholic pilgrimage site (\"le sanctuaire\") to present a passion play in its gardens. The priest, Father Leclerc, asks him to \"modernize\" the classic play the church has been using, which he considers dated. Despite working with material others consider to be clichéd, Daniel is inspired and carries out intensive academic research, consulting archaeology to check the historicity of Jesus and drawing on supposed information on Jesus in the Talmud, using the Talmud name Yeshua Ben Pantera for Jesus, whom he portrays. He includes arguments that the biological father of Jesus was a Roman soldier who left Palestine shortly after impregnating the unwed Mary. He assembles his cast, drawn from insignificant and disreputable backgrounds (one being a man who does pornographic voiceovers), and moves in with two of them, Constance and Mireille. When the play is performed, the audience is thrilled; the show receives excellent reviews. Father Leclerc, however, regards it as controversial and an affront to official Catholic doctrine. He angrily distances himself from Daniel. The actor's life is further complicated when he attends one of Mireille's auditions. Mireille is told to remove her top, causing an outburst from Daniel in which he damages equipment and assaults a director, resulting in criminal charges. When the higher authorities of the Roman Catholic Church strongly object to his interpretation of Jesus and security forces stop a performance, the audience and actors oppose them and Daniel is injured in an ensuing accident. Daniel is first taken by ambulance to an overrun Catholic hospital where he is neglected. He leaves and collapses on a Montreal Metro platform. The same ambulance takes him to the Jewish General Hospital. Despite immediate, skilled, and energetic efforts by the doctors and nurses, he is pronounced brain dead. His doctor asks for the consent of his friends, since he has no known relatives, to take his organs for donation, stating that they would have been able to save him if he had been brought in half an hour earlier. After his death, his eyes and heart are used to restore the health of other patients. In the wake of his death, Daniel's friends start a theatre company to carry on his work.",

    "Synopsis": "In southern California, Tim Doolan is released from juvenile detention, and departs with his mother, Felicia, and her new husband, Barton Marks, arriving at a psychiatric facility for troubled youth called Valley Acres. Tim refuses to acclimate to the establishment and when he becomes belligerent, the hospital's orderlies are forced to restrain him. He remembers a night from the prior month when he, his half-brother Andy, and their gang, the D.A.B.’s, entered into an altercation with rivals from the 10th St. Gang. Afterwards, Tim spent the night with Cheryl Anderson, the girlfriend of his friend, Link; Cheryl proceeded to drive her mother’s convertible into their swimming pool out of frustration with her chronic alcoholism. The following morning, Tim's abusive estranged father Richard arrived at the police station with a gun and narcotics he located in Tim’s bedroom. With Felicia away for several weeks on her honeymoon with Barton, and Richard unwilling to watch him, Tim was left unsupervised, and a judge ordered him to a juvenile detention center until she returned. Later, at Valley Acres, psychiatrist Dr. Charles Loftis meets with Tim, recognizing that the adolescent does not deserve to be there. However, Tim is barred from leaving the premises, and begins attending group sessions with others, including Cheryl, who apologizes to Tim for getting him into trouble, as her mother had her committed to the facility. Seeing an opportunity, Tim climbs over the wall and unsuccessfully attempts escape. Loftis promises to assist Tim if the boy remains in the compound. Sometime later, Tim has sex with Cheryl in a shower stall. During family counseling with Loftis, Richard verbally abuses Felicia, and insults Barton; Loftis scolds the adults, reminding them to focus on Tim. Cheryl is soon released, despite Loftis’s belief that she needs to remain. Hoping to reunite with Cheryl, Tim decides to be on his best behavior so that he can earn his release. After receiving off-ground privileges, Tim’s half-brother, Andy, arrives to take him out for the day. Arriving at Felicia’s house, Tim learns that Barton sent him to Valley Acres and has turned his bedroom into an office. He storms out and visit Cheryl, who is now living alone in her mother's empty house, as her mother has sold it following her committal to Valley Acres. He becomes worried when he discovers that Cheryl has turned to drugs, and after obtaining Loftis’s address, takes Cheryl to get help. However, Loftis, unhappy about the house call, accuses Tim of going AWOL and reports him to Valley Acres, but Tim returns to the facility independently. Feeling betrayed, Tim vandalizes the facility, spray-painting graffiti on the walls. Loftis arrives and encourages Tim to fight him, allowing the youth to release his pent-up energy before calming down and then painting over the graffiti. Andy telephones Tim, furious about his absence from a gang fight, and pressures him into partaking in a rematch fight the following weekend. Learning en route to the destination of Andy’s plot to engage in a drive-by shooting on the 10th St. Gang, he initially refuses to participate, but Andy coerces him into pointing the gun at the rival gang leader. However, as Andy drives by the rival gang, Tim fires at the ground instead. While fleeing, Andy crashes into another vehicle, and Tim escapes from both the scene of the collision and the rival gang as Andy frantically drives away. He searches for Andy at Richard’s house but encounters Richard, demanding to converse with him, and father and son finally embrace each other. Andy arrives outside with Cheryl in tow, and Tim holds him at gunpoint and fires shots near his head, frightening him. Ignoring Cheryl's attempts at reasoning with him, Tim escapes to Loftis’s house. However, Loftis, drunk and unsympathetic after having recently separated from his wife Judith, demands that Tim depart the premises, but the youth falls asleep in a spare bedroom and the following morning, asks Loftis to take him in, admitting that he has been deprived of a stable home environment throughout his entire youth. Loftis informs Tim that Felicia has inquired about him, and drops him off at her house, promising to ensure he will ultimately never return to Valley Acres.",

    "Synopsis": "Hire (originally Hirovitch) is an isolated bachelor who works as a tailor, with no human contact outside his job beyond occasional visits to a brothel, a skating rink and a bowling alley. Though he talks to no-one and says he dislikes people, he observes them closely and in particular is struck by a young woman called Alice who moves into the building opposite and never closes her blinds. He spends his evenings secretly watching her, with more than just curiosity or lust because he has fallen in love with her. One evening the dead body of a young woman is found nearby and, watching his neighbour, Hire sees her boyfriend Émile, a petty criminal, trying to wash blood off his raincoat and hiding a handbag. Hire says nothing to the police, because he wants to protect Alice, but then the police start investigating him, with the inspector trying to trick and intimidate him into confessing to murder. While watching Alice one night from his darkened apartment, a flash of lightning reveals his staring face. Alice is at first horrified at being spied on and then is intrigued at who he can be. She engineers a meeting on the landing outside his flat, but he is too embarrassed to acknowledge her. Next evening she looks openly back at him and indicates that she is coming over. When she comes over, he rejects her advances. In the end, he agrees to meet her at the railway station restaurant, where he declares his love for her. He says he owns a small house in Switzerland to which the two of them could flee, which would separate her from the murderer Émile, with whose crime she is complicit, and get the police off Hire's back. He buys two train tickets, giving one to Alice, and writes a letter to the police inspector denouncing Émile. At the station, Alice does not turn up, so he returns to his apartment. The inspector is there with Alice, who has placed the murdered woman's handbag among Hire's things for the inspector to find. Hire makes a break for it, but falls from the roof and is killed. Only later does the inspector read the letter and find Émile's bloodstained raincoat.",

    "Synopsis": "The film consists of three stories that take place on the same night in downtown Memphis. The three stories are linked together by the Arcade Hotel, a run-down flophouse presided over by a night clerk and a bellboy, where the principal characters in each story spend a part of the night. Every room in the hotel lacks a television (as is noted in each story), but is adorned with a portrait of Elvis Presley. The first story features Mitsuko and Jun, a young Japanese couple from Yokohama making a pilgrimage to Memphis during a trip across America. Mitsuko is obsessed with Elvis, and has put together a scrapbook detailing her belief that the singer has a mystical connection to other cultural figures ranging from Madonna to the Buddha to the Statue of Liberty. The story follows the couple as they travel from the train station, through downtown Memphis and a tour of Sun Records, to the Arcade Hotel, before they eventually depart to board the train again. The second story is about an Italian widow, Luisa, who is stranded in Memphis while escorting her husband's coffin back to Italy. Luisa shares a room at the hotel with Dee Dee, a young woman who has just left her British boyfriend (Johnny from the final story), and plans to leave the city in the morning. Luisa is kept awake by Dee Dee's constant talking. After Dee Dee finally goes to sleep, Luisa is visited by an apparition of Elvis Presley. The final story introduces Johnny. Upset after losing his job and his girlfriend, Johnny – called Elvis, much to his chagrin – drunkenly brandishes a gun in a bar before leaving with his friend Will Robinson and his ex-girlfriend's brother, Charlie, who believes Johnny to be his brother-in-law. They stop at a liquor store, which Johnny robs, shooting its clerk in the process. Fearing the consequences, Johnny, Will, and Charlie retire to the hotel to hide out for the night; there, they all become increasingly intoxicated. Charlie realizes that Will shares the same name as the character Will Robinson from the television show Lost in Space, which Johnny has never heard of. Charlie and Will proceed to tell him about the show, and Will comments that the title describes how he feels then with Charlie and Johnny: lost in space. The next morning, Charlie discovers that Johnny is not really his brother-in-law, which angers him because of what they have been through. Johnny attempts to shoot himself, and while struggling to prevent him, Charlie is accidentally shot in the leg. Leaving the hotel, the three rush to escape a police car that is not even looking for them. The closing credits show the train, the airport, and final views of the characters from the first two stories.",

    "film_title": "Rosalie Goes Shopping",
    "Synopsis": "Rosalie Greenspace is an expatriate German woman living in rural Arkansas with her eccentric American husband Ray (Liebling), who works as a crop-duster airplane pilot. They have seven children: Kindi, the eldest son who is a US Army soldier stationed out of state; Barbara, the eldest daughter who is a good-natured overachieving college student; Schatzi, an underachieving high school student; Schnucki, a flamboyant gourmet cook; teenage twin girls who are never named; and Herzi, the youngest child. Rosalie loves to shop too much to let a little thing like no money stop her. Every day she goes on lavish shopping sprees in the nearby small town of Stuttgart (the same name of her hometown in West Germany) where she forges checks, uses false credit cards, and other means to supplement her livelihood with purchases of fancy foods for Kindi to cook and various clothing and appliances for her large house. A devout Catholic, she has a twisted view on religion when she goes every day to a small church and confesses her sins of stealing and swindling to a local priest, believing that if she confesses her crimes to her priest, her \"sins\" will not become sins anymore. Schatzi is dating April, a girl from his high school whom he brings over to the house one day to meet the family for dinner. April is awkward about the Greenspace family's antics as well as their obsession with watching videotaped TV commercials as their only form of entertainment. She soon leaves Schatzi, finding his family too weird. Rosalie's parents come for a visit one day from West Germany, and Kindi also arrives for a visit after taking a leave of absence from the military. During the week of the visits, both of Rosalie's parents, as well as Kindi, find her self-indulgent spending of other people's money illegal, but Rosalie appears oblivious to her own actions. However, when the local shopkeepers no longer take her bad checks or bad credit cards, Rosalie is reduced to stealing from her eldest daughter, Barbara's, checking account to buy gifts for her parents, which earns Barbara's wrath and contempt as she finally realizes that her mother is out of control with stealing and spending. After Rosalie's parents leave to return to West Germany, and Kindi returns to the Army, Rosalie is left all by herself as she ponders an end to her spending lifestyle. Rosalie is even forced to abandon her daily food shopping sprees to purchase expensive food for Schnucki to cook and instead is forced to bring home cheap fast food and take-out pizza for the family in place of the fancy daily dinners that Schnucki prepares. In the meantime, Ray begins having problems with his eyesight and nearly crashes his crop-duster biplane during a routine run which gets him fired from the aviation company he works at. Life now begins looking pretty bleak for Rosalie until Barbara pushes her into buying a \"guilt gift\" of a PC; a modern-for-the-time desktop computer, complete with a modem. After first using the computer for some Internet and Prodigy surfing skills, Rosalie gets an inspiration when she has a talk with her friendly mailman, where after she confides in him about her financial predicament, he tells her: \"when you're $100,000 in debt, it's your problem. But when you're $1 million in debt, it's the bank's\". Impersonating a wealthy German businesswoman, Rosalie travels to the state capital of Little Rock and meets with a bank president for a large loan to open a new multinational corporation which she receives due to her falsified credentials she forged. Afterwards, Rosalie now has access to the bank's financial records and, with the help of her new PC, she evolves from a \"master shopper\" into a \"master hacker\", and Rosalie is soon back spending money once again. As the film comes to an end, Rosalie, using her new ill-gotten wealth of $2 million that she steals from the large bank, buys for Ray a new crop-dusting airplane so he can open his own crop-dusting business, and has him visit an eye doctor where he gets a pair of eyeglasses which cures him of his vision problem. She also goes back to her church where she confesses her latest crimes to the bewildered priest and plots to flee the country with her family with her new millions to use abroad. As a farewell gift for the priest, she purchases a large and brand-new copper bell for the church.",

    "film_title": "Sex, Lies, and Videotape",
    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 to 700 words. --> Ann Bishop Mullany lives in Baton Rouge, unhappily but comfortably married to John, a successful lawyer. She is in therapy, where she reveals that she is repulsed by the idea of him touching her. Graham Dalton, an old close college friend of John and now a drifter with some money saved up, visits Baton Rouge to see John and perhaps stay in the city. When he arrives at their home, he meets Ann, who learns that John has invited Graham to stay with them until he finds an apartment. When John arrives home, Graham's demeanor becomes remarkably more guarded; though he realizes he now has nothing in common with John, he and Ann get along well. John is having an affair with Ann's sister Cynthia, a free-spirited artist and bartender, which he rationalizes by blaming Ann's frigidity. Ann helps Graham look for an apartment. Once he has a place, she makes an impromptu visit and notices stacks of camcorder videotapes, labeled with women's names. When asked, Graham explains that they contain interviews with women about their deepest sexual desires and fantasies. Uncomfortable, Ann abruptly leaves. The next day, Cynthia appears uninvited at Graham's apartment and presses Graham to explain what \"spooked\" Ann. He reluctantly explains it was the videotapes that disturbed her and that he achieves gratification by watching the videos in private. Graham propositions Cynthia to make an interview tape, assuring her that only he will see it. She agrees, and later tells Ann about the experience. She is horrified, as is John, when Cynthia later tells him. Cleaning her home the next day, Ann discovers Cynthia's pearl earring in her bedroom while vacuuming and deduces her affair with John. Furious, Ann goes to Graham's apartment with the intention of making a videotape. He objects, but she is insistent. Later, Ann demands a divorce from John and reveals that she made a tape with Graham. He rushes to Graham's apartment and, after attacking Graham and locking him out, watches Ann's tape. In the video, Ann says she has never felt any kind of \"satisfaction\" from sex. Graham asks if she ever thinks of having sex with other men; she admits she has thought of Graham. Ann turns the camera on Graham, who resists opening up but soon confesses that he is haunted by his ex-girlfriend Elizabeth and that his motivation in returning to Baton Rouge was an attempt to achieve some closure. He explains that he was a pathological liar, which destroyed his relationship with her. Graham has since gone to great lengths to avoid people and relationships. Ann kisses him, then he turns off the camcorder, ending the tape. A chastened John joins Graham on the front porch and, with obvious pleasure, confesses to having sex with Elizabeth while she and Graham were a couple, saying: \"She was no saint. She was good in bed, and she could keep a secret. That's all I can say about her.\" After he leaves, Graham angrily destroys his camcorder and all of the videotapes. Some time later, John is urgently summoned to his boss's office. Ann and Cynthia reconcile at the bar Cynthia tends. Later, Ann goes to Graham's and joins him on the front porch. She predicts rain, to which he replies: \"It is raining.\"",

    "Synopsis": "The film centers on young right-wing Leutnant (lieutenant) Theodor Lohse (Ulrich Mühe) who suffers personal and national humiliation during the downfall of the German Empire and the subsequent German Revolution of 1918 as the aftermath of World War I. From then on he pledges revenge on all those he blames for the new times: Democrats, socialists, and Jews. Thus, he becomes increasingly active in the right-wing underground of the early Weimar Republic, joining an organization called \"S II\" (probably based on real-life Organisation Consul that was responsible for a number of political and anti-Semitic assassinations) where his immediate superior is Baron von Rastchuk (Armin Mueller-Stahl). Baron von Rastchuk brings Lohse in contact with Prince Heinrich in order to get Lohse employed, a favor for which the homosexual Prince demands one-time bodily obligingness from Lohse. In spite of his apparent shock and disgust, Lohse yields to the Prince out of his opportunism and willingness to please his superiors. Lohse becomes a full-time spy for the organization, and with unprecedented, relentless opportunism and unscrupulousness he spies in on Communist plots, partakes in the organization's plans to undermine the new German democracy, and disposes of his own right-wing colleagues when he sees fit, all of which to serve his own plans of rising to the top within right-wing circles. During these activities he comes in contact with Benjamin Lenz (Klaus Maria Brandauer), a Jewish man dealing in information on all kinds of criminal and underground political proceedings who will always sell at the highest price, be it paid by left or right-wing conspirators or the police. In spite of Lohse's hatred of Jews, he finds Lenz's services useful, but soon finds himself at his mercy as Lenz through their collaboration finds out more and more about Lohse's schemes and spy activities. When Lenz learns that Lohse ordered a pogrom of the local Jewish ghetto, he confronts the rather short and slim-built Lohse in private, beating him close to senselessness and almost forces Lohse to commit suicide by jumping out of a window, until he realizes that killing Lohse would not make him any better than the anti-Semite that had ordered the violence in the ghetto. Lohse then has his henchmen murder Lenz, also because he knew too much, by pushing him in front of an approaching train. The film ends in late 1923 with Lohse leaving a festivity of conservatives and monarchists, declaring that restoring the monarchy has by now become \"old hat\", and with glowing eyes he mentions a \"new man\" preparing a putsch in Munich to count on - a man named Adolf Hitler.",

    "Synopsis": "The story focuses on a dysfunctional Australian family that includes two daughters: Dawn (nicknamed \"Sweetie\"), a lively, but erratic, and often delusional woman who fancies herself an actor, and her uptight, sullen, and superstitious sister Kay, a factory worker who has a boyfriend named Louis. Their parents, Flo and Gordon, are having serious marital problems. Kay loves Louis because the words of a fortune teller portended she would end up with him. However, the couple's relationship begins to show signs of strain, with Kay uprooting and hiding a tree Louis attempts to plant in their yard because she feels a deep foreboding about it. After an absence, Sweetie returns home with her druggie lover and \"producer\" Bob; she then proceeds to intimidate, control, and abuse the other members of her family. Gordon chooses to ignore Sweetie's mental illness and erratic, childish behavior because he loves her and thinks of her as a child. Throughout the film, there are flashbacks to Sweetie dancing, singing and performing small, circus-like tricks with Gordon's assistance. Flo admits he indulges her. Sweetie's emotional volatility and physical destructiveness (ruining Kay's clothes, breaking furniture) reflects the disruption she has caused her family. Louis breaks up with Kay after mounting tension between the couple. After a series of circular fights (Sweetie rages, her family forgives her, her sweetness and fun persona return), Sweetie completely loses her mind. She strips off her clothes, paints her body black and holes up in her childhood tree house. Though her family begs her to come down, she refuses and keeps shaking the fort until it falls from the tree, killing her and injuring Flo. Trees continue to play a role even after Sweetie's death, as her private interment is briefly disrupted by a tree root that obstructs her grave. Louis and Kay get back together, while Kay's family achieves a sort of resolution. They no longer feel manipulated and agitated by Sweetie's presence. However, the best of her personality persists, as Kay and her parents maintain an image of her in her truest form, that of a little girl.",

    "Synopsis": "Perhan lives with his devoted grandmother Khatidža, his lame sister Danira and his dissolute uncle Merdžan. Khatidža possesses a level of supernatural powers (mainly healing) and Perhan himself has inherited some minor telekinetic abilities. He wants to marry a girl named Azra, but her mother will not allow it, as Perhan is the illegitimate son of a Slovenian soldier who had an affair with Perhan's late mother, and without a job or savings. Ahmed, the \"Gypsy sheikh\", comes to the village with his brothers. Merdžan loses his clothes playing cards with Ahmed's brothers, and comes home desperate for money so that he can repay. It is raining and not finding any money, he accuses the grandmother of hiding the money from him and lifts the frame of the house up (using a rope and a truck), so that it is suspended in mid-air as the rain comes down on Perhan, his grandmother and Danira. Very soon after, Khatidža is summoned to use her powers to save Ahmed's sick son, Roberto, which Khatidža does. For repayment, she proposes a deal with Ahmed - to pay for Danira's leg to be healed at a hospital in Ljubljana. Perhan goes with Danira, promising his grandmother not to leave her, but Ahmed asks where will he stay and convinces him to go to Milan. At first Perhan wants to make money honestly, but after being beaten, tortured and dragged through the mud, Perhan begins stealing and squirreling money away in a shack. After being double-crossed by his brother Sadam, Ahmed appoints Perhan boss of the operation. Now relatively rich, Perhan goes home, where he is enraged to find Azra is pregnant. Perhan refuses to believe that the baby is his. They marry with the condition that she would sell the baby. Perhan is also disappointed to find that the house Ahmed promised to build him is not being built at all, and that Danira was not operated on, but forced to be a beggar as part of Ahmed's money operation. On their wedding night, Azra tells him the child is theirs, and was conceived when they made love on the Feast of St George. Still wearing her wedding dress, Azra dies after giving birth to a boy while levitating mid-air (a sign that the boy, as he inherited the powers, is indeed Perhan's). Because Ahmed leaves with the baby, which we discover later is also named Perhan, he is raised by Ahmed's crew. After four years of searching, Perhan reunites with Danira in Rome, who leads him to Perhan Jr., whom Perhan now accepts as his child. Perhan drops the children off at the train station, promising to meet up with them after buying an accordion for his son and a present (sponges) for grandmother. The boy tells him he is mad at him because he will not return, and he will not get an accordion. Perhan assures him he will, \"Cross my gypsy heart,\" but immediately runs out of the station to settle the score with Ahmed, who is about to be married. Perhan arrives at the wedding and kills Ahmed with a fork, using his telekinetic powers. He also kills one of Ahmed's brothers, but he is in turn killed by Ahmed's new wife. At the funeral, the grandmother passes out drinks to everyone and Perhan Jr. goes outside the house, peers through the window at his dead father, breaks the glass and steals the golden coins put on his father's eyes. Merdžan notices, and follows him out in the rain, as the child runs away hidden under a cardboard box. Merdžan is about to catch him up and pick up the board, but seems to have second thoughts, stops, and starts running toward the nearby church.",

    "Synopsis": "In the early 1950s, Lily Kawamura tells her pre-adolescent daughter Mini about her father and the life that she barely remembers, as the two of them are walking to a rural train station. In 1936, Jack McGurn is a motion picture projectionist, involved in a campaign of harassment against non-union theaters in New York City. One such attack turns fatal, as one of his fellow union members starts a fire. McGurn's boss, knowing that the feelings of guilt would likely cause Jack to go to the police, urges him to leave the city. Jack moves to Los Angeles where his brother Gerry lives. Jack's role as a \"sweatshop lawyer\" strains an already-rocky relationship with Gerry who is willing to have any job, barely keeping his family afloat during the Great Depression. Taking the name McGann, Jack finds a job as a non-union projectionist in a movie theater run by a Japanese American family by the name of Kawamura. He falls in love with Lily, his boss' daughter. Forbidden to see one another by her Issei parents and banned from marrying by California law, the couple elopes to Seattle, where they marry and have a daughter, Mini. When World War II breaks out, Lily and their daughter are caught up in the Japanese American internment, rounded up and sent to Manzanar, California. Jack, away on a trip, is drafted into the United States Army with no chance to help his family prepare for their imprisonment. Finally visiting the camp, he arranges a private meeting with his wife's father, telling him that he has gone AWOL and wants to stay with them, whatever they have to go through. They are his family now and he belongs with them. The older man counsels him to return to the Army, and says that he now believes that Jack is truly in love with Lily, and a worthy husband. Returning, ready to face his punishment for desertion, he is met by FBI agents, who have identified \"McGann\" as being the McGurn wanted for his part in the arson of years before. Finally, in the 1950s, the train arrives and Lily and Mini reunite with Jack, who has served his time in prison and is now returning to his family.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1640, the Gascon poet and swashbuckler Cyrano de Bergerac is self-conscious about his enormous nose, but pretends to be proud of it. He is admired and respected by many people for his bravery and good swordsmanship. He madly loves his cousin, the beautiful Roxane; however, he is sure that she will reject him because of his appearance. To elevate himself in her eyes, he interferes with a play being staged at the Hôtel du Bourgogne, in Paris, and wins a duel with a marquis. In the second act of the play and film, Cyrano meets with Roxane at her request. He is crushed when Roxane tells him she is infatuated with Christian de Neuvillette, a handsome and dashing new recruit to the Cadets de Gascogne (the military unit in which Cyrano is serving). However, Cyrano learns that Christian is tongue-tied when speaking with women. Seeing an opportunity to vicariously declare his love to Roxane, Cyrano approaches Christian with a proposal: Cyrano will write the love letters, and Christian will woo Roxane with them. Christian agrees. Cyrano aids Christian, writing heartfelt love letters and poems. Roxane begins to appreciate Christian, not only for his good looks but also his apparent eloquence. She eventually falls in love with him. But the Comte de Guiche, an arrogant and exceptionally powerful older nobleman, also has designs on Roxane. Roxane and Cyrano thwart De Guiche's attempt to visit Roxane by arranging a quick secret marriage between Roxane and Christian. In revenge, De Guiche orders his company of cadets—including Cyrano and Christian—to report immediately for military duty in the Siege of Arras against the Spanish. The siege is harsh and brutal: the Cadets de Gascogne are starving. Christian does not know that Cyrano escapes over enemy lines twice each day to deliver a love letter written by Cyrano himself but signed with Christian's name, sent to Roxane. These letters draw Roxane out from the city of Paris to the war front to bring food to the troops. Although she has come to visit Christian, she admits to him that she has fallen in love with the author's soul, and would love the author even if he were ugly. Christian tries to find out whether Roxane loves him or Cyrano, and asks Cyrano to find out. However, during the subsequent battle, Christian is mortally wounded. The scene ends with the French returning to the battle. In the final scene of the play and film, in 1654, Roxane has entered a convent and retired from the world. Cyrano has made many enemies with his writings; he is still free, but now poor. During this time, Cyrano has faithfully visited Roxane every week, never declaring his love. On this day, his enemies attack and mortally injure him. Cyrano nevertheless visits Roxane at the convent. When she mentions Christian's last letter, sensing his own mortality, Cyrano asks if he can read it. Roxane gives him the letter, which he reads movingly. Just before Cyrano dies, Roxane realizes that she has loved him all along.",

She stays with her mother Miche in their home on the south coast and helps her when he comes back to convalesce. In moments of conversation or reverie, the three examine their relationships with each other. Miche is a woman of limited and conventional mind, whose only outside interests are bridge and her Catholic church. Her assets were beauty, now gone, and fidelity.

In Tony's last weeks, Caroline begins to learn a lot about the father she hardly ever saw and to form a bond with him, strengthened by secret outings to bars for the alcohol he is forbidden.

    "Synopsis": "Matteo Scuro, a retired Sicilian bureaucrat and opera buff, has been stood up by his five adult children during the summer vacation, all of whom live in various cities on the Italian mainland with what he believes are responsible jobs. Despite their not visiting and the neighbours' criticisms, he remains optimistic, considering that his children could not come because they are too busy. His children are named after popular opera characters, Tosca for Puccini's Tosca, Canio for Leoncavallo's Pagliacci, Norma for Bellini's Norma, Guglielmo for Rossini's Guglielmo Tell and Alvaro for Verdi's La forza del destino. He decides to surprise each of them with a visit, traveling by train, and finds none of them as he imagined, with each of his children seeming to reflect the opera character after whom they were named. Matteo's train journeys take him to Naples, Rome, Florence, Milan and Turin to search for each of his children; he even spends one night on the streets among the homeless. Before his arrival at each of their homes, each of his grown children scramble to put on a façade to cover up their personal failings: One daughter's ex-husband temporarily moves back in with her and their child. A son who lost his University professorship temporarily moves back into his old office. Another daughter hides the fact that she works as a lingerie model, etc. Finally, after visiting all his children, Scuro returns to Sicily, visits his wife's grave, and reports to her with irony that their children are all fine.",

It ends with one from a former British intelligence agent, stating, \"There are two laws running this country: one for the security forces and the other for the rest of us.\" In Northern Ireland, an Orange march is held on The Twelfth, and an audio tape is handed to Paul Sullivan (Dourif), an American human rights lawyer and activist. When Sullivan arranges to meet the person who made the tape, he is assassinated by a death squad. The gunmen retrieve the tape from Sullivan's body. It subsequently becomes clear that the killers are from the British security services. British police investigator Peter Kerrigan (Cox), with the help of Sullivan's assistant, Ingrid Jessner (McDormand), investigates the death. The investigation leads them to Captain Harris, an ex-army intelligence officer now in hiding, who created the tape. He reveals it was a recording of senior military leaders and Conservative Party politicians discussing how they subverted democracy to facilitate Margaret Thatcher's rise to power. Harris gives a copy of the tape to Jessner, after which British security forces kill Harris and blame his death on the IRA. Kerrigan is blackmailed into silence. Jessner has the tape, but without Harris to authenticate it, the recording is dismissed as a forgery.",

    "Synopsis": "Set in 1951, the film centres around Tonia, a cabaret singer in Stalinist Poland. One evening after she performs for soldiers, she quarrels with her husband who she feels has been too friendly with her best friend. Frustrated, she accepts an invitation from two strangers to go out for a drink. The two men then proceed to intentionally get her drunk. They say they will take her home by car, but instead, she is driven to a political military prison to be arrested, imprisoned and interrogated, without being told why. Over the course of several years, she is humiliated and bullied by prison officials with the intention of forcing her to sign false confessions. After refusing to sign a false confession which denounces a friend, she is taken to the shower block in the basement and placed in a tiny barred cell. The water is turned on and the room slowly floods. She is released at the last moment and told to sign the confession form again, but again refuses. Another episode sees her interrogators stage a scene where a man is supposedly executed for refusing to confess. They then confront Tonia and threaten to shoot her as well is she continues to refuse. She doesn't relent, and appears to accept death. In the commotion that follows, she realises that the man was still alive. He was an actor, and her interrogator's charade is revealed. After continually demanding to see her husband, he is finally allowed to visit. Before seeing Tonia, he is told by the officials of the infidelities she had been forced to reveal. In their brief encounter he confronts Tonia about these infidelities and demands an explanation from her. When she remains silent, he renounces her and tells her that he does not want to see her again. Immediately following this, she unsuccessfully attempts suicide. While recovering in the prison's hospital, one of her interrogators takes an interest in her recovery. She repeatedly tells him of the absurdity of the system in which he believes and he seems sympathetic to her situation. The two form a brief romantic relationship, and after a single sexual encounter, she becomes pregnant by him. Like other female inmates, she is forced to give up her child for adoption soon after she gives birth. Later, the father of the child meets with Tonia to inform her that he has secured her release. He also gives her instructions on how to reclaim their child. He then commits suicide. After being released, Tonia visits the orphanage where her daughter had been living. The girl, now a toddler, does not recognise her mother. Tonia and her daughter leave the orphanage together and make their way towards her husband's home. Her daughter appears to recognise the place and rushes ahead, calling out \"father\". This suggests that her husband had been raising the child in her stead.",

    "Synopsis": "Ju Dou is set in the early 20th century in rural China. Yang Tianqing (Li Baotian) returns from a journey to sell silk for his adoptive uncle, Yang Jinshan (Li Wei). Jinshan, a fabric dyer, is notorious for his cruelty. Upon Tianqing's return, another worker is fired by Jinshan. This worker informs Tianqing that Jinshan has recently acquired a new wife, having previously beaten his two wives to death when they failed to bear him a son. Ironically, Jinshan is impotent. When Tianqing meets the new wife, Ju Dou (Gong Li), he becomes infatuated with her. At night, Jinshan subjects Ju Dou to torture. Tianqing discovers Ju Dou's bathing area and secretly observes her. Unbeknownst to him, Ju Dou is aware of his presence. Initially, Tianqing voyeuristically watches, but Ju Dou transforms his gaze by revealing her bruises and weeping, compelling him to see her as a human being rather than just a sexual object. Eventually, their passion becomes uncontrollable, and Tianqing and Ju Dou engage in a sexual relationship. When Ju Dou discovers she is pregnant with Tianqing's child, she and Tianqing deceive Jinshan by pretending the child is his. Jinshan suffers a stroke that leaves him paralyzed from the waist down. After Ju Dou confesses the truth to him, Jinshan attempts to kill the child and set the house on fire. Tianqing restrains Jinshan by suspending him in a barrel, rendering him a powerless witness to their usurpation. Aware that society would never accept her infidelity, Ju Dou seeks an abortion at a nunnery. Jinshan continues to exert influence over the child, Tianbai, whom he named, and when the child addresses Jinshan as \"Father,\" Jinshan interprets it as psychological revenge against his wife and nephew. One day, despite his doting on Tianbai, Jinshan falls into a dye vat and drowns as Tianbei looks on and laughs. Seven years later, Ju Dou and Tianqing still operate the dye mill, but Tianbai (Zheng Ji'an) has become an angry teenager. Rumors of his parents' infidelity drive him to nearly kill a local gossipmonger. In a fit of rage, Ju Dou reveals the truth about his parentage to Tianbai. Overwhelmed, she and Tianqing decide to have one final encounter but succumb to exhaustion and fall asleep in a cellar with limited air supply. Upon discovering his parents in a weakened state in the cellar, Tianbai drags them out and drowns Tianqing. Ju Dou, in turn, sets fire to the mill as the film concludes.",

    "Synopsis": "La Contessa Elena Torlato-Favrini (her last name taken from The Barefoot Contessa) is a wealthy Italian industrialist living in a sprawling estate near Lake Geneva, Switzerland. She is attended by Jules the Gardener, his wife Yvonne, their daughter Cécile, the chauffeur Laurent, and the mysterious Della La Rue (or Della Street), a reference to Erle Stanley Gardner's Perry Mason stories). At the film's opening, Elena goes for a drive by herself and encounters Roger Lennox (his last name taken from The Long Goodbye), an apparent drifter. Elena's trajectory is brought to an abrupt halt as she stops to help Roger, who has evidently been forced off the road by a truck and is severely incapacitated. Roger offers Elena his hand, and Elena accepts his offer (the \"miracle of empty hands\" borrowed from Diary of a Country Priest). The series of exchanges constituting their relationship begins. The narrative continues with Roger now Elena's kept man. He dotes on her and is obedient to her retinue that includes Elena's lawyer Raoul Dorfman, Raoul's girlfriend, the Doctor (one of Elena's shareholders) and the Doctor's wife Dorothy Parker, a writer like her namesake. After a series of episodes in which both members of the couple express dissatisfaction with the other and together ruminate on regret, Elena decides to take a motorboat across the lake to visit some friends. Roger obediently drives the boat and stops when Elena wants to get in the water, but refuses to join her, citing his inability to swim. In a mishap evocative of their first meeting, Roger falls into the water as Elena gets back into the boat. Elena watches him drown and does not help, appearing indifferent to his plight. The servants and Raoul quickly attempt to cover up any existence of Roger but almost immediately there is a new crisis: a man identical to Roger, calling himself Richard Lennox and claiming to be Roger's brother, appears. He claims to know about the boating incident and is apparently using that as leverage to take over one of Elena's companies. While before the figure of Lennox was passive and docile, he is now shrewd and aggressive; it is Elena that now becomes pliant. The power struggle reaches a climax in a recapitulation of the boating scene. Now it is Lennox who decides to take the boat out (this time a rowboat) and it is Elena who falls into the water, apparently unable to swim. Richard, at first as indifferent to Elena as she was to Roger Lennox in the same situation, abruptly takes Elena's hand and saves her. In the end, an equilibrium is reached. Elena realizes that Richard Lennox is the same man as Roger Lennox (\"the same, but different\"). Richard has taken on a controlling role in Elena's affairs, but Elena remains in charge. With renewed vigor, Elena warmly bids arrivederci to her servants (Richard having earlier arranged to sell the estate for a large sum of money) and Elena and Richard in turn drive away, apparently off to have more adventures as equals.",

    "Synopsis": "In late 1980s Moscow, a blues saxophonist named Alexey Seliverstov and his friends spend a wild night in a taxi, only for Alexey to dodge the fare come morning. The taxi driver, Ivan Shlykov, a hardened, no-nonsense man of Soviet principles, tracks Alexey down, takes his saxophone as collateral, and leaves him jobless and homeless. Feeling remorseful, Ivan returns the instrument, leading Alexey to stay in Ivan's shared apartment. The unlikely pair, an idealistic musician and a staunch Soviet everyman, develop an unusual friendship. While Alexey muses philosophically and struggles with alcohol, Ivan considers artists and intellectuals the root of Russia’s problems. This tension escalates when Alexey floods their building, prompting Ivan to seize his passport and force him to work off the repair costs. Yet, Ivan also tries to reform Alexey’s character, challenging his drinking and urging him to embrace discipline. As Alexey’s alcoholism worsens, he attempts suicide, and his friendship with Ivan is further strained. However, a chance meeting with famed American saxophonist Hal Singer boosts Alexey’s spirits, and he seizes an opportunity to perform abroad. Skeptical, Ivan later spots Alexey’s concert on TV, amazed by his success. Alexey eventually returns to Moscow as a celebrated musician, but their reunion turns sour when his friends mock Ivan, leaving him humiliated. In a reckless pursuit, Ivan crashes his taxi while chasing what he thinks is Alexey’s car, only to find himself carrying an injured stranger after both cars explode. The film’s closing sequence reveals their fates: Alexey, now a successful musician in New York, released another album, while Ivan bought his own taxi and settled into a quieter life, reflecting the complexities of their friendship and divergent paths.",

    "film_title": "White Hunter Black Heart",
    "Synopsis": "In the early 1950s, Pete Verrill is invited by his friend, director John Wilson, to rewrite the script for Wilson's latest project: a film with the working title of The African Trader. The hard living, irreverent Wilson convinces producer Paul Landers to have the film completely shot on location in Africa, even though doing so would be extremely expensive. Wilson explains to Verrill that his motivation for this has nothing to do with the film - Wilson, a lifelong hunter, wants to fulfill his dream of going on an African safari; he even purchases a set of finely crafted hunting rifles and charges them to the studio. Upon landing in Entebbe, Wilson and Verrill spend several days at a luxury hotel while Verrill finishes the script and Wilson makes arrangements for the safari. Verrill finds himself growing fond of Wilson after the latter defends him against a fellow guest who makes antisemitic remarks in front of Verrill (who happens to be Jewish) and challenges the hotel manager to a fistfight after witnessing him insult and belittle a black waiter for spilling a drink, which Wilson loses. The two men constantly argue over Verrill's changes to the script, particularly his insistence that Wilson does not use his original planned ending, where all of the main characters are killed on-screen. Wilson hires a pilot to fly him and Verrill out to the hunting camp of safari guide Zibelinsky and his African tracker Kivu, whom Wilson is quick to bond with. The film's unit director, Ralph Lockhart, is also present and insists that Wilson start pre-production before the cast arrives, to which Wilson replies he'll do so after he shoots a \"tusker\". Verrill gradually becomes disenchanted with Wilson, who keeps going out to hunt despite his poor health and seems completely indifferent to the success of his movie. He even questions why Wilson would want to kill such a magnificent beast. Confronted, Wilson tells Verrill off and accuses him of \"playing it safe\" and not wanting to risk anything. He calls hunting a \"sin that you can get a license for\" and doesn't try to convince Verrill otherwise when he threatens to resign and go back to London. Landers arrives in Entebbe and insists that Verrill stay on, revealing that the studio is at risk of bankruptcy if the movie isn't finished. When Verrill does return, he is informed by Lockhart that Wilson, without consulting anyone, has decided to move the entire production to Kivu's home village despite Landers spending most of the budget on a prefabricated set. The cast, now unable to stay at the hotel, go to Zibelinsky's camp and find Wilson waiting for them with a lavish banquet. He humiliates Landers and takes advantage of several days of rain to resume his safari, now accompanied by professional elephant hunter Ogilvy. Verrill follows after Wilson again taunts him for cowardice. Wilson finally gets his chance to kill the \"tusker\", but when the time comes to shoot, he suddenly finds he can't pull the trigger. The elephant suddenly charges after seeing its child move too close to Wilson, and Kivu tries to scare it off only to be fatally gored by the elephant's tusks. Wilson, horrified by Kivu's death, returns to the set. He sees the villagers beating drums and asks Ogilvy what they mean. Ogilvy replies that they are communicating to everyone how Kivu died: \"white hunter, black heart\". Recognizing that he is ultimately to blame for what happened, Wilson tells Verrill that he was right: the film does need a happy ending after all. Sitting in his director's chair as the actors and crew take their places to film the opening scene of The African Trader, a now humbled Wilson silently mutters \"Action\".",

    "Synopsis": "In Cape Fear, North Carolina, lovers Lula Fortune and Sailor Ripley are separated after he is jailed for killing a man who attacked him with a knife; the assailant, Bobby Ray Lemon, was hired by Lula's mother, Marietta. Upon Sailor's release 22 months later, Lula picks him up outside prison, where she hands him his snakeskin jacket. They have sex in a hotel room and go to see speed metal band Powermad. At the club, Sailor beats up a man for flirting with Lula, and then leads the band in a rendition of the Elvis Presley song \"Love Me\". When Lula asks why Sailor didn't sing her his favorite song, \"Love Me Tender\", he tells her he will only ever sing it to his future wife. Sailor asks Lula to run away to California with him, despite knowing this will break his parole. Marietta asks her on-off boyfriend, private detective Johnnie Farragut, to find them and bring them back. Unbeknownst to Farragut, Marietta also hires her other boyfriend, gangster Marcello Santos, to track them and kill Sailor. When Santos calls mob boss Mr. Reindeer to arrange for the job, he adds Farragut to the hit list, sending Marietta into a guilt-fueled rage. Despite her attempts to save Farragut, Mr. Reindeer's assassins capture and kill him. Unaware of these events, Lula and Sailor continue on their way until they encounter the aftermath of a two-car collision. They try to help the only survivor, a traumatized and brain-damaged young woman who eventually dies in front of them. Lula is disturbed, and considers it a bad omen. She is also unsettled by Sailor's revelation that he had been Santos' driver and may have witnessed her father's murder by Santos and Marietta, which places him in the latter's crosshairs. Nearly penniless, Sailor heads for Big Tuna, Texas, where he asks old acquaintance Perdita Durango whether someone is after him. Perdita says she is unaware of any murder contract, but is later revealed to be lying. At an outdoor party, Lula and Sailor meet career criminal Bobby Peru. Lula, who has been feeling ill, tells Sailor she is pregnant. While Sailor is changing their car's oil, Lula waits for him in the motel room. Peru enters the room, deduces Lula's pregnancy and proceeds to intimidate, grope and violently coerce her into asking him for sex; when she finally does, he mockingly reveals his threats to be a bluff and leaves. This traumatizes Lula, who was previously raped as a child. Not knowing about Peru's abuse of Lula, Sailor agrees to accompany him to a bar. Over beers, Peru enlists Sailor's help in robbing a nearby feed store. During the robbery, Peru unnecessarily shoots the two store clerks and admits to Sailor that he has been hired to kill him, and that he handed Sailor a pistol with dummy ammunition. Chasing Sailor out of the store, Peru is repeatedly shot by a sheriff's deputy and accidentally blows his own head off with his shotgun. Sailor is sentenced to six years in prison for his part in the robbery. While Sailor is in jail, Lula has their child. Lula decides to reunite with him upon his release, rejecting her mother's objections over the phone. She throws water over Marietta's photograph and goes to pick up Sailor with their son, Pace. The reunion is awkward and Sailor decides to leave them both, believing they will be better off without his influence. While he is walking a short distance away, Sailor is accosted by members of a street gang, and is quickly knocked out after insulting them. While unconscious, he sees a vision of Glinda the Good Witch, who tells him, \"Don't turn away from love, Sailor.\" When he awakens, Sailor apologizes to the men, tells them he realizes the error of his ways, and runs after Lula. The photograph of Marietta in Lula's house sizzles and vanishes, symbolically mirroring the demise of Wicked Witch of the West. Sailor runs over the roofs and hoods of the cars in a traffic jam to reunite with Lula and Pace. When he catches up with them, he finally sings \"Love Me Tender\" to Lula, effectively proposing to her.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1949, a woman (her name is not revealed, referred to as Anna) returns from a labor camp to Leningrad. A young man, covered in liquid clay and wearing a women's purse on his belt, shoots at her with an imaginary bow. On the train, the heroine keeps a diary and reflects on her uncertain future. She arrives at her apartment, but it is already inhabited by three Uzbek women. One of them (Tatiana Drubich) tries to pull a milk tooth from a child. Anna goes to a communal apartment where her documents were once hidden. There, a child speaks from behind a door, claiming to be alone and unable to open it. Anna is about to leave but is recognized and let in. Inside, there are three people: two men (Pyotr Mamonov, Alexander Feklistov) and a woman (Svetlana Nemolyaeva), who was pretending to be the child. The chest with the documents has been burned. Later, Anna visits a house where a mad grandmother (Maria Kapnist) lives with her grandsons – a boy named Alexander and a girl named Mari (Olga Orlova). She helps pull a tooth from the boy. The apartment is filled with works of art in the avant-garde style. There, Anna learns of her mother's death, Maria Alexandrovna. Mari tells her how to find her mother's grave: \"There lives a Big Black Dog—Kaplan, she will show you the way\" (a black German shepherd named Greta, owned by Nadezhda Borisovna Sager, also the dog's trainer in the film, and a double for the heroine in scenes with the dog in the background). Anna goes to the cemetery. There, a pioneer is being buried... The Big Black Dog Kaplan (Greta) passes by, marking her presence and leading Anna towards the search for her mother's grave. She returns to the city and sees a boy in a rabbit costume. She chases after him and enters a cinema where a black-and-white film is playing, composed of fragments from Khodjamirov's film Unexpected Joys: the actresses Natasha (Natalya Leble) and Lena (Elena Solovey) collect carpets and learn a legend about a main carpet that has magical powers. When they buy it, they realize the legend is no longer true, as the main condition had been broken: no innocent blood had been spilled on the carpet in a hundred years. Persuaded by the filmmaker Prokudin-Gorsky (Emmanuel Vitorgan), the sisters go to the front line, hoping to lay the carpet under one of the innocent victims and revive the belief by spilling her blood. However, Prokudin-Gorsky himself spills his own blood on the carpet, and he is killed with a sabre. Yet, the belief is not revived, and they have been deceived. Later, Anna meets a young man (Viktor Sibilev). He once turned the notes for a singer called \"Divine,\" but now he is impoverished. They go to his home, and while playing Chopin on the piano, Anna offers to help him. Together, they decide to kill and rob a rich retired military officer who, based on Anna's remarks, once wrote a denunciation about her. Anna has poison in a vial (which she took from the labor camp). They go to the Yeliseevsky store and buy Crimean apples. Anna injects the poison into one of the apples. After waiting for the officer's wife (Natalya Fateeva) to leave, Anna takes the poisoned apples to him. He mistakes her for Anna Karamazova (whom he had just spoken to on the phone) and lets her in. After eating the apple, the officer dies. Anna robs him, but his wife unexpectedly returns. They struggle, and Anna escapes. Later, Anna and the young man go to the theater. She still carries the purse. She leaves it in the box, and it starts to swell. Anna goes down into a flooded toilet and gives the old cleaning lady the stolen clothes from the officer. In the young man's house, a passing train causes a portrait of young Vladimir Lenin to fall and break, as it is accompanied by the words \"Sesame, open up!\"",

    "film_title": "Barton Fink",
    "Synopsis": "<!-- Please do NOT add significantly to this plot summary. We're trying to keep it short! (See WP:SS for more info) --> In 1941, up-and-coming Broadway playwright Barton Fink accepts a contract from Capitol Pictures in Hollywood to write film scripts for a thousand dollars per week. Upon moving to Los Angeles, Fink settles into the cheap Hotel Earle. His room's only decoration is a small painting of a woman on the beach, arm raised to block the sun. Fink is assigned to a wrestling film by his new boss Jack Lipnick, but he finds difficulty in writing for the unfamiliar subject. He is distracted by sounds coming from the room next door, and he phones the front desk to alert them of the disturbing sounds. His neighbor, Charlie Meadows, the source of the noise, visits Fink to apologize. During their conversation, Fink proclaims his affection for \"the common man\", and Meadows describes his life as an insurance salesman. thumb|upright|The Coen brothers wrote the role of Charlie Meadows for actor John Goodman, in part because of the \"warm and friendly image that he projects for the viewer\". Still unable to proceed beyond the first lines of his script, Fink consults producer Ben Geisler for advice. Irritated, the frenetic Geisler takes him to lunch and orders him to consult another writer for assistance. Fink meets the novelist W. P. Mayhew by chance in the bathroom. They briefly discuss movie-writing and arrange a second meeting later in the day. Fink later learns from Mayhew's secretary, Audrey Taylor, that Mayhew suffers from alcoholism and that Taylor ghostwrote some of his scripts. With one day left before his meeting with Lipnick to discuss the film, Fink phones Taylor and begs her for assistance. Taylor visits him at the Earle and they have sex. Fink awakens the next morning to find that Taylor has been violently murdered. Horrified, he summons Meadows and asks for help. Meadows is repulsed but disposes of the body and orders Fink to avoid contacting the police. After Fink has a meeting with an unusually supportive Lipnick, Meadows announces to Fink that he is going to New York for several days, and asks him to watch over a package he is leaving behind. Soon afterwards, Fink is visited by two police detectives, who inform him that Meadows's real name is Karl \"Madman\" Mundt. Mundt is a serial killer whose modus operandi is beheading his victims. Stunned, Fink places the box on his desk without opening it and he begins writing feverishly. Fink produces the entire script in one sitting and he goes out for a night of celebratory dancing, returning to find the detectives in his room, who inform him of Mayhew's murder and accuse Fink of complicity with Mundt. As the hotel is suddenly engulfed in flames, Mundt appears and kills the detectives with a shotgun, after which he mentions that he had paid a visit to Fink's parents and uncle in New York. Fink leaves the still-burning hotel, carrying the box and his script. Shortly thereafter he attempts to telephone his family, but there is no answer. In a final meeting with Lipnick, who has been conscripted by the United States Army Reserve to serve as a colonel in the Second World War, Fink's script (which is suggested to be a nearly word-for-word copy of the Broadway play shown in the opening scene) is lambasted as \"a fruity movie about suffering\", and he is informed that he is to remain in Los Angeles; although Fink will remain under contract, Capitol Pictures will not produce anything he writes until he \"grows up a little\". Dazed, Fink wanders onto a beach, still carrying the package. He meets a woman who looks just like the one in the picture on his wall at the Earle, and she asks about the box. He tells her he does not know what it contains nor who owns it. He asks her if she has ever been in pictures, and she says no. She then assumes the pose from the picture on the hotel room wall.",

    "Synopsis": "Bryant Weeks plays American jazz cornetist Bix Beiderbecke in an account of his life. The film focuses on his conflicts with his family and his relations with the prominent jazz musicians of the 1920s, such as Hoagy Carmichael, Joe Venuti, Pee Wee Russell, Don Murray, and Paul Whiteman. Mark Sovel plays his friend and collaborator, saxophonist and bandleader Frankie Trumbauer. The film opens in October 1931 in New York City, two months after the death of Bix Beiderbecke. His brother Burnie arrives in the city to meet Liza, who was to be the future bride of the deceased brother. His investigations of where Bix worked led him to the Italian-American violinist Joe Venuti, the trumpeter's only true friend and therefore unique in knowing the truth and the identity of the girl. Venuti, despite the initial hesitation, decides to help him in the investigation. He contacts the girl and convinces her to follow him to the trumpeter's hometown, Davenport, Iowa, thus fulfilling Bix's mother's desire, who is eager to meet her. During the long train journey, however, it turns out that Liza never met Bix. Venuti will take advantage of it to tell her, in addition to the way in which Bix came into contact with her, the short but intense life of his friend, who he had met by chance while trying to get an engagement in the Jean Goldkette orchestra. A series of flashbacks follow. Bix was hampered by the fact that he could not read music but played by ear. Bix achieved success when he performed and recorded with the orchestra of Frank Trumbauer who, despite his somewhat peculiar character, took him under his protective wing. The film ends with Bix's untimely death in 1931 in New York City. During the closing credits, photos of Bix and Liza are shown in the Beiderbecke family home alongside those of his father and mother.",

    "Synopsis": "Just after the end of World War II, a young American of German descent, Leopold Kessler, comes to the U.S.-occupied zone of Germany and gets a job with his uncle as a sleeping car conductor for the railway company Zentropa. Fresh faced and idealistic, Kessler has come to work in Germany as his \"small contribution to making the world a better place,\" but has difficulty adapting to German customs. Kessler meets a young German woman, Katharina, the daughter of the founder of Zentropa, Max Hartmann. She points out bodies that have been hanged on trees outside the train, and explains that they are members of Werwolf, a Nazi guerilla terrorist organization that continues to sabotage the Allied occupiers. Katharina invites Kessler to dinner at her half-bombed family mansion, where he meets her older brother, Lawrence Hartmann, and her father, Max Hartmann. Also present is U.S. Army Colonel Harris, who gives Max Hartmann a special survey: if it is found that Hartmann colluded in any capacity with the Nazi government, a near certainty given the scope of his operation, his company will be taken away from him. Harris recruits a hesitant Kessler to keep his eyes open for Werwolf activity on the trains. Kessler does not have to wait long before discovering Werwolf activity, as a man claiming to be a friend of the Hartmann family gives Kessler two children to watch during his next train outing. It is then revealed that the Werwolf group recruited one of the boys on a suicide mission to assassinate someone on the train. The day of the survey arrives. Colonel Harris secures false testimony from a Jewish American to claim that Max Hartmann rescued him from the Nazis, in order to rehabilitate the Zentropa founder, but Hartmann later commits suicide out of shame. Leopold and Katharina have sex, and she reveals that she was formerly a Werwolf: after leaving the group, they sent blackmail letters to her father, threatening to reveal her involvement. Kessler stops the train in order to facilitate Max Hartmann's funeral, which is not permitted by the U.S. occupiers. After the funeral, Werwolf agents pull Kessler into a car, and formally ask him to join their side against the Americans, but he is hesitant. Kessler falls in love with Katharina, who asks him to marry her. On their honeymoon, she reveals that Zentropa trains carried human transport during the war, the likely reason for her father's suicide. They settle into married life, and live happily for a time. One day, Katharina is apparently kidnapped by the Werwolf group, who also kill Lawrence Hartmann. The group demands that Kessler use explosives to blow up the train during a bridge crossing. Due to the stress of his wife's kidnapping, and deciding whether or not to bomb the train, Kessler flubs an important professional examination, infuriating his uncle. Kessler plants the explosives, and runs off the train. However, pity for the potential victims inspires him to climb aboard again, and disable the bomb. Colonel Harris and the U.S. forces uncover the Werwolf cell, and Kessler finds Katharina in handcuffs. She was a Werwolf all along, and as well as faking her own kidnapping, she herself sent the extortionate letters to her father. She expresses disgust at Kessler's cowardice in refusing to commit to a side, and says Kessler should have blown up the train, because there are no innocent people in Germany—during the war years, its citizens either killed or betrayed. Driven to despair, Kessler reluctantly decides to detonate the explosives after all. The train crashes into the river and several people are killed, including Kessler's uncle and Katharina. Kessler too is drowned in the sunken train, and floats out to sea.",

    "Synopsis": "David Merrill, a successful director in 1950s Hollywood, returns from film-location scouting abroad to find that a rising tide of McCarthyism and the Red Scare is creating havoc among his colleagues in the film industry. His friend Larry Nolan is forced to name to the FBI and Congressional Oversight Committee the many people in Hollywood who are potentially associated with the communist movement. Nolan names several friends and colleagues such as Merrill as collaborators. Although most of them have tangential relations to the actual United States Communist Party, Washington, D.C., forces Hollywood executives such as mogul Darryl Zanuck to convince his directors and support staff to disavow communism, agree to perjure themselves in congressional hearings, and name other Hollywood influencers as communist agents. Merrill is asked by Hollywood legal consultant Felix Graff to cooperate with FBI agents to cite four names, including screenwriter and childhood friend Bunny Baxter, as communists to Congress. If not, he will not be allowed to work again in the film industry. By refusing, Merrill is blacklisted from Hollywood and quickly loses his assets. Unable to pay alimony to his ex-wife Ruth and son, Merrill tries his luck across the country in New York City. He is initially well received by past colleagues, but is eventually convinced by FBI agents and Merrill's friends on Broadway to abandon him as well. Merrill retreats to Los Angeles and rekindles his friendship with Ruth while he stays in her apartment. She has sold her home and has restarted her teaching career in elementary school. Despite losing all his money, the family dynamic improves with his constant presence in his son's life. Meanwhile, Dorothy Nolan, actress and Larry's estranged wife, has a mental breakdown. Her refusal to cooperate with the FBI has led to her losing custody of her son. When she discovers that Merrill cannot offer her a job on Broadway because of his failed dealings with New York producers, a distraught Dorothy drives her car off a cliff to her death. Things begin to improve when Merrill receives a phone call from a B-movie director to pick up the pieces of his failing Western. After successfully improving the film's direction and artistry, the FBI again tracks down Merrill and has him removed from the film. Bunny Baxter is also in a situation because in his youth, he attended communist rallies but did not mention it to the FBI. That has put him in the position of perjury, and the inquiry board has threatened him with extensive jail time unless he also names Hollywood associates as Communists. Bunny begs Merrill to allow his name to be \"thrown under the bus\" because he is \"already dead\", but Ruth kicks him out of the house in disgust. Merrill decides to contact Zanuck's lawyer Graff again after Zanuck begs him to concede to the Congressional requirements to name conspirators in the Communist party. Speaking to Graff, it is assumed that Merrill is broken and will cooperate with Congress in Washington, D.C., to resurrect his career. At the hearing, under much derision from the committee, Merrill again backtracks and refuses to discuss anyone aside from himself, which causes a fracas in the room. The committee cites him with contempt of Congress, which leads to others being sent to prison for years. As he leaves, Bunny takes his place at the witness stand and also refuses to cooperate with the demand that he name his colleagues as conspirators.",

    "Synopsis": "Bobby Gold is a homicide detective on the trail of Robert Randolph, a drug-dealer and cop-killer on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List. En route to nab an accomplice of Randolph, Gold and his partner Tim Sullivan happen upon a murder scene: the elderly Jewish owner of a candy store in a ghetto has been gunned down, reportedly for a fortune hidden in her basement. The deceased woman's son, a doctor, uses his clout to have Gold assigned to the case in the belief that Gold, himself Jewish, might be empathetic to his plight. Gold, however, seems to disregard his ethnicity and is irritated about being pulled off a much higher-profile case. Ultimately, though, this is offset by interactions with members of the Jewish community that play on Gold's feelings of inadequacy and inability to fit in. A nighttime survey of the crime scene uncovers an important piece of the woman's past, and Gold's reluctance turns to curiosity, leading to the discovery of a Zionist organization operating in the city. The apparent power and sense of pride these people have is appealing to Gold, and he attempts to become a part of their group. Gold is thrust into a series of circumstances that test not only his loyalty to the badge, but also his newfound Jewish consciousness. Gold finds the old woman at one time was running guns for a Jewish liberation group. The group is attempting to protect their people from threats within the community. When asked to steal a list of group member names from police evidence to protect the group, Gold objects and is rejected by the Jewish group leaders for denying his faith. Asking the help of a Jewish woman in the group, Gold is led to a toy shop in the city that is a secret stronghold of Nazi sympathizers, filled with anti-Jewish propaganda - proving the Jewish group's fears of danger and antisemitism were true. Gold erupts in anger, setting off the bomb given to him by the woman, destroying the stronghold/toy shop. He is again approached by the Jewish group to retrieve the list from police evidence. When he refuses, the group shows him photographs of his acts at the toy shop, attempting to blackmail him into assisting. During a raid to apprehend Randolph, where Gold is late to arrive due to the meeting with the Jewish group, Sullivan dies in Gold's arms, killed by gunshot. Gold, filled with rage, says he will \"kill that nigger\" and charges through the building, where he loses his gun. He finds a heavy chain to use as a makeshift weapon and catches up to Randolph, who is attempting to escape through the basement. Randolph shoots him and talks mockingly to him while clearing a metal grate blocking his escape route. Gold informs him that it was Randolph's mother who turned him in, to which Randolph replies by shooting Gold again in the arm. As proof, Gold gives him the phony passport arranged by his mother, when suddenly a police officer off screen shoots Randolph in the chest, killing him. Gold returns to the precinct to apologetic words from some of his fellow police officers, who now seem distant, possibly due to the circumstances of his partner's death. He is told he is \"off homicide\" and learns the old woman was killed by a pair of black kids, attempting to get the “fortune” hidden in her basement.",

    "Synopsis": "Successful Harlem architect Flipper Purify lives with his wife Drew, a buyer at Bloomingdale's, and their young daughter, Ming. One day at his office, the Mast & Covington architecture firm in mid-town Manhattan, Flipper discovers that an Italian-American woman named Angela \"Angie\" Tucci from Bensonhurst has been hired as his temp secretary. Initially upset at being the only black person, he relents when senior partners Jerry and Leslie remind him that hiring is based on ability, not race. Angie's quiet fiancé Paulie Carbone co-manages a corner grocery store/cafe and newsstand and lives with his elderly widowed father Lou. When Paulie arrives to take her out on a date, her brothers Charlie and James antagonize him while he awaits her arrival, threatening physical retribution if he sexually disrespects her. Nevertheless, she urges Paulie to stand up to them as they depart. After working several late nights together, Flipper and Angie have sex, beginning a tumultuous relationship. The next day, Flipper demands that Jerry and Leslie promote him to partner, but they deny his request, and he resigns, telling his employers that his ideas and work have made the firm very profitable. Eventually, he admits his infidelity to his longtime friend, Cyrus, who criticizes him not for his infidelity towards his wife, but for his affair with a white woman. Cyrus describes his situation as \"jungle fever\"—an attraction borne of sexualized racial myths rather than love—and Flipper warns him against telling anyone. Angie's friends are equally disparaging when she discloses her liaison. Drew learns about Flipper's affair through Cyrus's wife Vera and ejects him from their home, forcing him to move in with his father, Southern Baptist preacher the Good Reverend Doctor Purify, and his mother, Lucinda. Later that night, he confronts Cyrus for betraying his trust and insults Vera for snitching, which damages his friendship with Cyrus. Shortly afterwards, Flipper denounces Cyrus, realizing that he will always side with Vera regardless of her actions. Later, Angie devastates Paulie by ending their longstanding engagement, but when she returns, her father Mike, having discovered her relationship with Flipper, severely beats Angie with his belt and kicks her out. Flipper attempts to reconcile with Drew at her workplace by bringing her flowers, but Drew declines, feeling he was only attracted to her for being half-white. He and Angie move into an apartment in Greenwich Village, where they encounter discrimination for being a mixed-race couple, such as insults from a waitress named LaShawn at a local restaurant, chastisement from the Good Reverend during the couple's dinner with his parents, and financial issues. One night, Flipper is restrained and almost arrested by two policemen who receive a wrongful report that he was attacking Angie. The couple's issues are compounded by Flipper's feelings for his family and her wanting to have children of her own, causing their split. Echoing Cyrus's earlier words, Flipper tells Angie their relationship has been based on sexual racial myths and not love. Angie, although upset, accepts that the affair has ultimately run its course. Later, Flipper's crack-addicted brother Gator steals and sells Lucinda's TV for drugs. Searching all over Harlem, Flipper eventually locates him in a crack house and exasperatedly disowns him. Soon afterwards, Gator returns to his parents' house to ask for money and, after Lucinda refuses, begins ransacking the home. His erratic behavior ignites an altercation that ends with the Good Reverend angrily disowning him before shooting him with a handgun. Gator collapses and dies in Lucinda's arms as the Good Reverend watches remorsefully. Meanwhile, Paulie's racist Italian-American friends mock the end of his engagement. Defying his father, Paulie asks one of his customers, a friendly black woman named Orin Goode, out on a date, to her bewilderment. En route to meet Orin, his other customers viciously assault him for attempting an interracial relationship. Although badly beaten, Paulie still arrives for his date with Orin. Mike reluctantly allows Angie to return home, and Flipper, unaware of his own family tragedy, unsuccessfully tries to mend his relationship with Drew. As Flipper leaves from his apartment, a young crack-addicted prostitute propositions him; in response, Flipper embraces her and cries out in anguished torment.",

Frenhofer lives in a grand château in the south of France with his young wife, Liz. The conversations are initially desultory until Porbus suggests that Frenhofer might want to paint the attractive Marianne. Porbus believes she could be what Frenhofer needs to complete his last piece, which was abandoned ten years ago when Liz was his model. Nicolas agrees to the idea, but Marianne becomes angry with him for not asking her first before promising the master that she would model. Nonetheless, she goes to the château the next day. Work starts early the next morning in Frenhofer's isolated studio, consisting of continual pen and wash studies on paper of Marianne in different positions as he tries to capture the uniqueness of her body and the character of the woman within it. Over long days together, their relationship fluctuates, sometimes staying distant and sometimes becoming more relaxed. Frenhofer progresses to working in oils on canvas, and one day, he overpaints an unfinished study of Liz. When Liz sneaks into the studio one night and sees it, she is furious and hurt by the symbolism. As the object of Frenhofer's concentrated attention all day, mostly in silence, Marianne has time to rethink her relationship with Nicolas and decides she no longer needs him. Eventually, Frenhofer finishes his picture, which the film audience never sees. Once complete, the image is too powerful for both Liz and Marianne. Frenhofer hides it in a recess, which he seals with bricks and mortar, and quickly paints an innocuous version in which the face of the model is unseen. Porbus is invited to a celebratory party, after which the changed Marianne breaks up with Nicolas.",

    "Synopsis": "In the vast, desolate mountains of northwest China, an elderly blind musician known as Shenshen has spent sixty years wandering village to village, playing his three-stringed lute and telling stories, sustained by his late master's promise: inside the instrument's body lies a prescription that will restore his sight once he has snapped a thousand strings. He takes on a young blind apprentice named Shitou, passing on the same hope. When they arrive in a remote village plagued by clan feuds, Shitou falls deeply in love with a local girl, Lanxiu, leading to heartbreak and violence that shakes his faith in the distant dream of sight. As Shenshen finally breaks his thousandth string and discovers the \"prescription\" is nothing but a blank sheet of paper—a deliberate lie to give life tension and purpose—he confronts the emptiness yet chooses to perpetuate the illusion by sealing the same blank paper into Shitou's instrument, urging him to snap even more strings. The film ends with the master and apprentice continuing their endless journey across the barren landscape, embodying the bittersweet truth that life's meaning lies not in unreachable destinations, but in the taut, resonant strings of hope that keep one moving forward.",

    "film_title": "The Assassin of the Tsar",
    "Synopsis": "Timofeyev (Malcolm McDowell) is a patient in an asylum during the 1980s who claims to have killed Tsar Alexander II in 1881 and Tsar Nicholas II, Alexander's grandson, in 1918. One day, Doctor Smirnov (Oleg Yankovsky) notices a strange blue stripe around Timofvev's neck. He learns from his superior, Doctor Alexander Yegorovich (Armen Dzhigarkhanyan) that the blue stripe appears once a year and always on the day one of Alexander II's assassins was killed. Yegorovich also tells him that every August, Timofeyev experiences symptoms of an ulcer, just like Yakov Yurovsky, one of the men who killed Nicolas II. During a session with Smirnov, Timofeyev falls into his Yurovsky persona, complaining about his daughter's arrest and his immense stomach pains. Smirnov suggests to Yegorovich that someone should pretend to be the tsar, believing that if Timofeyev sees that the \"tsar\" is still alive, it might break the delusion. Yegorovich vetos the idea, but Smirnov decides to go through with it. During another session, when Timofevev, as Yurovsky, narrates his reaction to the death of Alexander II, Smirnov pretends he is Nicholas II. That night, a scar appears on Smirnov's head, bleeding despite the lack of an open wound, then disappears. When Smirnov describes the experience to Yegorovich, Yegorovich points out that Nicholas II had also suffered a minor wound to head and tries to persuade Smirnov to cease his investigation, saying there are some things humanity simply can never understand. In a later session, Timofeyev asks the \"tsar\" about his life. An extended scene shows the Russian Imperial Family's first day of house arrest at the Ipatiev House in Yekaterinburg, with Yurovsky played by McDowell and Nicholas II by Yankovsky. Yegorovich runs into Smirnov while getting eggs and again asks him to leave Timofeyev alone, but he insists he must learn why Yurovsky killed him. Timofeyev and Smirnov relive the day the Romanovs were executed, each man asking the other questions about what happened and why. During breakfast, Yurovsky gives the family eggs sent by a convent. Leonid Sednev is sent away during dinner; Timofeyev does not recall where. At night, Yurovsky rouses the Romanovs from their slumber and asks them to go the basement, claiming the house may soon be attacked. They gloomily follow him to a bare room. After readying his executioners and gathering the Romanovs in a line, Yurovsky, with some hesitation, reads their death sentence to them. He and his men quickly execute the Romanovs, with Yurovsky personally finishing off Alexei. Timofeyev narrates how his group disposed of the bodies. First, they stripped the corpses naked, then threw them into a mine. The next day, seeing the mine was not deep enough, they pulled the bodies up and tried to put them in another mine, only to get stuck. Frustrated, they dug a common grave, splashed the bodies with acid, smashed them with the butts of their rifles, and drove across them. Smirnov dies. The film ends with Timofeyev still in the asylum, calmly making goods in the workshop.",

    "film_title": "The Double Life of Veronique",
    "Synopsis": "In 1968, a Polish girl looks at the winter stars, while in France, another girl sees the first leaf of spring. In 1990, Weronika, a young Polish woman, sings in an outdoor concert with her choir when a rainstorm interrupts the performance. That night, she has sex with her boyfriend, Antek, and leaves the next day for Kraków to visit her sick aunt. She tells her father that she has a strange feeling of not being alone. In Kraków, Weronika joins a local choir and auditions for a solo part. She is selected, and the opportunity makes her happy. While walking through the Main Square, she notices a French tourist who looks identical to her, taking photographs before boarding a bus. During the concert where she is to sing the solo, Weronika collapses onstage and dies from cardiac arrest. That same day in Clermont-Ferrand, France, Véronique feels sudden sadness after having sex with her boyfriend. She later tells her music teacher that she is quitting the choir. At school, she attends a marionette performance with her students and leads them in a musical piece by the 18th-century composer Van den Budenmayer—the same music Weronika sang before her death. That night, Véronique sees a puppeteer at a traffic light signaling to her not to light the wrong end of her cigarette. Later, she receives a phone call with no voice, only choir music. She visits her father the next day and tells him that she feels she has lost someone, though she does not know who. Soon, Véronique receives a package containing a shoelace. She later identifies the puppeteer as Alexandre Fabbri, a children's book author. She reads several of his books before receiving another package from her father, which contains a cassette tape. The tape includes various sounds: a typewriter, a train station, footsteps, and a fragment of Van den Budenmayer's music. The envelope's postage stamp leads her to Gare Saint-Lazare in Paris. At a café in the station, Véronique finds Alexandre, who tells her that he sent the packages as an experiment to see if she would come. She is upset and leaves to check into a nearby hotel. Alexandre follows her and apologizes. They later have sex. The next morning, Véronique tells Alexandre that she has always felt like she was in two places at once and that something has been influencing her life. She shows him photos from her recent trip to Poland. Alexandre notices one that looks like her, but she tells him it is not. When she sees the image, she realizes it is Weronika. She becomes emotional, and Alexandre comforts her. She understands that Weronika's death has influenced her decision to stop singing. Later, Véronique visits Alexandre and sees him working on two marionettes that resemble her. He explains that he needs a second puppet as a backup in case one is damaged. He demonstrates how to operate the marionette while the duplicate remains on the table. Alexandre reads from his new book, which is about two women born on the same day in different places who share a mysterious connection. Later, Véronique goes to her father's house. She stops at the gate and touches an old tree trunk. Inside the house, her father seems to sense her presence.",

Paolo often recalls his mother and his First Communion, with which he seems to live a totalizing experience in the divine. In his friend Nicola's nightclub, Paolo meets the young Francesca, back from a relationship with an Indian guru, who has just had an abortion and is alone. Intimacy develops between the two: according to Paolo, this is the victory of the ultra sex and of the fusion that completes and exalts everything, a fusion that Francesca assures him thanks to a special oriental technique, which allows the partner a state of permanent efficiency. They shut themselves up in his beach house south of Rome where, after filling the fridge, they spend their time eating and making love, interrupted only by a quick incursion of Paolo's children visiting him and a small group of friends. But Francesca at a given moment thinks of leaving for other shores, while Paolo understands that in order to \"communicate\" there is really only one alternative: either to love each other totally, or to tear apart that voluptuous female body, put it in the fridge and eat it by the sea in front of the sun. Thus, after having made animalistic love in the kennel of the beloved dog Giovanni, Paolo's insane anxiety is satisfied: he kills Francesca, cuts her up and keeps her in the refrigerator, eating her piece by piece.",

    "Synopsis": "Hardened New York City homicide detective Emily Eden, daughter of a divorced former cop, and her partner Nick attempt to arrest two drug dealers. However, Nick is stabbed by one of the dealers, whom Emily shoots, killing him as he tries to flee. As a result, her superior Lt. Oliver temporarily takes away her gun. After Nick is hospitalized and the dealers have been apprehended, Emily goes undercover to investigate the murder of a Hasidic diamond-cutter named Yaakov Klausman. She questions the family of the Hasidic rebbe, an elderly Holocaust survivor who is revered for his wisdom and compassion toward his fellow Jews. He says to her, \"You and I have something in common: We are both intimately familiar with evil. It does something to your soul.\" While living with the rebbe's family, Emily changes her appearance and takes a liking to his son, Ariel, a young man who works as a diamond-cutter but teaches in the yeshiva and is expected to follow his father as the next rebbe. In addition to keeping all 613 Mitzvot, he is waiting for his intended, or basherte, the daughter of a Paris rebbe whom he has not yet actually met. They are the subjects of an arranged marriage, but he believes that she is his soul mate, chosen by God. He is also studying the Kabbalah, which is regarded as rather daring for a man under 40. Its discussion of sexual intimacy is restrained but specific, as well as a metaphor for the relationship between Man and God. Emily finds out that the \"inside man\" in the murder plot is the rebbe's adopted daughter Mara, who had been living a disorderly life until Yaakov introduced her to the rebbe. Afterwards, she joined the community as a repentant baalat tshuva, \"one who has returned,\" until a person from her past approached her and she let him into the Diamond Center to steal diamonds worth about $750,000 and kill Yaakov. Shortly after, Emily saves the rebbe's daughter Leah from being scammed by brothers Anthony and Christopher Baldessari, who claim to be Yaakov's killers. Emily instructs her second partner Levine to call for backup and arrests the Baldessaris, but the Baldessaris manage to escape. In the ensuing chase, Levine is injured, while Emily fatally shoots the Baldessaris. Before succumbing to his wounds, Anthony admits to Emily that he and Christopher were not responsible for Yaakov's death. Having solved the case such as Mara now an accessory to murder, Emily rejects Nick's proposal, secretly romances Ariel to overcome her personal problems, and returns to the rebbe's home with him, but finds that Mara has taken Leah hostage. After Emily attempts to negotiate, Mara knocks her out, and Ariel kills Mara with Emily's revolver, avenging Yaakov. Ariel comments that sometimes an evil deed has a partially good result. Emily is hospitalized for an examination, while the rebbe and his family bid her farewell. Ariel and his basherte Shayna Singer get married, in which a reformed Emily watches from a distance. Eventually, she returns to work and catches up with an also reformed Levine, who is on leave and invites her on a two-week trip to Aruba. However, she declines and awaits her bashert.",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. --> In San Francisco, a blonde woman ties retired rock star Johnny Boz to a bed with a silk scarf during sex, then stabs him to death with an ice pick. SFPD Detective Nick Curran and his partner, Gus Moran, investigate the murder. The prime suspect is Boz's girlfriend, crime novelist Catherine Tramell, whose latest novel mirrors the details of the killing. Catherine is uncooperative with the investigators, taunting them by smoking during questioning and exposing herself. Though released for lack of evidence, she becomes a person of interest when Nick learns that she has a history of close relationships with violent individuals. These include her girlfriend Roxanne \"Roxy\" Hardy, who killed her younger brothers as a teenager, and Hazel Dobkins, a convicted family murderer. Nick, a recovering alcoholic with a history of drug abuse and a prior incident in which he accidentally shot two tourists, attends mandatory counseling with police psychologist Dr. Elizabeth Garner, with whom he has an unstable romantic relationship. He discovers that Catherine is using him as the inspiration for a new character—a detective who is murdered after falling for the wrong woman. When Nick suspects that his confidential psychiatric file has been leaked, he assaults internal affairs lieutenant Marty Nilsen, who had access to the file. Nilsen is later found murdered, and Nick is placed on administrative leave. At Boz's nightclub, Nick sees Catherine and Roxy using cocaine. Later, at Catherine's home, she ties Nick to the bed during sex while Roxy watches. Moran expresses concern about Nick's involvement with Catherine and uncovers that Nilsen received a $50,000 payment months before Nick met her. Roxy, jealous of Nick, attempts to kill him in a car attack but dies in the ensuing crash. Catherine reveals that she had an intense relationship with a woman in college who became obsessed with her. Nick suspects the woman was Garner, who claims the obsession went the other way. Investigating further, Nick finds that Nilsen had withdrawn a complaint Catherine filed against Garner years earlier. He also uncovers that a professor shared by Garner and Catherine was killed with an ice pick in an unsolved case resembling Catherine's fiction, and that Garner's former husband was murdered in another unresolved case investigated by Nilsen. Nick finds the draft of Catherine's new novel, which depicts a detective discovering his partner's body in an elevator. Catherine abruptly ends their relationship. Later, Moran tells Nick he has arranged to meet Catherine's former college roommate in Oakland to learn more about her and Garner. When Nick arrives, he finds Moran stabbed to death with an ice pick in an elevator, mirroring the novel. Garner arrives shortly afterward, claiming she was lured there by a message. Believing she is reaching for a weapon, Nick shoots and kills her, but she is found to be unarmed. Police find evidence in Garner's apartment implicating her in multiple murders, including files and photographs related to Catherine. Nick is left confused and emotionally shaken. Later, Catherine returns to Nick's apartment and they have sex. As they lie in bed discussing their future, an ice pick lies unseen beneath the bed.",

Upon his arrival in the town with fields of crutches protruding from the ground, Felicien finds the area to be a surreal dream world where visions and miracles are such ordinary occurrences they become a nuisance. The dogs of the town are sacred animals and the people of the town are the sleep walking undead. Felicien finds his way to a mansion where Anthony, the wealthy owner of the factory that produces prosthetic limbs, resides with his wife Ines. After sitting through a very bizarre dinner with the residents of the mansion Felicien has an equally strange dream involving the couple. While exploring the town Felicien meets a priest buried in the ground by Ellis, an artist who uses corpses to make living paintings and who looks identical to one of Felicien's psychiatric patients. The priest is exhausted by the endless miracles, as it is his job to excommunicate people for performing miracles not authorized by the church. Felicien continues to have strange encounters that blur the lines between illusion and the real, including conversations with Le Marquis, who inhabits the same body as Anthony, and the Virgin Mary who mimics and mocks Felicien when she appears before him. He also meets a young boy who performs miracles and helps Felicien out when he can't find a bathroom and needs to urinate. One of Felicien's more unusual encounters is with a giant sculpture of a finger made from marble that crashes through the ceiling of the guest room of the mansion, nearly crushing him. Felicien explores Anthony's mansion to find a basement laboratory where disturbing experiments are performed. Felicien learns that doubles of Anthony and Ines were created in the lab when their souls left their bodies one night. The couple's souls wander and sometimes occupy the body of Le Marquis. Towards the end of the film Felicien visits the laboratory again and gets thrown out of the lab where he finds himself stuck levitating in the air against his will. The miracle performing boy attempts to help him get back on the ground, but must first get permission to perform the miracle. In the meantime the priest lassoes a rope around Felicien and leads him around. Eventually the miracle boy is able to help him down to the ground. Felicien rushes back to the laboratory when he hears Le Marquis is dying to wish him farewell. Felicien finally leaves the strange town, floating away as he walks towards the sky.",

    "Synopsis": "The film begins by showing Antonio López García as a very meticulous painter. He drives in pegs to mark his stance, hangs a weight and uses strings to determine the symmetry and center of his painting. His first attempt starts out peacefully but he soon encounters problems due to the weather and the size of his canvas. As López and a friend discuss Michelangelo's The Last Judgement, painted when Michelangelo was in his 60s, which López is fast approaching, the film's subject takes shape as the relationship between the artist's work and his own mortality. López's future attempts are much more rushed and frantic as he struggles to compete with the weather, the fleeting sun and the rotting and weighed down fruit in maintaining his vision.",

    "film_title": "Howards End (film)",
    "Synopsis": "In Edwardian Britain, Helen Schlegel becomes engaged to Paul Wilcox during a moment of passion, while staying at the Wilcox family's country home, Howards End. The Schlegels are an intellectual family of Anglo-German bourgeoisie, while the Wilcoxes are conservative and wealthy, led by hard-headed businessman Henry. Helen and Paul quickly decide against the engagement, but she has already sent a telegram informing her sister Margaret, leading to an uproar when the sisters' Aunt Juley arrives and causes a scene. Months later in London, the Wilcoxes take a flat across the street from the Schlegels, whom they had met the previous year in Germany, and Margaret resumes her acquaintance with Ruth, Henry's wife. Howards End is owned by Ruth, and is her beloved childhood home, inherited from her family. The two women grow close as Mrs. Wilcox's health declines and, unbeknownst to Margaret, Ruth bequeaths Howards End to her on her death bed. However, the Wilcoxes refuse to believe Ruth would leave the house to a relative stranger and burn her informally-written directions. Henry develops an attraction to Margaret, assisting her in finding a new home and eventually proposing marriage, which she accepts. The Schlegels have befriended Leonard Bast, a self-improving young clerk who lives with Jacky, a woman of dubious origins. The sisters pass along advice from Henry to the effect that the insurance company Leonard works for is heading for bankruptcy. As a result Leonard quits and settles for a much lower-paying job, which is eventually eliminated so he has no employment. Helen is later enraged to learn Henry's advice was wrong; Leonard's first employer was perfectly sound but will not re-employ him. Months later, Henry and Margaret host the wedding of his daughter Evie at his Shropshire estate. Margaret is shocked when Helen arrives with the impoverished Leonard and Jacky. Considering Henry responsible for their plight, Helen demands his help, but Jacky drunkenly exposes Henry as a former lover from years ago. Henry is ashamed to be revealed as an adulterer, but Margaret forgives him and agrees to send the Basts away. Helen, upset with Margaret's decision to marry a man she now loathes, leaves for Germany, but not before giving in to her attraction for Leonard and having sex while out boating. Fearing the Basts will be penniless, Helen instructs her brother Tibby to give them over £5000 of her own money, but Leonard returns the cheque uncashed out of pride, and because of his own feelings for Helen. Margaret and Henry marry, arranging to use Howards End as storage for Margaret's and her siblings' belongings. After months of hearing from Helen only through postcards, Margaret grows concerned. Helen returns to England when Aunt Juley falls ill, but avoids seeing her family. Believing Helen is mentally unstable, Margaret lures her to Howards End to collect her belongings, arriving herself with Henry and a doctor, and finds Helen is pregnant. Insisting on returning to Germany to raise her baby alone, Helen asks to stay the night at Howards End but Henry adamantly refuses, leading to an argument with Margaret. Leonard, still living unhappily in poverty with Jacky, has a dream about how he first met Helen. Discovering that he wants to see her again, he travels to Howards End, arriving to find a very pregnant Helen, Margaret, and Henry's brutish eldest son, Charles. Realising Leonard is the baby's father, Charles assaults him for \"dishonouring\" Helen, and a bookcase collapses on Leonard, who dies of a heart attack. Margaret tells Henry that she is leaving him to help Helen raise her baby, and Henry breaks down, telling her the police inquest will charge Charles with manslaughter. A year later, Paul, Evie, and Charles's wife, Dolly, gather at Howards End. Henry and Margaret are still together, living with Helen and her young son. A visibly aged Henry tells the others that upon his death, Margaret will inherit Howards End and leave it to her nephew, but Margaret wants none of Henry's money, which will be split among his children. She overhears Dolly point out the irony of Margaret's inheriting the house, revealing Mrs. Wilcox's dying wish to leave it to her. Henry tells Margaret he did what he thought was right, but she says nothing.",

    "Synopsis": "Set in a post-perestroika, post-Soviet Moscow, Luna Park follows the main character Andrei Leonov (Andrei Gutin) in his struggles to figure out who he is. At the beginning of the film, we see him as a young antisemitic skinhead bodybuilding leader of a group called \"The Cleaners\" who are set on purging Russia of anyone they deem unsuitable to the Russian bloodline, including, Jews, homosexuals, foreigners and mentally challenged individuals. The opening scene depicts a crowd of skinheads waving Russian flags and fighting a gang of bikers who they believed have succumbed to western influence and ideology. \"The Cleaners\" live in Luna Park, an amusement park, with wild roller coasters, and distorting mirrors and regularly head out into Moscow to cause chaos and destruction. Having originally believed that his father was a Soviet war hero who died in a military plane crash in Afghanistan, he worships his father as the ideal Russian and strives to emulate him. When during a drunken night of confessions, he discovers that his father is actually a Jewish musician and still alive in Moscow, Andrei's life is turned upside-down, partly out of revulsion from whom he is descended, and partly because he wants to know (and be) with his father, and he must someway reconcile himself with this discovery. Andrei's initial reaction of shock is furthered by his mother Aliona (Natalya Yegorova), who demands he kill his father for the pain that he caused her, when at a young age, his father seduced her (making her pregnant) and then did not cast her as a singer for an important role, which blighted her career after that. As the movie progresses, Andrei's quest for his father is successful, and we are introduced to Naoum Kheifitz (Oleg Borisov), a once-influential Jewish composer and conductor who is now forced to make a living as an entertainer at private parties. Having spent time with his father, and seeing him as a charming, personable, yet impoverished gentle man, Andrei begins to overcome his hatred for Jewish culture. His father accepts Andrei and dismisses his antisemitism, and proudly shows him off to his eccentric friends. This leads to a gradual change of Andrei's perspective, and he attempts to explain the situation to the members of his gang. They are not as accepting of his father, or of Andrei's Jewish roots, and they ransack Naoum's apartment, hang a young woman they find there, and abduct Naoum, taking him back to Luna Park. Andrei returns to the apartment and is horrified at the sight. He rushes to the park and saves his father, meanwhile the park catches fire, and Aliona chooses to perish with the park than face the reality of Andrei's choice. The movie concludes with a scene of Andrei and Naoum getting on a train that's traveling to Siberia, under the assumption that they will start a new life together, free from the influence of the gang or the city.",

    "Synopsis": "In Mile End, Montreal, Léo Lauzon is a young boy living in a tenement with his dysfunctional family, serving as the unreliable narrator. He uses his active fantasy life and the book L'avalée des avalés by Québécois novelist Réjean Ducharme to escape the reality of his life. He feels his father is insane and denies being his son. After having a dream revealing his mother was impregnated after falling into a cart of tomatoes contaminated by an Italian man's semen, Léo identifies as Italian rather than French Canadian and adopts the name Léolo Lozone. 200px|thumb|Léolo reads L'avalée des avalés by Réjean Ducharme. Growing up in an apartment with a rat in the bathtub, a turkey and a family obsessed with regular bowel movements, Léolo continues to write. His writings are discovered by the Word Tamer, a reincarnation of Don Quixote, who searches through trash for letters and photographs. Léolo observes a neighbouring young woman named Bianca and imagines her singing to him from a closet, emitting a white light. His grandfather, who Léolo believes attempted to murder him by holding him under a pool, helps her financially and extorts her for sexual favours, revealing her breasts and putting his feet in her mouth. Léolo begins to fantasize about Bianca sexually and discovers masturbation. Meanwhile, his brother Fernand, after being beaten by a bully and having failed a special education class, builds up muscles. Word Tamer, continuously monitoring Léolo's thoughts, reads the boy's hopes about how Fernand's muscles will make them invincible. However, upon being confronted by the bully for the second time, Fernand is overwhelmed with fear and is beaten again while Léolo watches in shock. Finally convinced his grandfather is responsible for all of the family's troubles, Léolo attempts to lower a noose and hang his grandfather while he is in the bath. His grandfather sees Léolo doing it and is choked, before finally being freed, with Léolo injured in the process. Léolo subsequently goes to the hospital, where he is told his actions could constitute attempted murder, though he is not charged. Reacting with horror to the ways other boys are pursuing sex, he seeks out the services of a prostitute named Regina. Upon later becoming ill, he ends up in the same institution where many other members of his family have been treated.",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. --> <!--Do not add the year, it was never specified.--> The film opens with George Milton reminiscing in a boxcar. During the Great Depression, quick-witted George Milton and physically strong but mentally disabled Lennie Small are fleeing their previous employment, where Lennie was accused of attempted rape after he tore a woman’s dress, prompted by his love of stroking soft things. They manage to evade a posse of men sending dogs after Lennie. They travel to work on Tyler Ranch near Soledad. George agrees to tell Lennie again about their dream, describing how they will one day have their own piece of land where Lennie will tend their rabbits. At Tyler Ranch, the Boss is suspicious of Lennie's mental condition. George lies to the boss claiming Lennie is his cousin and was kicked in the head by a horse as a child. They befriend old one-handed ranch-hand Candy; but Curley, the Boss's son and an arrogant boxer, torments them. Curley's wife flirts with them, and George instructs Lenny to stay away from her. George meets their colleagues, respected headman Slim, and Carlson, who suggests they shoot Candy's sick dog and give him one of Slim's puppies. After a hard day, George is proud of Lennie's work and gets him his puppy. Candy offers to pitch in with Lennie and George to buy their farm. Just as it seems their dream is moving closer, Curley accuses Slim of keeping his wife company. Curley attacks Lennie for laughing, goading him to fight back. Prompted by George, Lennie crushes Curley's hand. George fears for their jobs but Slim gives Curley an ultimatum: if Curley tries to get George and Lennie fired, Slim will humiliate Curley by telling everyone how Curley's hand really got crushed. Concerned for his reputation, Curley reluctantly agrees to say his hand got caught in a machine. Lennie talks about being lonely and Curley's wife attempts to engage him in conversation. Frustrated, she runs to the house in tears vowing to leave the ranch forever. In the barn that evening, Lennie has accidentally killed his puppy and is greatly upset. Curley's wife enters and admits her loneliness, confiding that her dreams of being a movie star were crushed. Learning of Lennie's love of petting soft things, she lets him stroke her hair. She soon complains that he is pulling too hard and begins to scream which confuses Lennie. Trying to keep her quiet, Lennie accidentally breaks her neck. He runs to hide in the brush as George told him to do if in trouble. Candy finds Curley's wife dead and informs George, who then pretends not to know until Candy informs everyone else. George secretly steals Carlson's gun. Curley leads a lynch mob but George finds Lennie first. George realizes that escape is impossible this time, so he calms Lennie by retelling him their dream. As George gets to the part where Lennie tends the rabbits, he shoots Lennie in the back of the head, sparing him pain and death at the hands of the mob. The scene returns to George, alone in the boxcar, heading South, sadly remembering his life with Lennie.",

    "Synopsis": "In the early 20th century, Henrik Bergman is studying to be a parish minister under the Church of Sweden. A poor man, he meets the wealthy Anna Åkerblom through his friend, Anna's brother Ernst. Anna is vain and stubborn, and in Henrik's belief she is elitist, yet she is also attractive and capable of enjoying pleasure. Although Henrik lives in a sexual relationship with Frida, a waitress, Anna seduces him and proposes an engagement. As Henrik and Anna begin to see more of each other, Henrik secretly continues living with Frida. While speaking with Anna's mother Karin, Henrik confesses that he feels unwelcome among the Åkerbloms. Karin tells him frankly that she feels Anna needs a mature man who can nurture her, but he is lacking on both counts. Karin also tells Anna that Henrik is still living with Frida, a fact verified by the family. Henrik and Anna stop seeing each other until Frida appeals to Anna to take Henrik back, citing his misery. While Anna is treated for tuberculosis in Switzerland, a brother is sent to tell Henrik that she no longer wishes to speak to him. However, unknown to her parents, Anna sends a letter to Ernst to be forwarded to Henrik, telling him she wishes to resume their relationship. Her parents receive the letter and Anna's father Johan opens it, after which Karin reads it and burns it. After Johan dies, Karin confesses the act to Anna, who angrily seeks Henrik. By then, Henrik is planning to go to Forsboda, a remote village in northern Sweden, to work in a parish whose head minister is aged and ailing. Anna resolves to go with him, and they marry despite their class conflicts. The Bergmans have their first son, Dag, but Henrik becomes embroiled in the local strike action, as he refuses to endorse poor working conditions and lends his church for a socialist meeting. This displeases Nordenson, who also dislikes Bergman's manner of instruction of Nordenson's daughters, as Nordenson refuses to kneel with his wife and girls. In the meantime, the Bergmans take in Petrus, a troubled orphaned boy. Later, Henrik and Anna are unexpectedly summoned to Stockholm to meet Queen Victoria, who chairs a board managing Sophiahemmet Hospital and is seeking a chaplain, with the archbishop recommending Henrik. During the meeting, Victoria asks him if he believes suffering is sent by God. He replies suffering is useless and God views the world with horror, and leaves the palace fuming at having to flatter the Queen. The Bergmans decline the position, but the villagers are upset they did not hear of the offer except through rumours, and are disturbed by Henrik publicly humiliating Nordenson in church. Upset, and expecting her second child, Anna insists on sending Petrus away, saying she did not agree to a permanent adoption and she dislikes the boy. Petrus overhears the conversation, and furious, kidnaps Dag and carries him to an icy river. The Bergmans see them and give chase, with Henrik saving Dag and slapping down Petrus, after which the boy leaves. In despair, Anna decides she can no longer live in Forsboda and takes Dag to the Åkerblom house, while Henrik at first resolves to stay in the village. He finally accepts the position in Stockholm and asks Anna to come with him, and she replies this is all she wants.",

    "Synopsis": "Griffin Mill is a Hollywood studio executive dating story editor Bonnie Sherow. He hears story pitches from screenwriters and decides which have the potential to be made into films, green-lighting only twelve out of 50,000 submissions every year. His job is threatened when up-and-coming exec Larry Levy begins working at the studio. Mill has also been receiving death threat postcards, assumed to be from a screenwriter whose pitch he rejected. Mill surmises that the disgruntled writer is David Kahane, and Kahane's girlfriend June Gudmundsdottir tells him that Kahane is at the Rialto Theater in South Pasadena, at a screening of The Bicycle Thief. Mill pretends to recognize Kahane in the lobby and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar where Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mill's offer, calling him a liar and continuing to goad him about his job security at the studio. In the bar's parking lot, the two men fight. Mill goes too far and drowns Kahane in a shallow pool of water while screaming, \"Keep it to yourself!\" Mill then stages the crime to make it look like a botched robbery. The next day, after Mill is late for and distracted at a meeting, studio security chief Walter Stuckel confronts him about the murder and says that the police know that he was the last one to see Kahane alive. At the end of their conversation Mill receives a fax from his stalker. Thus, Mill has killed the wrong man, and the stalker apparently knows this. Mill attends Kahane's funeral and gets into conversation with Gudmundsdottir. Detectives Avery and DeLongpre suspect Mill is guilty of murder. Mill receives a postcard from the stalker suggesting that they meet at a hotel bar. While Mill is waiting, he is cornered by two screenwriters, Tom Oakley and Andy Sivella, who pitch Habeas Corpus, a legal drama featuring no major stars and with a depressing ending. Because Mill is not alone, his stalker does not appear. After leaving the bar, Mill receives a fax in his car, advising him to look under his raincoat. He discovers a live rattlesnake in a box and, terrified, bludgeons it with his umbrella. Mill tells Gudmundsdottir that his near-death experience made him realize he has feelings for her. Apprehensive that Levy continues encroaching on his job, Mill invites the two writers to pitch Habeas Corpus to him, convincing Levy that the movie will be an Oscar contender. Mill's plan is to let Levy shepherd the film through production and have it flop. Mill will step in at the last moment, suggesting some changes to salvage the film's box office, letting him reclaim his position at the studio. Having persuaded Sherow to leave for New York on studio business, Mill takes Gudmundsdottir to a Hollywood awards banquet and their relationship blossoms. After Sherow confronts Mill about his relationship with Gudmundsdottir, Mill coldly severs their relationship in front of two writers. Mill takes Gudmundsdottir to an isolated Desert Hot Springs resort and spa. In the middle of Mill and Gudmundsdottir making love, Mill confesses his role in Kahane's murder, and Gudmundsdottir responds by saying she loves him. Mill's attorney informs him that studio head Joel Levison has been fired, and that the Pasadena police want Mill to participate in a lineup. An eyewitness has come forward, but she fails to identify Mill. One year later, studio power players are watching the end of Habeas Corpus with a new, tacked-on, upbeat ending and famous actors in the lead roles. Mill's plan to save the movie has worked and he is head of the studio. Gudmundsdottir is now Mill's wife and pregnant with his child. Sherow objects to the film's new ending and is fired by Levy. Mill rebuffs her when she appeals her termination to him. Mill receives a pitch over the phone from Levy and a man who reveals himself as the postcard writer. The man pitches an idea about a studio executive who kills a writer and gets away with murder. Recognizing the pitch as blackmail, Mill gives the writer a deal, if he can guarantee an ending in which the executive lives happily with the writer's widow. The writer's title for the film is The Player.",

    "film_title": "The Stolen Children",
    "Synopsis": "11-year-old Rosetta and 9-year old Luciano live with their mother in the housing projects of Milan. Internal migrants from Sicily, they face prejudice in their adopted city. Their mother is unemployed and their father has long since abandoned them. For the past two years, the mother has hired her daughter out as a prostitute. The authorities raid the place and arrest the mother and a client. The children are destined to be sent to a Catholic orphanage in Civitavecchia, near Rome. Two carabinieri, the rookie Antonio and an older man named Grignani are assigned the thankless task of escorting the children there by train. Grignani walks out on Antonio at Bologna, leaving Antonio to complete the task alone. The children are unruly, often fighting or running off in different directions. Luciano is sickly, doesn't eat much and rarely speaks. Rosetta is cynical, rebellious and manipulative. When they arrive at the orphanage, the priest in charge tells Antonio that the children cannot stay because Rosetta's medical record is missing. Antonio suspects that they are using this as a pretext because of her background as a prostitute. Antonio calls Grignani at the number he provided and explains the situation, but Grignani is no help. Rather than contact his superiors for further instructions and expose his partner's misconduct, Antonio naively decides to take matters into his own hands and bring the children to another institute in their native Sicily. His plan immediately runs into problems when Luciano has an asthma attack on the way to the train station, causing them to miss the train. They spend an awkward night at the bachelor pad of a carabiniere acquaintance of Antonio's. After a long train and coach journey, the trio arrive unannounced at Antonio's sister's home in Calabria, which doubles as a restaurant. There they celebrate a young girl's First Communion. Antonio tells his family that Rosetta and Luciano are the children of one of his superiors. Given a stylish age-appropriate summer dress to wear, Rosetta plays and socializes with other girls her age, while Luciano is befriended by Antonio's grandmother, who gives him a photo of a six-year-old Antonio in a Zorro costume. Their fun, however, is short-lived as one of the guests at the party recognizes Rosetta from an article in a tabloid magazine and exposes her past to the other guests. Rosetta, humiliated and ashamed, dashes from the house. Antonio runs after her and comforts her, saying the woman is an idiot and it doesn't matter what she thinks. Antonio has cracked through Rosetta's tough exterior and now feels a genuine sense of compassion for her and her brother, rather than a simple sense of duty. Antonio, who has acquired an old Fiat 128, agrees to remove Rosetta from the place immediately, and drives them to the ferry terminal at the Strait of Messina. On the ferry, he finally has a conversation with Luciano. Rather than driving directly to the orphanage in Gela, he takes another detour, taking them to a cheap hotel near Marina di Ragusa where he rents two adjoining rooms. The next day, they visit the beach, where he teaches Luciano to swim, forming a close bond with him. There, they meet two young French women, who take a liking to Rosetta. The five of them drive to Noto and visit the Noto Cathedral. One of the tourists gives Rosetta her camera, which is then snatched from her. Antonio chases down the thief and arrests him, taking him to the local police station. At the station, one of the tourists learns of the background of the children, and insensitively talks about it with her friend. When Rosetta overhears the word \"prostitute\" her friendly demeanour towards the women instantly disappears. Antonio is accused of kidnapping and abusing the children, and failure to follow orders. He is forced to hand in his warrant card pending a court martial. After several hours they are all released. Antonio drives the children to Gela late into the night. Upset at the probable loss of his career, he says very little during the journey. Having nearly reached their final destination, Antonio pulls over to an abandoned block where all three of them fall asleep in the car. The children wake up at early dawn, and walk off to the side of the road, where they sit together and talk about their future in the orphanage.",

    "Synopsis": "Steve Malone, an agent from the Environmental Protection Agency, is sent to a U.S. Army base in Alabama to test possible effects on the surrounding ecological system caused by military actions. With him are Marti, his teenage daughter from his first marriage; Carol, his second wife; and Andy, Marti's half-brother. On their way to the base, they stop at a gas station. In the restroom, Marti is threatened by an MP with a knife. When he notices her fear, he warns, \"They get you when you sleep\", and lets her go. Steve and his family move into their new home on the base, and Marti makes friends with the base commander's daughter Jenn. On his first day in day care, Andy runs away because he is recognized as an outsider among the other conformist children. He is picked up and brought home by helicopter pilot Tim. Marti and Tim are attracted to each other. While examining soil samples, Steve is asked by medical officer Major Collins if the toxicity of the environment could have caused an ongoing rash of people afraid to sleep and believing their loved ones are imposters. In the evening, Marti and Jenn go to the bar attended by the station's military personnel, where they meet Tim and the MP who threatened Marti at the gas station. With no emotion, he denies that they ever met before. A group of soldiers pick giant pods from the river running by the base. When Andy wakes up and enters his mother's room, Carol's body crumbles to dust, while a naked soulless double emerges from the closet. Nobody believes Andy's story that his real mother is dead. The following day, Steve witnesses an accidental injury on a soldier that makes no sense. Steve takes a sample from the injured soldier's suit and speaks to a friend over the phone about examining the specimen. That night, Marti falls asleep during a bath and tendrils emerging from the giant pods enter her mouth and nose. Carol coaxes Steve to sleep and tendrils enter him as well. Marti wakes, rips the tendrils from her face, rushes into Steve's room, and wakes him. The tendril removal causes doubles of Marti and Steve to collapse and dissolve. Carol attempts to convince Steve that the takeover is a good thing, claiming that it ends confusion and anger. She also claims that there is no place to go, as the events at the base are not an isolated incident. Steve, Marti, and Andy flee the house. Carol emits a mechanical scream that alerts other pod people. Now the majority, they swarm over the base chasing the remaining humans. Tim is attacked by his friends but escapes. After hiding Marti and Andy in a warehouse, Steve enters Collins' office. The hysterical Major calls for help, but the line is blocked. A group of pod people arrive, led by base commander General Platt. While Steve hides, the pod people try to convince Collins that the individual is not important, and that only conformity can solve the world's problems. Collins shoots himself rather than live in such a world. Steve returns to his children and says he found a way out. They drive aimlessly through the military base, as loudspeakers shout out instructions for spreading the invasion by carrying out pods in trucks. Realizing that her father was replicated while he was away, Marti swerves the car to the side and tries to escape with Andy. Tim arrives and Marti takes his gun and shoots the Steve duplicate. Pod-Steve's body shrinks into a mass of goo. Tim gets hold of a helicopter gunship, but Marti and Andy are taken away by the pod people to the base infirmary, where the remaining human beings are being systematically duplicated by pods. Tim rescues Marti, despite her pod duplicate having already awakened. Marti and Tim leave the building, pretending to be pod people so they can get to Tim's helicopter to escape. Jenn greets them without emotion, but surreptitiously tells Marti she saw Andy looking for her. When Marti reacts with interest, Jenn alerts the other pod people. Tim and Marti get in the helicopter and Andy runs up to them. After taking off, Andy, who is actually a pod duplicate, tries to bring down the helicopter. After a scuffle, a heartbroken Marti throws Pod-Andy out of the helicopter to his death. Tim destroys the base and the trucks filled with pods with the helicopter's rockets. While they land on another base, the words of Pod-Carol can be heard, suggesting that the phenomenon may have already spread beyond the army base.",

    "Synopsis": "William Foster is stuck in Los Angeles traffic on a hot day. After his air conditioning fails, he abandons his car and begins walking, carrying his briefcase. At a convenience store, the Korean owner refuses to give change for a telephone call. Foster becomes agitated over the high prices. The owner grabs a baseball bat and demands that Foster leave. Foster takes the bat and destroys several merchandise displays before paying for a drink and leaving. Later, while resting on a hill, he is harassed by two Mexican gang members, who threaten him with a knife and demand his briefcase. Foster attacks them with the bat and takes their knife. The gang members, now in a car with two associates, find Foster using a payphone. They open fire, killing four bystanders, but not Foster. The driver crashes. Foster picks up a weapon they had, shoots the surviving gang member in the leg, and then leaves with their bag of weapons. Foster encounters a panhandler who harasses him for change. Foster gives him the briefcase, which only contains his lunch. At a fast-food restaurant, Foster attempts to order breakfast, but is told they have switched to the lunch menu. After an argument with the manager, Foster pulls a gun and fires into the ceiling accidentally. After trying to reassure the frightened employees and customers, he orders lunch, but is annoyed when the burger looks nothing like the one pictured. He leaves and tries to place a call from a phone booth, then shoots the booth to pieces after being hassled by someone who was waiting to use the phone. After Foster calls \"home\" again and states his intention to attend his daughter's birthday party, his ex-wife Beth notifies the police as she has a restraining order against him. Sergeant Martin Prendergast, who is on his last day of duty before being coaxed into retirement by his wife, insists on investigating the events. Interviews with witnesses lead Prendergast to suspect that the same person is responsible for all of them. Foster's vanity license plate proves to be an important lead, because Prendergast remembers being in the same traffic jam as Foster. Prendergast and his partner, Detective Sandra Torres, visit Foster's mother, who is surprised to learn that he lost his job. They realize Foster is heading toward his former family's home in Venice and rush to intercept him. Foster passes a bank where a black man is protesting after being rejected for a loan. The man exchanges a glance with Foster and says, \"Don't forget me,\" as police escort him away. Foster stops at a military surplus store to buy boots. The owner, a homophobic Neo-Nazi, diverts Torres when she comes in. After Torres leaves, the owner offers Foster a rocket launcher and congratulates him for the restaurant shooting incident. When Foster expresses distaste for the store owner's bigotry, the man becomes violent and attempts to turn him over to the police, but Foster stabs him then shoots him dead. Foster changes into tactical clothes, takes the rocket launcher, and leaves. Foster encounters a road repair crew who are not working and accuses them of doing unnecessary repairs to justify their budget. He pulls out the rocket launcher but struggles to use it, until a boy explains how it works. Foster accidentally fires the launcher, blowing up the construction site. By the time Foster reaches Beth's house, she has already fled with their daughter. He realizes that they may have gone to the nearby Venice Pier, but Prendergast and Torres arrive before he can pursue them. Foster shoots Torres, injuring her, and flees with Prendergast in pursuit. At the pier, Foster confronts his ex-wife and daughter. Adele is happy to see him, but Beth wants him to leave. Prendergast arrives and distracts Foster long enough for Beth to throw his gun into the ocean. Prendergast aims his gun at Foster and urges him to surrender, acknowledging his complaints about social inequalities but not accepting them as an excuse for his rampage. With nothing left for him, Foster tricks Prendergast into killing him. Having asserted himself, Prendergast decides to hold off retirement.",

    "Synopsis": "Cassiel and Raphaella, two angels, observe the busy life of reunited Berlin. Due to their divine origin, they can hear the thoughts of the people around them, and try to console a dying man. Cassiel has been following his friend Damiel (a former angel), who senses his presence and talks about his experiences as a human. He owns a pizza parlor named Casa dell'angelo (Angel's House) and has married Marion, a trapeze artist whom he met when he was an angel. She works in a local bar in West Berlin, and the two have a young daughter, Doria. Cassiel follows Raissa Becker, an 11-year-old girl who lives in the former East Berlin. He observes her life and notices that she and her mother Hanna Becker are being followed by Philip Winter, a detective who works for Anton Baker. Baker is an American arms dealer and pornographer who owns a transport company. Cassiel follows Becker and Winter into an abandoned building. As Raphaella and Cassiel sit on top of the Brandenburg Gate, he expresses a desire to experience human life. Visiting Raissa, he finds her alone at her flat and leaning over the balcony railing. As she falls, Cassiel tries to save her and suddenly becomes human, catching the child. He has to adjust to the transformation, learning to modulate the volume of his voice and to negotiate streets and avoid being hit by cars. His only possession is an angel's armor, which became tangible when he leaped into humanity. In the subway, Cassiel is tricked into gambling by Emit Flesti ('Time Itself'), losing his armor and money won during the game. Raphaella begs Flesti to give Cassiel time to understand what it is to be a human; he agrees but does not promise to stop hunting him. Arrested and detained, Cassiel struggles to satisfy police demands for identification. He cannot give (or comprehend) his name or address, but refers the police to his friend's pizza shop. Damiel arrives at the station and takes his now human friend home. Tricked by Flesti into drinking alcohol, he becomes addicted and robs a shop with a gun taken from a teenager, who had been planning to kill his abusive stepfather. Cassiel begins begging to make his way and feigns a car accident with Baker to compel him to pay for the forging of a passport and birth certificate he has ordered under the name Karl Engel (Charles Angel). Baker hires Cassiel as his valet, to pass him cards for cheating his fellow gangsters at poker. Stopping by Casa dell'Angelo to return items borrowed from Damiel, Cassiel encounters Flesti again. He is collecting money from Damiel, after having loaned him money to set up the business. After Cassiel saves Baker's life, Baker makes Cassiel his partner. But after learning the true nature of his business, Cassiel decides to leave Baker's service and stop him. Winter is killed by Flesti. With the help of Damiel and former angel Peter Falk, Cassiel gets into Baker's airport storage area. His team takes all the weapons and destroy the pornography copying machines. They send the weapons to a barge owned by other friends. Once having completed the plan, Cassiel feels ready to live as a human, but Flesti reports that Baker's rival, Patzke, has hijacked the barge with Baker's and Cassiel's friends inside. Becker is also captured and reunites with his sister, Hannah, on board. Flesti reveals himself as Time and says that he has to make Cassiel understand he does not belong in the human world; he has a word written on his forehead. At a boat lift, Cassiel gets on the barge and frees Raissa, moments before he is killed. Flesti slows time so the rest can take over the barge and save the entire party. Cassiel's friends are saddened by his death, but when Damiel hears a ring in his ear, he understands that Cassiel has been reinstated as an angel and is near, and Damiel laughs in joy.",

    "Synopsis": "In Peking, a young boy by the name of Douzi is abandoned by his prostitute mother to a Peking opera troupe supervised by Master Guan, who like many other opera troupe leaders, would take in orphaned children as apprentices. There, Douzi is mocked by the other children for his mother's origin, but nonetheless is befriended by another boy about his age, Shitou, a boy with a talent for breaking stones with his head. As teenagers, Douzi trains to play dan (female heroine roles), while Shitou learns jing (male hero roles). When practicing the play Dreaming of the World Outside the Nunnery, Douzi mistakes the line \"I am by nature a girl, not a boy\" with \"I am by nature a boy, not a girl,\" for which he receives severe physical punishment. Douzi and another student, Laizi, attempt to run away; Laizi buys candied hawthorns using Douzi's few coins, but Douzi decides to pursue acting seriously after being moved by an opera performance. Upon returning, they find the whole troupe being punished for their desertion, and Douzi steps in and is beaten in Shitou's place. As a result, Laizi eats the hawthorns and later hangs himself. Na Kun, an agent who provides funding for opera plays, comes to the troupe to seek potential actors. When Douzi repeats the same mistake in front of the agent, Shitou commands him to start over. Douzi finally delivers the entire monologue successfully and secures Na Kun's patronage. The troupe is invited to perform for eunuch Zhang. Shitou and Douzi are brought to Zhang's house where they find a finely crafted sword, which Shitou promises to one day gift to Douzi, as the hero would do for his concubine. Zhang asks to meet Douzi in his room and sexually assaults him. Shitou implicitly knows what happened, although Douzi does not speak of the assault. On their way home, Douzi rescues an abandoned baby, who later comes under Master Guan's training. Years later, Douzi and Shitou have become Peking opera stars, taking the names Cheng Dieyi and Duan Xiaolou, respectively. Their signature performance is the play Farewell My Concubine, where Cheng Dieyi plays Consort Yu and Duan Xiaolou plays Xiang Yu; before every play, Dieyi would finish the stage makeup for Xiaolou as a small act of love. Their fame attracts the attention of the high-ranking Yuan Shiqing when he attends their performances. Yuan has come to possess the sword from Zhang's house, which he gives to Dieyi as a gift. Though pursued by Yuan, Dieyi is secretly in love with Xiaolou, who frequents a brothel where he meets Juxian, a headstrong prostitute who buys her freedom using her silk shoes after meeting Xialou to be with him; when Xiaolou marries Juxian, Dieyi and Xiaolou's relationship begins to fall apart, Dieyi refusing to continue finishing Xiaolou's stage makeup. The love triangle between Dieyi, Xiaolou, and Juxian leads to jealousy and betrayal, further complicated by political upheaval following the Second Sino-Japanese War. When Master Guan dies, the abandoned baby, now Xiao Si, comes under Dieyi's training to continue learning dan roles. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the opera is closed by the Japanese and Xiaolou is jailed. Juxian begs for Dieyi to help free him, so Dieyi agrees to play his signature role for the Japanese in order for Xiaolou to be released, as he claims the Japanese are able to appreciate the quality of the play. After the war, the Kuomintang military barge into the opera and arrest Dieyi for his performance in front of the Japanese invaders, an act which is considered as treason. His arrest triggers a fight in which Juxian loses the baby she was carrying. Desperate to save Dieyi, Xiaolou and Juxian turn to Yuan for help, who initially refuses, until Juxian reminds him it was him who allowed the Japanese entry to the opera and blackmails him by threatening to tell on him. During the trial, the witnesses commit perjury, claiming that Dieyi was tortured and forced to perform at gunpoint, which he denies when called to testify. The military interrupts the trial and Dieyi is freed under bail in order to perform for the new government. Afterwards, Dieyi becomes addicted to opium. alt=Two Peking operas on stage, performing the final act in \"The Hegemon-King bids His Concubine Farewell\"|left|thumb|348x348px|Ending of the play The Hegemon-King Bids His Lady Farewell|of the same name performed in 2007.

Dieyi's addiction negatively affects his performances and renders him unable to sing, but he is ultimately rehabilitated with the help of Xiaolou and Juxian. Xiao Si nurtures resentment against Dieyi because of his rigorous teachings and usurps his role in Farewell My Concubine in the middle of a performance. Xiaolou initially refuses to perform with Xiao Si, but the latter implicitly threatens him with the politics of not performing for the masses, and Xiaolou continues the performance. Devastated by the betrayal, Dieyi secludes himself and refuses to reconcile with Xiaolou. As the Cultural Revolution continues, the Peking Opera is prohibited and replaced with Maoist plays. The entire opera troupe is forced into a struggle session, accused by Xiao Si and Na Kun, by Red Guards. The opera troupe is forced to dress up and is paraded around town while being ridiculed by their captors as well as bystanders. Xiaolou's mighty and meaningful stage makeup becomes smudged after being beaten up by the Red Guards: Dieyi, in full costume of Consort Yu, calmly picks up the brush and finishes the stage makeup for a humiliated and weakened Xiaolou. Then, under pressure, Xiaolou accuses Dieyi of counterrevolutionary acts. After Xiaolou implies Dieyi is homosexual, Dieyi tells the guards that Juxian was a prostitute. To protect himself from further persecution, Xiaolou swears that he does not love Juxian and will \"make a clean break\" with her. Although humiliated, neither Xiaolou or Dieyi are convicted, but must continue to reenact the play for the new government. Juxian is heartbroken and returns the sword to Dieyi before committing suicide. Xiao Si is caught by the Red Guards singing Consort Yu's lines while admiring the lavish stage jewelry he took from Dieyi. In 1977, Dieyi and Xiaolou reunite, seeming to have mended their relationship. They once again practice Farewell My Concubine. During a break, Xiaolou begins reciting the line \"I am by nature a boy,\" to which Dieyi makes the same mistake of finishing with \"I am not a girl.\" As their performance reaches its climax, Dieyi takes Xiaolou's sword to cut his own throat, faithfully paralleling the concubine's final act in the opera. Xiaolou screams Dieyi's name, then softly calls out \"Douzi...\"",

    "film_title": "Frauds (film)",
    "Synopsis": "The film opens with a boy named Roland Copping celebrating his 8th birthday, where his mother gives him a pair of dice that belonged to his father. Roland and his brother Matthew make a raft, and Roland tells Matthew to get on the raft after rolling the dice. Sending it on the river, Matthew jumps onto an overhead crane while the raft goes over a waterfall. Roland runs off to tell his mother, who runs onto the crane and grabs Matthew, but he slips and falls into the river, going over the waterfall. Years later, the now-grown Roland is now an insurance investigator and a practical joker working in the fictional town of Andreas. Jonathan Wheats and his wife, Beth, a kindergarten teacher, host a party involving their friends Margaret and Michael. As a gift, Michael gives Jonathan and Beth two tickets to La Bohème. The next night, while Jonathan is at the opera house, Beth, forgetting about the show as she was supposed to meet Jonathan at the opera house immediately after work, comes home to find the house trashed. She finds a burglar stealing a set of silver Georgian cutlery and trying to escape, and he pursues her with a knife. In defense, Beth fires a crossbow at the burglar, impaling him through the heart. The burglar takes off his mask, revealing himself to be Michael, who was trying to prank her. Beth is held on trial, where the judge rules Michael's death as an accident, and acquits Beth for self-defense. 6 months later, Beth and Jonathan make a phony claim for compensation money for their stolen cutlery. Roland pays a visit to the Wheats' residence and interviews Jonathan about Michael's death. It is revealed that Michael had an accomplice waiting in a getaway car, and after Michael was killed, the accomplice took off. As Roland leaves to process the claims, Jonathan asks if they'll see him again, to which he flips one of the dice and confirms that they will. Jonathan then pulls back the curtain and sees Roland standing across the street, flipping the dice and staring at him. One month later, Roland visits the Wheats again to interview Beth, interrupting a game of Twister, and annoying Beth with his constant rolling of the dice. Roland explains that the dice belonged to his father, who was a war hero, and that they hold a certain magical quality. When Jonathan asks what relevance they hold to the case, Roland flips the dice to decide whether he should continue the conversation tonight or do it tomorrow. When the die lands, he decides to continue the conversation tomorrow, but not before giving them a piece of their stolen forks, and then proclaiming that he will retrieve it tomorrow, as \"new evidence requires a new search\". The next morning, Roland arrives and approves their claim. After going through the steps of the killing, he reveals that Jonathan is the accomplice. Furious and disbelieving him, the Wheats throw him out of the house, but Roland throws a fork at Jonathan, revealing the one he gave them the last night to be a perfect forgery, telling Jonathan he should not have checked his hiding spot. Horrified, Jonathan runs into the shed in the backyard and rips through the hiding spot: a model of the Battle of Austerlitz, only to find the fork is not there. As a shocked Beth follows him inside, Jonathan tells her to close the door, revealing a safe on the back of the door; the safe contains the stolen silver cutlery. Jonathan confesses that he stole the cutlery because Beth spent half of her life surrounded by bills she could not afford. They call Roland and tell him to meet up at their house. He demands money in exchange for his silence, and so they pay him. Instead of telling the police about the fraud, Roland decides to pull childish pranks on them, including taking the set of cutlery, sending an insurance agent to inspect their car, mailing the crossbow used to kill Michael, and decorating a Christmas tree inside their house with the stolen cutlery and the words \"steal me\"; this causes Beth to vomit all over the police detective who arrived at her house to investigate. Meanwhile, Jonathan locates Roland's house and goes inside, accidentally activating a secret passage that takes him into a funhouse-style hideout. He accidentally activates some traps, including one that sets loose Roland's pet goose Cesar. Jonathan prepares to escape just as Roland returns. After discovering Jonathan has been to his hideout, Roland leaves, and Jonathan escapes and follows Roland to a mental asylum called Glendale Clinic, where his brother Matthew is revealed to have survived going over the waterfall, but has become vegetative and quadraplegic. Finally realizing Roland's weakness, Jonathan begs for two days to beat Roland at his game, but Beth is ready to give up and call the police. They give Roland their car, and Beth calls Roland to meet up that night. At Roland's birthday party, Beth surrenders everything she owns in exchange for Roland leaving them alone, but he gives her the dice to roll. Beth snaps and admits that she's had enough of Roland and leaves, secretly stealing his dice. While calling Jonathan at a phone booth, Beth is kidnapped by Roland. Roland calls Jonathan and tells him to arrive at his house, only to find he's already there. Roland threatens to send Beth down a slide into a spinning sawblade, and pulls a gun on Jonathan. Brandishing a phone, Jonathan dials Roland's phone number, revealing he has kidnapped Matthew and tied him up over a pool, and if he calls that number, Matthew will be dropped into the pool and drown. Furious, Roland asks Jonathan how he could do such a thing, as his brother is quadraplegic and mute, but Jonathan reveals that Matthew is actually not vegetative and can speak, as he confessed about their father never wanting to come home, and how he received his permanent injuries while trying to humor his brother. Jonathan gambles that if the die lands on half of the numbers, he and Beth can go free; Roland rolls the die and it lands on one of those numbers. Refusing to accept defeat, Roland fights Jonathan and activates the button, sending Beth down the slide, but the sawblade recedes as she slides over it, crashing into Roland's convertible. In retaliation, Beth dials the number, sending Matthew into the water. Roland dives into the pool to rescue Matthew, but accidentally removes his head, revealing \"Matthew\" to actually be a replica. Roland screams in fury, having finally been defeated. Finally having had enough, Beth calls the police while Jonathan rescues Roland from drowning. As they both look at \"Matthew\"'s floating head, Roland starts to laugh, and Jonathan starts to laugh as the police sirens are heard in the distance. As Beth walks away, she starts to laugh, too.",

    "Synopsis": "<!--NOTE: PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE-LENGTH FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. The current word count is 638.--> Having just crushed an uprising by his half-brother Don John, Don Pedro of Aragon and his noblemen visit their friend Leonato in Messina. Accompanying Don Pedro is the witty Benedick, former acquaintance of Leonato's equally sharp-tongued niece, Beatrice. Also present are Benedick's friend Claudio, a young count; and Don John who, despite his rebellion, has apparently reconciled with his brother. Claudio has been thinking of Leonato's beautiful daughter Hero since before he went to war, and returns to find her as attractive as ever. Don Pedro, learning of his friend's feelings, decides to act on his behalf and arranges the match at a party. An unrepentant Don John attempts to foil it, but unsuccessfully – the match is made. Needing something to pass the time until the wedding, Don Pedro decides to arrange a similar fate for Beatrice and Benedick, who seemingly hate each other. Don Pedro, Leonato, and Claudio stage a conversation containing a false account of how much Beatrice loves Benedick, all the while knowing he is hiding within earshot. Hero and her gentlewomen Ursula and Margaret play the same trick upon Beatrice. Each of them believes the story they hear about the other. Amidst all the good-natured scheming, Don John has been searching for ways to stop the marriage between Claudio and Hero. The night before the wedding, Don John's servant Borachio arranges a steamy liaison with Hero's gentlewoman Margaret at Hero's chamber window. Don John shows Don Pedro and Claudio this, and they believe that they are watching Hero's infidelity. Against the revelry of the evening, the upright but incompetent constable Dogberry appoints a watch to keep the peace. The three hapless watchmen overhear Borachio bragging to his colleague Conrade about how he and Don John had succeeded in stopping the wedding. The watchmen apprehend Borachio and Conrade, and, in the morning, Dogberry attempts to have Leonato interrogate the prisoners. However, a hurried Leonato is unable to decipher what the bumbling Dogberry is trying to tell him. At the wedding, Claudio publicly disgraces his would-be bride and storms away, along with most of the guests, except for Ursula, the Friar, Leonato, Beatrice, Antonio, and Benedick. They all agree to the Friar's plan to publish the tale that Hero, upon the grief of Claudio's accusations, suddenly died. Beatrice and Benedick linger a moment and eventually confess their love to one another. In the wake of this declaration, Beatrice asks Benedick to do the one thing that will satisfy her outrage with what has just happened – kill Claudio. With a heavy heart, he agrees to challenge his friend. Meanwhile, Borachio and Conrade are interrogated by Dogberry and his men. Amidst the confusion, Don John quietly flees. Despite Dogberry's incompetence, the truth of Don John's sinister machinations is revealed. Moments after Benedick's challenge to Claudio, Leonato is made aware of what really happened. Leonato continues to pretend to Claudio that Hero is dead. Claudio entreats him to impose whatever vengeance he sees fit for Claudio's part in Hero's disgrace and death. Leonato forgives Claudio on the condition that he publicly declare his wrongdoing and then marry Hero's cousin - his brother Antonio's daughter - the next morning. He agrees, and carries out the former by reciting an epitaph at Hero's tomb that night. When the bride is brought forth the next day, she is revealed to be none other than Hero herself. She and Claudio profess their true, undying love for each other, as do Beatrice and Benedick, who agree to marry. Benedick renounces his challenge against Claudio and embraces him. Moments later, Don John is marched in, having been captured before he could escape. Benedick advises that Don Pedro forget about him until tomorrow, after the weddings. Those gathered begin to dance, with the two happy couples at the middle. Don Pedro remains behind, still single, but happy for his friends.",

    "Synopsis": "Berthe, an elderly widow, is forced by her declining health to close the French farmhouse where she has spent much of her life. She moves in with her daughter Émilie and son-in-law Bruno, who share a legal practice and have two grown children: Anne, a law student, and Lucien, who was adopted. In spite of Émilie's efforts, Berthe is not happy in her daughter's bourgeois home in Blagnac. She sits by the swimming pool in the middle of the night talking to herself and finds the house pretentious. Worried about her mother's physical and mental health, Émilie pays a visit to her unmarried younger brother, Antoine, a neurosurgeon. They have not seen each other for three years, since they quarreled at their father's funeral. Émilie informs Antoine of their mother's condition and invites him to Christmas dinner with the family. On Christmas Eve, Antoine arrives at his sister's home as Émilie, Bruno and Anne are leaving for midnight mass. Antoine urges himself not to get carried away and spoil the evening. As he wanders through the house looking for his mother, he surprises Lucien, who works at a nightclub in town, making out with Khadija, Émilie and Bruno's Moroccan secretary, who has been invited to spend Christmas with the family. Antoine promises not to tell anything. When he finds his mother's room, Berthe is delighted to see him, but complains about living with Émilie. She dislikes Bruno, has no affection for the grandchildren and does not value Émilie's efforts to put her at ease. Dinner is lively, but after the youngsters leave for Lucien's room, tempers flare between Bruno and Antoine and they exchange blows. Antoine leaves with a bloody nose and Berthe departs with him. Talking later with Bruno, Émilie says she loathes what they have become. Anne is distraught by the family's dispute and looks to Khadija for solace. Berthe returns to live alone at her farm but suffers a stroke. This forces Émilie to visit her brother once again. Antoine has moved to a small apartment in Toulouse. He is glad to learn that Émilie has separated from Bruno. The siblings agree to place their mother in a nursing home. They pick up Berthe and on the drive they remember old times. When Émilie and Antoine sing as they used to when they were children, Berthe cheers up. On a stop during the trip, Antoine fulfills a childhood dream and goes skinny-dipping in a river. Berthe introduces her children to the director of the retirement home. She took good care of her children and they are now two very successful professionals who are too busy to take care of her, she says bitterly. Pressured by her brother, Émilie spends the night at Antoine's apartment. He gives her a drug to help her sleep and joins Khadija and Anne at the bar where Lucien works. Anne has now given up her law studies and works in a music shop. Lucien and Khadija have a rocky relationship. Antoine tries to rekindle the childhood closeness he enjoyed with his sister. When Antoine and Émilie visit their mother at the retirement home, her physical and mental health have greatly deteriorated. She says she wishes she had had a third child because that child would have taken care of her. Émilie and Antoine remove their mother from the nursing home. An exam at the hospital where Antoine works confirms their suspicion that Berthe is in her final decline. Émilie moves back to her house at Blagnac. Antoine breaks into the house to talk to her, and they have an argument. They recriminate each other about their behavior toward their mother. Feeling guilty, Antoine makes a halfhearted attempt to commit suicide, jumping from the balcony of his apartment and breaking a leg. Berthe dies alone at the hospital. After the funeral, Antoine, Émilie, Bruno, Lucien, Anne and Khadija meet at the house in Blagnac and have breakfast outdoors. During the conversation Anne asks the others which is their favorite season since she does not have one. Before Antoine's departure Émilie recites a poem she learned as a song as a child. She used to sing it while waiting at school for the holidays to be reunited with Antoine.",

    "Synopsis": "In a Manchester alley, Johnny is having sex with a woman, who initially encourages him but then protests that he is hurting her, pushes him away, and runs off vowing that \"her Bernard\" will get vengeance on him for this. Johnny grabs his things from his apartment, steals a car, and flees to Dalston, a \"scrawny, unpretentious area\" in east London. He seeks refuge at the home of Louise, a former girlfriend from Manchester, who is not happy to see him. Louise works as a file clerk and lives with two flatmates, the unemployed Sophie, whom she calls her \"hippy-dippy friend\", and the primary tenant Sandra, a nurse who is away in Zimbabwe. Johnny seduces Sophie while treating Louise coldly, but soon tires of her. He leaves and walks around central London, expounding his world view at length to anyone who will listen. Among the people he meets are Archie, a young Scottish man looking for his girlfriend Maggie on Brewer Street, and Brian, a security guard who looks after an empty office building at night, which Johnny calls \"the most tedious job in England\", while planning to move to a seaside cottage in the future. After pursuing a drunk woman and rejecting her when he notices a skull and crossbones tattoo on her shoulder, Johnny follows a young cafe worker home but she grows upset and throws him out. He hitches a ride with a man hanging posters around town until the man, exasperated by Johnny's nonstop haranguing, knees him in the balls and, once Johnny is curled on the pavement, kicks him again before driving off with Johnny's duffel bag containing his clothes and books. Johnny wanders the streets and is severely beaten by a wandering gang of thugs. Meanwhile at Louise's residence, the landlord Jeremy (aka Sebastian), a psychopathic and amoral yuppie and rapist, lets himself in, rapes Sophie, and tosses several hundred pounds at her for \"services rendered\". Louise returns, realizes that Sophie is traumatised and vainly tries to get Jeremy out of the house. When Johnny, in awful shape, reaches the house, the two women try to keep him quiet, but he has a fit that wakes the sleeping Jeremy. Sandra returns early from her trip. Though horrified by the state of the apartment, she tends to Johnny's injuries. Jeremy departs. Johnny makes it clear that he has no time for Sophie who, desolate and rejected, flees the house with her few possessions. Louise and Johnny seemingly reconcile and discuss returning to Manchester together, but once she leaves for work, Johnny steals the money Jeremy tossed at Sophie and hobbles out into the streets.",

    "Synopsis": "England is in an economic recession with crushing unemployment. Bob and his best friend Tommy try all sorts of schemes to make money including stealing sheep to sell to local butchers, tearing up turf from government buildings to re-sell and cleaning out bathroom pipes. Bob's wife Anne tries to help but lacks marketable skills (she is let go by a seamstress factory for not knowing how to sew). Despite their best efforts, both men cannot make any job stick or reduce their debts. Despite his family's tenuous financial condition, Bob plans to buy a new outfit for his daughter Coleen's First Communion, though this is prohibitively costly. Eventually, Bob secretly gets a loan to pay for Coleen's outfit and party. He cannot repay the money, so the lender sells the debt to a vicious loan shark, who forces his way into Bob's house while Bob is out, steals Anne's jewelry and makes numerous threats that he will injure Coleen if he's not paid soon. When Bob gets home, he's outraged at the trauma the loan shark inflicted on his family. He confronts the loan shark at a parking garage outside of a bar. The loan shark beats up Bob and threatens to do even worse. However, as the loan shark begins driving off, Bob smashes his windscreen with a wrench and causes the car to lose control and smash into a column, killing the loan shark. Bob grabs the notebook with all delinquent accounts from the loan shark's pocket and flees. Bob runs to a nearby church, where he tells the priest what happened and vows to turn himself in to police. The kindhearted priest tells Bob not to turn himself in, noting that Bob didn't kill the loan shark and that many neighbourhood folks are now relieved. He tells Bob to pray for the loan shark's rotten soul and burns the ledger. The next day, Bob attends Communion as Coleen is adorable in her new outfit. Despite the occasion, he appears withdrawn and nervous, still feeling guilty about what he's done.",

    "film_title": "Splitting Heirs",
    "Synopsis": "The film centers on the aristocratic family of the Dukes of Bournemouth, upon which misfortune has fallen throughout history, leading its members to believe that the family is cursed. The most recent heir, Thomas Henry Butterfly Rainbow Peace, was left in a restaurant as an infant in the 1960s; by the time his parents remembered him, he had disappeared. Meanwhile, in the 1990s Tommy Patel has grown up in an Asian/Indian family in Southall, never doubting his ethnicity despite being taller than anyone else in the house, fair-haired, blue-eyed, light-skinned—and not liking curry. From the family corner shop he commutes to the City where he works for the Bournemouth family's stockbroking firm, handling multimillion-pound deals. Tommy is given the job of acting as host to the visiting American representative of the firm, Henry Bullock, who turns out to be the son of the head of the firm, the present Duke. They become friends and the friendship survives Henry becoming the new Duke when his father dies. Circumstantial evidence shows that the true Bournemouth heir is actually Tommy; we see a series of family portraits each of which captures something of Tommy's facial characteristics, and his Indian mother tells him the story of his adoption. He consults the lawyer who dealt with his adoption, Raoul P. Shadgrind, who says Tommy has no hope of proving his claim, but plants the idea of him obtaining his rightful place in the family by getting Henry out of the way; Shadgrind himself then engineers a variety of 'accidents' in the belief that he will share in the spoils as Tommy's partner. Love interest is provided by Tommy's and Henry's (shared at the same time) lover, later the new Duchess and their (shared at different times) mother, the dowager Duchess. The final resolution of everyone's doubts and misconceptions leaves everyone living \"happily ever after – \"well, for a bit, at least...\"",

    "Synopsis": "Sicily, 1990s. Following the killing of the deputy prosecutor Rizzo and the carabinieri marshal Virzì, the magistrate Michele De Francesco arrives in Trapani. His escort consists of Angelo, native of the place, a friend of the slain marshal and determined to do justice; of Andrea, head of the Trapani escort; of Fabio, a Roman who does not accept the risky assignment, and the two drivers, Raffaele and Nicola. Soon the magistrate, investigating the water supply of the city and the construction of a large dam, discovers dangerous collusions between the mafia, politics and law enforcement, in the persons of the M.P. Nestore Bonura, the deputy prefect Scavone and the boss Mazzaria. The decision to close the wells that supply the city causes a scandal to which De Francesco decides to take shelter, giving the men of the escort powers and prerogatives that effectively deprive the staff of the Prosecutor's Office, of which the ambiguous Polizzi seems the probable mole. After initial disagreements between Angelo and Andrea, an increasingly intense friendship arises between the men in the escort, in the midst of a daily odyssey made up of exhausting telephone checks, risky car journeys, threats. The judge's daughter, who arrived in Trapani to celebrate her birthday with her father, miraculously escapes a bomb attack on the car in which she had to travel. Thus dies the driver Raffaele. The pursuit of the investigation also leads to the killing, by the Cosa Nostra, of Bonura, now gripped by overwhelming evidence, despite the silence of a colleague and friend of De Francesco, judge Barresi of Caltanissetta. Worthless is the anger of the escort men who, now in tune with the magistrate, decide, despite everything, to stay by his side, including Fabio who would even give up the long waited transfer. However, an order of the judiciary transfers the judge accusing him of having used the escort beyond his specific duties, of having disturbed public order and offended the prestige of the Prosecutor's staff. Forced by the events De Francesco embarks for the mainland greeted by the men of his escort who have never betrayed him.",

    "film_title": "The Piano",
    "Synopsis": "In the mid-1800s, Ada McGrath, a Scottish woman with elective mutism, travels to colonial New Zealand with her daughter Flora for an arranged marriage to settler Alisdair Stewart. Ada has not spoken since the age of six, and the reason for this as well as the identity of Flora's father remain unknown. She communicates through playing the piano and sign language, with Flora acting as her interpreter. Ada and Flora, along with their handcrafted piano, are stranded on a New Zealand beach by a ship's crew. The next day, Alisdair arrives with his Māori crew and neighbour George Baines, a retired sailor who has adapted to Maori customs, including facial tattoos. Alisdair tells Ada that they do not have enough bearers for the piano and then refuses to go back for it, claiming that they all need to make sacrifices. Desperate to retrieve her piano, Ada seeks George's help. While at first saying no, he appears to give in due to her keenness on recovering the piano. Once at the beach, he is entranced by her music and appears charmed by her happy ways when she is playing, in contrast to her stern behaviour when in the farm. George offers Alisdair the land he has been coveting in exchange for the piano and lessons from Ada. Alisdair agrees, oblivious to George's attraction to Ada. Ada is enraged by George's proposition but agrees to trade lessons for piano keys. She restricts the lessons to the black keys only and resists George's demands for more intimacy. Ada continues to rebuff Alisdair's advances while exploring her sensuality with George. George eventually realizes that Ada will never commit to him emotionally and returns the piano to her, confessing that he wants Ada to care for him genuinely. Although Ada has her piano back, she longs for George and returns to him. Alisdair overhears them having sex and watches them through a crack in the wall. Furious, he confronts Ada and tries to force himself on her despite her strong resistance. He then coerces Ada into promising she will no longer see George. Shortly after, Ada instructs Flora to deliver a package to George, which contains a piano key with a love declaration engraved on it. Flora delivers it to Alisdair instead. Enraged after reading the message, Alisdair cuts off Ada's index finger, depriving her of the ability to play the piano. He sends Flora to George with the severed finger, warning him to stay away from Ada or he will chop off more fingers. Later, while touching Ada as she sleeps, Alisdair hears what he thinks is her voice in his head, asking him to let George take her away. He goes to George's house and asks if Ada has ever spoken to him, but George says no. George and Ada leave together with her belongings and piano tied onto a Māori canoe. As they row to the ship, Ada asks George to throw the piano overboard. She allows her leg to be caught by the rope attached to the piano and is dragged underwater with it in an attempt to drown herself. As she sinks, she appears to change her mind and struggles free before being pulled to safety. In the epilogue, Ada describes her new life with George and Flora in Nelson, where she gives piano lessons in their new home. George has made her a metal finger to replace the one she lost, and Ada has been practicing and taking speech lessons. She sometimes dreams of the piano resting at the bottom of the ocean with her still tethered to it.",

    "film_title": "A Confucian Confusion",
    "Synopsis": "In 1994 Taipei, Molly is engaged to Akeem, the son of a wealthy family. Wishing for something to occupy her and prodded by his friend and auditor Larry as part of his plan to force her to marry him, Akeem gives her a small entertainment company to manage. The company has two current projects - 1) a weekly TV talk show about finding happiness in life, hosted by Molly’s sister and 2) a play by Molly’s friend Birdy, who stole the idea for it from an old, pulpy romantic bestseller by Molly’s brother-in-law (“the author” henceforth). He has since moved into an apartment alone to write darker, more pessimistic, and commercially unviable works, and their marriage has consequently deteriorated. To quiet accusations of infringement of intellectual property rights, Molly asks her secretary and confidant Qiqi to obtain permission from the author, but a busy Qiqi asks new employee Feng to take care of it. Meanwhile, Molly’s sister asks Molly about rumors of her having an affair with Birdy behind Akeem’s back, as he is vacationing in mainland China; Molly dismiss them and downplay their ramifications. Feng returns to tell Qiqi that she was thrown out by the author, so Qiqi agrees to take over the matter. Qiqi’s boyfriend, Ming, is a promising young bureaucrat. That day, he learns from his colleague Liren that he is being harassed by a contractor who finished a project late and wants him to write off those days as weather-related delays. Larry arrives at the company to conduct an audit, which reflects poorly on the company’s financial condition. During it, Larry receives a call from Akeem, who has returned from the mainland ahead of schedule. As Larry leaves, a frustrated Molly fires Feng on a whim. Qiqi knows she aspires to an acting career and suggests that she auditions for Birdy’s play the next day. Molly receives a call from Akeem and delays meeting him until breakfast the next morning. Larry meets Akeem, who claims to be blasé about the rumors but is secretly distraught. Right afterwards, Larry meets up with Molly to spend the evening. Concurrently, Ming and Liren have just gotten off work and walking past a restaurant, see Qiqi and Feng. Liren enters to flirt with Feng while Qiqi leaves with Ming because they are having dinner with his father and aunt. During the meal, Ming’s father and aunt introduce Qiqi to the former's friend, with whom she will be working should she accept the new public relations job that his aunt has found for her. Ming, though cynical about his aunt’s intentions and not close to his father, persuades her to accept the more lucrative and adventurous offer and leave Molly because he had a confrontation with her and Qiqi frequently complains about having to clean up after Molly, but she is reluctant to part with her on account of their friendship. Meanwhile, Larry accuses Molly of insulting his integrity by asking him whether his relationship with Feng is an amorous one, so Molly kicks him out. Larry goes to a bar where Akeem is drunkenly yelling out for Molly, calms him down, and reveals the next part of his plan - now that Molly’s company is in shambles, he can reclaim ownership of the company and, by extension, Molly. Larry, who has designs on Molly, also promises to help Akeem identify her secret lover. Molly meets up with Qiqi and she confesses her anxiety over people thinking she fakes her cheerfulness and dismay that Molly seems to be withholding more and more from her. Upon returning home, Ming’s mother tells him that Liren is at a bar. On the way there, he meets the contractor, who wants him to sympathize with his situation. At the bar, Ming convinces Liren to forge the documents. Outside it, he and Feng walk to her home, him spilling his guts about the disappointment of his relationship with Qiqi. Feng claims her roommate will not be back until very late and intimates sex, but upon seeing Larry, puts him on a taxi home, for her roommate is her boyfriend, Larry. Feng presses Larry about his relationship with Molly and he denies pursuing her. Over breakfast, Akeem agrees to continue funding the company in the hope that some love will blossom between them once it becomes successful. Qiqi meets the author, who is indifferent to the plagiarism of works he now disowns and accuses her of putting on a cheerful appearance. Molly meets Ming for lunch, where she reveals that her sister was betrothed to Akeem but fell in love with the author, so Akeem’s father picked Molly as her replacement, and he discloses Qiqi’s offer and reluctance to tell Molly about it, news that she appears to be happy about and supportive of but is devastated by. Returning to the company, Qiqi tells Molly that her sister is waiting for her at the studio; she confronts her about what Ming said and leaves. Larry meets Akeem and fingers Birdy. At the studio, Molly’s sister and Birdy have just finished filming their episode when Akeem arrives and attacks him, infuriating Molly. Outside Ming’s workplace, Qiqi confronts him about his revelation to Molly, to which he asks her to choose between him and Molly. Returning to his office, he learns that Liren has been fired for forgery. Feng visits the set and catches Birdy’s eye. Qiqi visits the author again and confides in him about her troubles. He shows her some of his new work, including A Confucian Confusion, a veiled autobiographical novel about the reincarnation of Confucius in a modern world that abides by his teachings and his realization that people think he is a charlatan and his popularity is due to people’s interest in learning how to become a successful one like him. While reading his new work, Molly’s sister arrives and after Qiqi leaves, tries to convince him to return. After trading blows over her optimistic show and his pessimistic work, she assures him that she will always wait for him. A shaken Ming goes to visit his dad but leaves before his aunt can fetch him; his dad throws a tantrum as a result. While making out with Feng on-set after hours, Birdy is interrupted by the arrival of the script girl, then gets a call that he expected to be from Akeem, but it is from Molly, who is waiting outside in her car. On their drive, he swears retribution against Akeem’s attack. Meanwhile, Feng receives the call from Akeem, who is waiting with Larry outside. Arguing that this may be a sex plot designed by Birdy, Larry decides to go upstairs instead of Akeem to meet Birdy. Right then, Molly and Birdy pull up. Seeing their argument, Akeem realizes that they could not possibly be having an affair. Akeem tells Birdy about Larry and he goes up while the former stays with his car. Moments later, he decides to go upstairs too and after running into Feng in the elevator, finds Larry chasing Birdy with a sword prop. Dismayed that he identified the wrong lover and is being restrained by Akeem, Larry decries that his commitment to their friendship has not been reciprocated; Akeem responds by putting him in an elevator. Wandering the set, Akeem meets the script girl. Outside his house, Ming finds Molly distraught over her falling out with Qiqi; he comforts her and they spend the night. Meanwhile, Qiqi arrives at the author’s place, where he tells her that just as he was about to commit suicide, her face appeared in his mind and she is his only reason for continuing to live. Qiqi leaves when he assumes that she views him similarly and he chases down her taxi. After conversing with the driver, the author realizes that the way to fight the hypocrisy he sees in the modern world is not with death, as he proposes in his recent work, but by living honestly, and walks away. After sex, Molly begs Ming to tell her that he loves her, and when he refuses to lie, she leaves. Qiqi arrives at the company to find Molly there alone and they reconcile. Akeem arrives to call off the engagement, stating that he does not want to risk having a relationship like Molly’s sister’s, where both parties pretend to be in love, and has fallen in love with someone else (implied to be the script girl). Molly agrees, on the condition that he reclaims the company, which he gladly accepts, since the script girl is also in entertainment. At home, Qiqi receives a phone call that Ming’s father is in an ICU after excessive drinking over missing Ming the previous night; he survives. In the hospital’s elevator, Ming and Qiqi amicably break up and promise to stay in touch, with Ming suggesting that maybe they can get coffee sometime. Qiqi walks towards the exit while Ming returns to the elevator to go back upstairs to his dad. However, he hesitates and instead presses the “open” button and, to his surprise, finds Qiqi standing right outside. She asks if he feels like having that cup of coffee and he hugs her.",

    "film_title": "An Unforgettable Summer",
    "Synopsis": "The film's plot, which develops as a flashback narrated by Dumitriu's young son, opens with what American film magazine Variety called \"a mad gallop, with the camera in the saddle, giving viewers a crash course in regional rivalries circa 1925.\" The two persons are the short and monocled Captain Dumitriu and his sophisticated wife. Confronted with the general's spiteful decision, they find themselves isolated to a garrison in a land frequently raided by Macedonian komitadji, in rebellion against Romanian rule. Initially shocked by the cultural clash, Von Debretsy, a mother of three, attempts to adapt her aristocratic lifestyle to the new requirements, but manages to make herself stand out when she continues to seek a life of luxury. French critic Sylvie Rollet argues that this attempt to \"tame the world\" by erecting \"frontiers\" is a central aspect of An Unforgettable Summer. While Petre Dumitriu is motivated by his pursuit of discipline, his wife preserves her sophistication, reading the works of Marcel Proust, playing the harpsichord, employing a nanny to educate her children, and comparing the surrounding landscape with Japan's Mount Fuji. Variety calls her \"sensitive-yet-flamboyant in the mold of Zelda Fitzgerald\". To her husband's assurance that they were not going to spend long in Southern Dobruja, she replies: \"I like it here.\" In pursuing this path, she only manages to widen the gap between her and most other characters. This rift is made apparent by a number of omens: unknown attackers throw rocks into the Dumitrius' house, while the vegetables she planted in the garden prove unpalatable. Confronted with these signs, Von Debretsy still attempts to make the best of the situation; online film critic James Berardinelli notes: \"[She] does her best to make a happy home for her family, despite stray bullets that shatter mirrors.\" Bulgarian locals, taken as hostages by the military, are made to work on the garden. Their labor brings immediate improvement to the crop, and, upset by their condition, Marie-Thérèse decides to pay them out of her own pocket, serves them tea and eventually befriends them. In a scene that provided the original title for Petru Dumitriu's book chapter (\"The Salad\"), she invites Ipsilanti and other officers to dinner, and they are all shown to be enjoying the salad provided by Bulgarian labor. However, the episode also renews tensions between Ipsilanti and his Hungarian host, when she expresses her appreciation of her servants' work and attempts to intervene on their behalf. As a result of one Macedonian incursion, during which border guards are killed, Dumitriu is ordered to round up and execute a number of his Bulgarian prisoners. Horrified by this random reprisal, Marie-Thérèse strives to have them pardoned and released, but her plea only serves to irritate her husband's superiors. Her husband alienates his superiors further when he asks for the execution order to be ratified through official channels, whereas they would prefer an extrajudicial killing. The resulting toll on Dumitriu's career means that they are forced to leave Southern Dobruja, shortly before which the captain's colleagues make public their resentment of the couple. The captain feels dishonored when an angry General Tchilibia draws a comparison between Von Debretsy and the prostitute Erzsi and stresses that, as Hungarians, both women are natural suspects in Romania. It is a result of this that Dumitriu decides to commit suicide, unable to decide whether to shoot himself in the mouth or in the temple, but is ultimately unable to do so and begins to weep uncontrollably. This episode, Simon points out, was not present in the original text, and was invented by Pintilie to underline the degradation his character undergoes in order to survive. In what is one of the closing scenes, Marie-Thérèse is nearly stoned by the Bulgarian women whose husbands had been executed.",

The film cuts to Komdiv Sergei Petrovich Kotov, his wife Maroussia, and their young six-year-old daughter Nadia relaxing in a banya when a peasant from the local collective farm frantically tells them the Red Army's tanks are about to crush the wheat harvest as part of general maneuvers. After hearing this news, Kotov rides out to order the tank officer to halt. Kotov carries authority as a senior Old Bolshevik and legendary hero of the 1917 Russian Civil War, and he is also very popular with the common people and local villagers. The opening scene makes it clear that Kotov is a devoted family man, and he claims to be a personal friend of Stalin. Following this incident, the happy family returns to their country dacha (country estate), where they join Maroussia's relatives, a large and eccentric family of Chekhovian aristocrats. Mitya (Dmitri), who had been Maroussia's fiancé before disappearing in 1927, arrives in a costume to disguise himself, but when he takes it off he is joyfully embraced by the family and introduced to Nadia as \"Uncle Mitya\". Maroussia is left feeling deeply conflicted, as she had suffered deeply when Mitya left without explanation and even contemplated suicide, as shown by the self-inflicted marks on her wrists. Despite his personable nature, it is clear that Mitya has returned with a secret agenda. It is slowly revealed throughout the duration of the afternoon that he works for the Soviet political police, the NKVD, and has arrived to arrest Kotov for a non-existent conspiracy that Mitya had framed him for. Mitya is abusing his power for the purpose of revenge, since ten years ago Kotov had conscripted Mitya into the OGPU, the predecessor of the NKVD, and was therefore the reason for Mitya being taken away. Mitya detests Kotov, whom he blames for causing him to lose Maroussia, his love for Russia, faith, and his profession as a pianist. Kotov confronts Mitya about his activities in Paris, where he gave up eight White Army generals to the NKVD. All were kidnapped, smuggled to the Soviet Union, and shot dead without trial. Although eventually realizing that Mitya intends to take him away, Kotov believes that his close relationship with Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin will save him. However, a black car carrying NKVD agents arrives to remove Kotov, just as a group of Young Pioneer children arrives at the dacha to pay tribute to him. Kotov willingly goes with Mitya, pretending to be Mitya's friend and even lets Nadia briefly ride in the car with them. While riding away in the car with his captors, Kotov reminds them who he is and his status, but he quickly realizes that they don't care and that it was Stalin himself who ordered his arrest. Only after looking into Mitya's eyes does Kotov realize the severity of the situation, causing him to breakdown in tears. Kotov is forced to make a false confession to all the charges Mitya framed him for and is shot dead in August 1936. Meanwhile, following Mitya's success in his revenge against Kotov, he ultimately commits suicide, as his revenge did not satisfy him in the way he thought it would. In addition, Maroussia is arrested and dies in the Gulag in 1940. Although arrested with her mother and taken to a concentration camp, Nadia lives to see all three sentences overturned during the Khrushchev thaw, in 1956, and works as a music teacher in Kazakhstan.",

    "Synopsis": "Putting the hot Roman summer to good use, Nanni Moretti dedicates himself to his favorite hobby, riding his Vespa through the streets of the half-deserted city. Here, Moretti lets the landscape inspire his thoughts: he laments the banalization of politics in contemporary Italian cinema, comments on the gentrification of the quarters of Rome, mocks the overzealous critical reception of movies like Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, and confesses his love for dance caused by the movie Flashdance – later meeting its star Jennifer Beals. Finally, he visits the place in Ostia where Pier Paolo Pasolini was killed, to pay his respects. Having to work on an idea for a new movie, Moretti decides to leave Rome for a while for the more peaceful Aeolian Islands. In Lipari he's the guest of his friend Gerardo, an austere scholar who moved there eleven years earlier to better study James Joyce's Ulysses without being distracted by modern commodities such as television, which he despises. However, both are unable to find the tranquility they're searching for since the number of tourists has suddenly increased. They move to Salina, where they are guests of two couples friends of Gerardo, both incapable of managing their hyperactive children, a feature that seems rampant on the entire island. Meanwhile, Gerardo begins watching television and gradually becomes completely addicted to it, and especially to soap operas. They move again, this time to Stromboli, where they are constantly bothered by a megalomaniac mayor who tries to involve them in the oddest projects. They finally move to Alicudi, frugal and isolated, lacking water and electricity. Here Moretti seems to have found the right place to focus on his project, but soon Gerardo runs away in despair to catch the last ferry, unable to live without his favorite soap operas, while disavowing his ideals and proclaiming undying love for cheap entertainment. Moretti clarifies to the audience that the following chapter will be based on a true story happened to him some years earlier; one day, he begins to suffer from persistent itching and insomnia. He visits many doctors and specialists, but they all dismiss him with different diagnosis, prescribing a lot of costly drugs and prohibiting him to eat most of his favorite food. Seeing no improvements, Moretti unsuccessfully tries alternative cures like reflexology and acupuncture. After almost a year, a doctor notices his developing cough during a visit and suggests him an X-ray. That reveals a mass on his lung, which after a biopsy is discovered to be a still-curable Hodgkin's lymphoma. Moretti successfully goes through chemotherapy and has the lymphoma cured. Sometime later, he reads the definition of Hodgkin's lymphoma in a basic medical encyclopedia, finding out that its most common symptoms are exactly itching and insomnia. Surrounded by the dozens of useless drugs he bought, Moretti laments the incapability of most doctors of listening to their patients, before making a bitter toast \"to health\" with a glass of water.",

    "Synopsis": "Francis Brown, a tax auditor for Revenue Canada, is a regular visitor to a Toronto strip club called Exotica. He always has Christina, an exotic dancer dressed in a schoolgirl uniform, give him a private dance. This inspires the jealousy of the club's DJ, Eric, Christina's former boyfriend who has also impregnated the club's owner, Zoe. While at the club, Francis pays his brother Harold's teenage daughter, Tracey, to \"babysit\". However, Francis has no children and the girl merely practices music alone on his piano until Francis returns and drives her home. Francis' relationship with Harold is strained, as Francis learned that Harold and Francis' wife had been having an affair before she died in a car accident that left Harold a paraplegic. Francis' daughter, Lisa, had been kidnapped and murdered a few months before the accident, and he was one of the suspects but was later exonerated. These events have left a huge psychological scar on Francis. In his professional life, Francis is sent to audit an exotic pet store owned and operated by Thomas Pinto, an introverted gay man profiting from the illegal import of a rare bird species. Thomas has been smuggling hyacinth macaw eggs, and his operation has afforded him hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, spurring suspicion from Canadian authorities. Francis soon discovers these illegal activities in Thomas' financial records. Francis is eventually banned from Exotica when Eric manipulates him into touching Christina during one of her dances, violating the club's rules. Having realized that Eric intentionally set out to get Francis banned from the club, he vows to murder him. Armed with the knowledge of Thomas's tax evasion, Francis blackmails Thomas into visiting Exotica, and instructs him to touch Christina during one of her dances, so that Thomas too will be thrown out of the club; Francis intends to use this as an opportunity to infiltrate the club and murder Eric. Francis affixes Thomas with a wiretap so that he can listen in on Thomas's visit to Exotica. While Christina gives Thomas a lap dance, he attempts to glean information from her, and the two have a conversation which Francis listens to from his parked car. Christina explains to Thomas that she and Francis share a relationship of mutual dependency, and reveals to Thomas personal details about Francis's life, specifically his daughter's murder. A distraught Francis exits his car and waits for Eric outside the club. Confronting Eric with a gun, Francis is defused when Eric reveals he and Christina, who met each other while volunteering in a search party for the missing Lisa, were the ones who discovered Lisa's dead body. Francis embraces Eric. In a flashback, Francis drives a teenage Christina—who, at that time, worked for Francis and his wife as Lisa's babysitter—to her parents' home. During these routine drives, Francis would often comfort Christina over her troubled home life. As Francis drops Christina off at her house, he assures her that she can always confide in him.",

    "film_title": "Pulp Fiction",
    "Synopsis": "The film is presented in a nonlinear narrative structure as explained above. The following is a linear summary of the film's plot. A young Butch Coolidge is visited by Captain Koons, an Air Force pilot. Koons reveals a gold watch to Butch and explains that the watch is a family heirloom and belonged to Butch's father, who served with Koons and died in a POW camp in the Vietnam War. Koons hands the watch down to Butch. In the present time, two hitmen, Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega, drive to an apartment to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, Los Angeles gangster Marsellus Wallace, from a dishonest business partner, Brett. On the way, Vincent mentions that he has been tasked by Marsellus to take his wife, Mia Wallace, to dinner that night. They enter the apartment, finding the briefcase, Brett, and an informant for Marsellus named Marvin. Jules recites a fictional passage from the Book of Ezekiel before he and Vincent kill Brett. Immediately afterward another man bursts out of the bathroom and fires at them. The two are inexplicably uninjured and kill the man, leaving with Marvin. While driving, Vincent accidentally shoots Marvin in the head, covering the two and the car's interior in blood. They hide the car at the home of Jules' friend Jimmie, who demands they deal with Marvin's corpse and the blood-stained car before his wife, Bonnie, comes home. Marsellus sends a cleaner, Winston Wolfe, who directs Jules and Vincent to hide the body in the trunk, clean the car, dispose of their bloody clothes and take the car to a junkyard. When the car and clothes have been rid of, Jules and Vincent eat breakfast at a diner. Jules tells Vincent that he plans to retire from his life of crime, convinced that their survival at the apartment was divine intervention. Vincent does not believe that their survival was anything more than peculiar. At the same time, a pair of thieves, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny, are seated nearby and preparing to rob the diner. When Vincent is in the bathroom, they begin the robbery and demand Marsellus' briefcase from Jules. Jules overpowers Pumpkin and holds him at gunpoint, causing Honey Bunny to become hysterical. She points her gun at Jules and Vincent returns and points his gun at her. Jules defuses the situation, allowing the two to keep the money in his wallet and letting them leave. Jules and Vincent leave shortly afterwards with the briefcase. Jules and Vincent go with the briefcase to visit Marsellus in a bar. At the bar, Marsellus bribes an aging Butch to intentionally lose in his upcoming boxing match. That night, Vincent purchases heroin from his drug dealer, Lance. He shoots up and drives to meet Mia at her house. They eat at a 1950s-themed restaurant and participate in a twist contest, then return home. While Vincent is in the bathroom, Mia finds his heroin, mistakes it for cocaine, and snorts it. She passes out from an overdose, and Vincent rushes her to Lance's house, where they revive her by injecting her heart with adrenaline. Vincent and Mia agree never to tell Marsellus about the incident. Butch double-crosses Marsellus by killing his opponent. He plans to flee with his girlfriend, Fabienne, but discovers that she has forgotten to pack the gold watch. Returning to his apartment to retrieve it, he notices a MAC-10 submachine gun on the kitchen counter and hears the toilet flush. Vincent, who had been staking out Butch's apartment, emerges from the bathroom. Butch kills him with the gun and leaves. While returning to the motel he sees Marsellus crossing the road. Marsellus chases Butch into a pawnshop. Maynard, the shop owner, captures them at gunpoint and gags them in the basement. Maynard and his accomplice, Zed, take Marsellus into another room and rape him. Butch breaks free from his restraints and kills Maynard with a katana, freeing Marsellus. Marsellus tells Butch that he has been forgiven and instructs him to tell no one about the incident, and to depart Los Angeles forever. Butch picks up Fabienne on Zed's chopper and they ride off.",

    "Synopsis": "During the late 16th century, Catholics and Protestant Huguenots are fighting over political control of France, which is ruled by the neurotic, hypochondriac King Charles IX, and his mother, Catherine de' Medici, a scheming power player. Catherine decides to make an overture of goodwill by offering up her daughter Margot in marriage to Henri de Bourbon, a prominent Huguenot and King of Navarre. She wants to diplomatically spare the sensibilities of Pope Gregory XIII and Spain on the one hand, and the Protestant states on the other, and above all appease the hatred and rivalries within the kingdom between the Catholic party of Duke Henri de Guise (Miguel Bosé) and the Protestant faction led by Admiral Gaspard de Coligny (Jean-Claude Brialy). Soon after, she schemes to bring about the notorious St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre of 1572, when thousands of Protestants are slaughtered. The marriage goes forward but Margot, who does not love Henri, begins a passionate affair with the soldier La Môle, also a Protestant from a well-to-do family. Murders by poisoning follow, as court intrigues multiply and Queen Catherine's villainous plotting to place her son the Duke of Anjou on the throne threatens the lives of La Môle, Margot and Henri of Navarre. A book with pages painted with arsenic is intended for Henri but instead causes the slow, agonizing death of King Charles. Henri escapes to Navarre and sends La Môle to fetch Margot, but Guise apprehends him. La Môle is beheaded in the Bastille before Margot can save him, and King Charles finally dies. Margot escapes carrying La Môle's embalmed head as Anjou is proclaimed King of France as Henry III.",

For a generation of children, the rice comes not from the ground, but from a sack, offloaded from the back of a United Nations relief truck. So it is in these uncertain times, that a Cambodian family is attempting to grow rice. The father, Pouev, is concerned that the family's plot of land is shrinking, and he might not be able to grow a big enough crop. The mother, Om, is worried for her husband, and her worst fears are confirmed when Poeuv steps on a poisonous thorn, and then, after a protracted period of being bedridden, dies of infection. Om is unable to handle the pressure of being the head of the family, nor does she have the strength to tend to the rice fields. She turns to alcohol and gambling and is eventually locked up for her mental illness. Responsibility for bringing in the crop and raising her six sisters falls on the oldest girl, Sakha.",

    "Synopsis": "Andrew Crocker-Harris is a veteran teacher of Greek and Latin at a British public school. After nearly 20 years of service, he is being forced to retire on the pretext of his health, and perhaps may not even be given a pension. He is disliked or ignored by the other teachers and while his pupils fear his relentlessly strict discipline, they are bored by his dictatorial but dreary and uninspiring teaching methods. His younger wife Laura, whom he has sexually and emotionally neglected, is unfaithful, and now lives to wound him any way she can. She is having an affair with Frank, an eager, young American science teacher who is highly popular with his pupils, much more lenient with classroom rules yet is able to connect with the pupils. In his final class, Andrew, while reading from a Greek play, finally shows some genuine passion about the subject, giving a glimpse at the teacher he could have been. Andrew's nervous new replacement Tom expresses his awe at the ironclad control that the former exerts over his classes, but Andrew advises his young colleague not to follow his example. As his retirement at the end of the school term draws near, Andrew is approached by a quiet and sensitive pupil named Taplow who has detected the unhappiness and loneliness of his teacher and makes an attempt to reach out to him, saying that Andrew's Latin teachings have inspired him. Taplow gives Andrew a gift – a rare copy of an early edition of the 'Browning Version' – the 1877 translation by Robert Browning of Aeschylus' ancient play Agamemnon. Touched by this gesture, Andrew's emotional guard begins to be let down for the first time. Increasingly aware of Andrew's isolation, Frank feels guilty about the affair with Laura and ends the relationship. Shortly before the end-of-term school assembly in which Andrew will make his farewell speech, Laura tells her husband that she wants their marriage to end and that she intends to leave him. The school's senior staff want Andrew to make his speech first, to be followed by the farewell speech of a younger, more popular teacher who is leaving to pursue a career as a cricketer. But Andrew insists on going second, even though the headmaster angrily says that it will give the ceremony an 'anti-climax'. To the surprise of everyone, including Laura who has lingered to watch the event, Andrew's speech is highly emotional and revelatory, apologising for his failures both as a teacher and as a person. Moved by the speech, the pupils and staff give Andrew a huge applause. Andrew, as a parting gesture of gratitude, tells Taplow that he has organised a place for him in Frank's science class which the pupil had been eager to join. Laura has a newfound sense of respect for her husband and the two part on good terms. As he watches Laura drive away, Andrew sadly but calmly faces the next phase of his life.",

    "film_title": "The Hudsucker Proxy",
    "Synopsis": "In December 1958, Norville Barnes, a business college graduate from Muncie, Indiana, arrives in New York City, looking for a job. He struggles due to lack of experience and becomes a mailroom clerk at Hudsucker Industries, a large corporation. Soon thereafter, the company's founder and president, Waring Hudsucker, unexpectedly commits suicide during a business meeting by jumping out of a top-floor window. Afterward, Sidney J. Mussburger, a ruthless member of the company's board of directors, knowing that Hudsucker Industries' bylaws call for Hudsucker's stock shares to be sold to the public, suggests a scheme to buy the controlling interest in the company by temporarily depressing the stock price by hiring a clearly incompetent president to run the business. In the mailroom, Norville is assigned to deliver a \"Blue Letter\" to Mussburger. The letter is a top-secret communication from Hudsucker, sent shortly before his death. However, Norville does not deliver the letter; instead, he pitches Mussburger an invention of his (indicated with no other explanation than a simple drawing of a circle and his cryptic explanation, \"you know: for kids\"). Believing Norville to be an idiot, Mussburger selects him as a proxy for Hudsucker. Across town, Amy Archer, a brassy Pulitzer Prize–winning reporter for the Manhattan Argus newspaper, is assigned to write a story about Norville and find out what kind of man he really is. She obtains a job at Hudsucker Industries as his personal secretary, pretending to be yet another desperate graduate from his alma mater in Muncie. One night, Amy searches the building for clues and meets Moses, who operates the tower's giant clock and knows \"just about anything if it concerns Hudsucker\". He tells her Mussburger's plot, and she takes the story back to her Chief, but he does not believe it. The other executives at Hudsucker Industries decide to produce Norville's invention in hopes that it will flop and further depress the company's stock. However, the invention is the hula-hoop, which initially fails in obscurity but then becomes an enormous success. Norville allows success to go to his head and becomes yet another uncaring tycoon. Amy, who had fallen for his naive charm, is infuriated over Norville's new attitude and leaves him. Buzz, the eager elevator operator, pitches a new invention: the bendy straw, which Buzz calls the \"Buzz-sucker.\" Norville insults the idea and cruelly fires Buzz, ignoring his pleas that he needs the job. Meanwhile, Aloysius, a Hudsucker janitor, discovers Amy's true identity and informs Mussburger. Mussburger reveals Amy's secret identity to Norville and tells him he will be dismissed as president after the new year. Mussburger also convinces the board that Norville is insane and must be sent to the local psychiatric hospital. On New Year's Eve, Amy finds Norville drunk at a beatnik bar. She apologizes, but he storms out and is chased by an angry mob led by Buzz. Norville escapes to the top floor of the Hudsucker skyscraper and changes back into his mailroom uniform. He climbs out on the ledge, where Aloysius locks him out and watches as he slips and falls off the building at the stroke of midnight. While Norville plummets, Moses stops the building's giant clock, which freezes time. Waring Hudsucker appears to Norville as an angel and tells him to read the Blue Letter (still in Norville's uniform pocket) that was supposed to be delivered to Mussburger: it contains Hudsucker's instructions to transfer his shares to his immediate successor as president, rather than to the public. This would have been Mussburger, but, unaware of this, he proceeded with his scheme to elect Norville. Inside the building's giant clock, Moses fights Aloysius, defeating him. Norville descends safely to the ground. He and Amy reconcile. As 1959 progresses, Mussburger, after learning about Hudsucker's instructions, attempts suicide and is sent to an asylum, while Norville develops a new invention for kids: another enigmatic circle that ultimately turns out to be a frisbee.",

    "Synopsis": "Leaving his family in France, young Ariel Brenner goes to Israel and is recruited by the Mossad. After training, he is part of a team sent to Paris to entrap a French nuclear scientist who is working on plans for a power plant in a Middle Eastern country (a fictionalised version of the Osirak site in Iraq). While the scientist's co-operation is secured through blackmail, using a delightful call-girl who Ariel recruits named Marie-Claude, his Arab counterpart refuses, despite Marie-Claude's charms, and is assassinated. To the alarm of their US allies, the Israeli armed forces then bomb the plant out of existence. An American intelligence operative in Washington named Jeremy Pelman (a fictionalised Jonathan Pollard) is sympathetic to the Israeli cause and through Ariel offers to feed them useful information. As a spy he is not very competent, sharing everything with his wife, and when he comes under suspicion from his superiors, tries to defect. The Israelis, to avoid further alarm from their allies, hand him back. Back in Israel, Ariel is on surveillance at the airport when Marie-Claude happens to fly in. He takes her into an office, locks the door and pulls down the blinds.",

Outside the set of a film in which he is acting, he makes a marriage proposal to his leading lady, a student named Tahereh, who was orphaned by the Manjil-Rudbar earthquake. Because he is poor and illiterate, the girl's family finds his offer insulting; the girl avoids him as a result. She continues evading him even when they are filming, and she seems to have trouble grasping the difference between her role in the film and her real-life self. The fictional couple takes part in what would be the filming of And Life Goes On. The situation complicates further as Hossein still pursues the affections of the young actress while the film goes on. The director learns about this and subtly tries to advise Hossein about what to do. He then illustrates their story and where the conflict began. The girl manages to finish the scene while Hossein attempts to woo her and then departs by walking as Hossein runs after her. In the final scene, at a great distance, the girl finally gives an answer to Hossein, who is seen running through a green field and back into the olive grove.

    "Synopsis": "In the 1940s, Xu Fugui, a rich man's son and compulsive gambler, loses his family property to a man named Long'er. His father dies after signing over the family house to Long'er, and wife Jiazhen, leaves him, along with their daughter, Fengxia, and their unborn son, Youqing. Long'er does, however, give Fugui a set of shadow puppets. He starts a shadow puppet troupe with a partner named Chunsheng. The Chinese Civil War is occurring at the time, and Fugui and Chunsheng are conscripted into the Kuomintang's Republic of China armed forces during a performance. Midway through the war, the two are captured by the communist People's Liberation Army and earn a certificate of commendation for performing their shadow puppet operas for the communist revolutionaries. After the Communist victory, Fugui returns home. Upon arrival, he learns that Fengxia, his daughter, has become mute and partially deaf due to a week-long fever. Soon after his return, Fugui learns that Long'er burned all his property just to deny the new regime from seizing it. No one helped put out the fire because Long'er was a gentry. He is eventually put on trial and sentenced to execution. As Long'er is pulled away, he recognizes Fugui in the crowd and tries to talk to him as he is dragged toward the execution grounds. Realizing that Long'er's fate would have been his if not for his \"misfortune\" years earlier, Fugui is filled with fear and runs into an alleyway before hearing five gunshots. He runs home to tell Jiazhen what has happened, and they quickly pull out the certificate stating that Fugui served in the communist People's Liberation Army. Jiazhen assures him they are no longer gentries and will not be killed. The story moves forward a decade into the future, to the time of the Great Leap Forward. The local town chief enlists everyone to donate all scrap iron to the national drive to produce steel and make weaponry for invading Taiwan. As an entertainer, Fugui performs for the entire town nightly, and is very smug about his singing abilities. Soon after, some boys begin picking on Fengxia. Youqing decides to get back at one of the boys by dumping spicy noodles on his head during a communal lunch. Fugui is furious, but Jiazhen stops him and tells him why Youqing acted the way he did. Fugui realizes the love his children have for each other. The children are exhausted from the hard labor they are doing in the town and try to sleep whenever they can. They eventually get a break during the festivities for meeting the scrap metal quota. The entire village eats dumplings in celebration. In the midst of the family eating, schoolmates of Youqing call for him to come prepare for the District Chief. Jiazhen tries to make Fugui let him sleep but eventually relents and packs her son twenty dumplings for lunch. Fugui carries his son to the school, and tells him to heat the dumplings before eating them, as he will get sick if he eats cold dumplings. He must listen to his father to have a good life. Later on in the day, the older men and students rush to tell Fugui that his son has been killed by the District Chief. He was sleeping on the other side of a wall that the Chief's Jeep was on, and the car ran into the wall, injuring the Chief and crushing Youqing. Jiazhen, in hysterics, is forbidden to see her son's dead body, and Fugui screams at his son to wake up. Fengxia is silent in the background. The District Chief visits the family at the grave, only to be revealed as Chunsheng. His attempts to apologize and compensate the family are rejected, particularly by Jiazhen, who tells him he owes her family a life. He returns to his Jeep in a haze, only to see his guard restraining Fengxia from breaking the Jeep's windows. He tells the guard to stop and walks home. The story moves forward again another decade, to the Cultural Revolution. The village chief advises Fugui's family to burn their puppet drama props, which have been deemed as counter-revolutionary. Fengxia carries out the act, and is oblivious to the Chief's real reason for coming: to discuss a suitor for her. Fengxia is now grown up and her family arranges for her to meet Wan Erxi, a local leader of the Red Guards. Erxi, a man crippled by a workplace accident, fixes her parents' roof and paints depictions of Mao Zedong on their walls with his workmates. He proves to be a kind, gentle man; he and Fengxia fall in love and marry, and she soon becomes pregnant. Chunsheng, still in the government, visits immediately after the wedding to ask for Jiazhen's forgiveness, but she refuses to acknowledge him. Later, he is branded a reactionary and a capitalist. He comes to tell them his wife has committed suicide and he intends to as well. He has come to give them all his money. Fugui refuses to take it. However, as Chunsheng leaves, Jiazhen commands him to live, reminding him that he still owes them a life. Months later, during Fengxia's childbirth, her parents and husband accompany her to the county hospital. All doctors have been sent to do hard labor for being over educated, and the students are left as the only ones in charge after they have \"overthrown\" the doctors. Wan Erxi manages to find a doctor to oversee the birth, removing him from confinement, but he is very weak from starvation. Fugui purchases seven steamed buns (mantou) for him and the family decides to name the son Mantou, after the buns. However, Fengxia begins to hemorrhage, and the nurses panic, admitting that they do not know what to do. The family and nurses seek the advice of the doctor, but find that he has overeaten and is semiconscious. The family is helpless, and Fengxia dies from postpartum hemorrhage (severe blood loss). The point is made that the doctor ate 7 buns, but that by drinking too much water at the same time, each bun expanded to the size of 7 buns: therefore Fengxia's death is a result of the doctor's having the equivalent of 49 buns in his belly. The movie ends six years later, with the family now consisting of Fugui, Jiazhen, their son-in-law Erxi, and grandson Mantou. The family visits the graves of Youqing and Fengxia, where Jiazhen, as per tradition, leaves dumplings for her son. Erxi buys a box full of young chicks for his son, which they decide to keep in the chest formerly used for the shadow puppet props. When Mantou inquires how long it will take for the chicks to grow up, Fugui's response is a more tempered version of something he said earlier in the film. He expresses optimism for his grandson's future, and the film ends with his statement, \"and life will get better and better\" as the whole family sits down to eat.",

    "Synopsis": "William Adamson, a naturalist, returns to Victorian England, staying with his benefactor, Sir Harold Alabaster, a wealthy Baronet. William has lost his possessions in a shipwreck, returning from an extended expedition to the Amazon. Now dependent upon his patron, he is employed to catalog Sir Harold's specimen collection and teach his younger children the natural sciences, assisting their governess, the unassuming Matty Crompton. William becomes enamoured of Sir Harold's eldest daughter, Eugenia. Eugenia is softly spoken, anxious, and mourning the recent death of her fiancé. Despite his impoverishment, Eugenia proves receptive and accepts his marriage proposal. Although Sir Harold grants his approval, Eugenia's snobbish and spoilt brother Edgar dislikes William's humble origins. Soon after the marriage, Eugenia becomes pregnant. Eugenia's behaviour alternates between coldness, locking William out of her room, and intense sexual passion. The couple has five children. She names one son Edgar, in her family's tradition, annoying William. He spends much of his time with the Alabaster children and Matty, observing an ant colony in the forest, with a view to writing a book. Returning via the stables from an excursion, William discovers Edgar raping a teenage servant. Edgar tells William that she consented, but she is clearly terrified. William forms a bond with Matty, who encourages his scientific activities and displays a strong intelligence. The book is successfully published. One day, William is summoned from the hunt to the house by a servant who claims Eugenia wants him. Entering the bedroom, he finds Eugenia and Edgar engaging in incestuous sex. Eugenia confesses that this has occurred since childhood and that her fiancé committed suicide in consequence. She says that when it started she was too young to understand but, after she saw herself through the eyes of her fiancé, she felt guilty. In tears, Eugenia explains that she tried to stop, but that Edgar's will was too strong. William realises that he has been used to conceal the incest and that the children (who bear no resemblance to him) are Edgar's. Matty reveals her knowledge of the affair to William during a Scrabble-like game. Later, she explains that the servants were also aware and arranged for him to find out. Expressing frustration at her life and dependency on the Alabasters, Matty reveals that she has published her own book on the insects and has bought tickets for a ship for the Amazon. William is reluctant; despite his attraction, he feels that the rainforest is unsuitable for a woman. After she assures him of her strength and love for him, William acquiesces. Before leaving, William meets Eugenia and tells her he intends never to return but will continue to financially support their children. He also promises to keep her secret, for fear of injuring her ailing father, and hopes she may find a way to live with her guilt. William and Matty depart in a coach for Liverpool, eager to begin their new adventure and leave the past behind.",

There he meets Carrington for the first time, initially assuming she is a boy and not hiding his disappointment when disabused. Lytton is due to face a hearing with the military to decide his fate as a conscientious objector. While taking a countryside hike, Carrington shares with Lytton a similar disappointment at not being a boy. Lytton forces an awkward kiss onto Carrington, infuriating her. Early the next morning, Carrington walks into his bedroom intending to cut his beard off in retaliation for the kiss, but stops in contemplation of him sleeping and falls in love with him. Lytton avoids war and prison on medical grounds. # Gertler 1916–1918: Mark Gertler has been attempting to have sex with Carrington for four years, with a great number of their shared circle conspiring to pressure Carrington to acquiesce.

When Gertler later finds out that Carrington and Lytton are moving in together, he assaults Lytton. # Partridge 1918–1921: Carrington meets Ralph Partridge, who has come back from the war. Her relationship with Lytton has taken on a sadomasochistic cast, and she introduces Ralph in the hopes that Lytton will be attracted to him.

Lytton goes on vacation to Italy. Ralph has made clear his intent of either marrying Carrington or emigrating to Bolivia to run a sheep farm. Ralph bullies Carrington into believing that, if Ralph is no longer with him, Lytton will move out of Mill House.

On their honeymoon, Carrington and Ralph meet with Lytton in Venice, who seems pleased with how things have shaken out. # Brenan 1921–1923: Despite her marriage, Carrington continues to spend most of her time at Mill House while Ralph remains largely in London.

    "Synopsis": "William Blake, an accountant from Cleveland, Ohio, rides by train to the frontier company town of Machine to take up a promised accounting job in the town's metal works. During the trip, the train fireman warns Blake against the enterprise. Arriving in town, Blake notes the hostility of the townsfolk towards him. He then discovers that the position has already been filled, and John Dickinson, the ferocious owner of the company, drives Blake from the workplace at gunpoint. Jobless and without money or prospects, Blake meets Thel Russell, a former prostitute who sells paper flowers. He lets her take him home. Thel's ex-boyfriend Charlie surprises them in bed, shoots at Blake, and accidentally kills Thel when she shields Blake with her body. The bullet passes through Thel and wounds Blake, who kills Charlie with Thel's gun before climbing out the window and fleeing the town on Charlie's horse. Company owner Dickinson is Charlie's father and hires three killers — Cole Wilson, Conway Twill, and Johnny \"The Kid\" Pickett — to bring Blake back \"dead or alive\". Blake awakens to find a large Native American man trying to dislodge the bullet from his chest. The man, calling himself Nobody, reveals that the bullet is too close to Blake's heart to remove, rendering Blake effectively a walking dead man. When he learns Blake's full name, Nobody decides Blake is a reincarnation of William Blake, the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century English poet, whom he idolizes, but of whom Blake is ignorant. He decides to care for Blake and to use Native methods to help ease him into death. Blake learns of Nobody's past, marked by prejudice from Euro-Americans who objected to his Indigenous ancestry, and equally from Native Americans who objected that his mother and father were from two opposing tribes, Piikáni and Apsáalooke, respectively. As a child, English soldiers abducted and brought him to Europe as a model savage. He was briefly educated before returning home, where his stories of the white man and his culture were laughed off by fellow Native Americans. They thus dub him Xebeche: \"He who talks loud, saying nothing\". Nobody resolves to escort Blake to the Pacific Ocean to return him to his proper place in the spirit world. Blake and Nobody travel west, leaving a trail of dead and encountering wanted posters announcing growing bounties for Blake's death or capture. Nobody leaves Blake alone in the wild when he decides Blake must undergo a vision quest. On his quest, Blake kills two U.S. Marshals, experiences visions of nature spirits, and grieves over the remains of a dead fawn his pursuers accidentally kill. He paints his face with the fawn's blood and rejoins Nobody. Meanwhile, the most ferocious member of the bounty hunter posse, Cole Wilson, has killed his comrades (eating one of them) and continued his hunt alone. At a trading post, a bigoted missionary identifies Blake and attempts to kill him but instead dies at Blake's hands. Shortly after, Blake is shot again, and his condition rapidly deteriorates. Nobody hurries to take him by the river to a Makah village and persuades the tribe to give him a canoe for Blake's ship burial. Delirious, Blake trudges through the village, where the people pity him, before he collapses from his injuries. He awakens in a canoe on a beach wearing a Native American funeral dress. Nobody bids Blake farewell and then pushes the canoe out to sea. As he floats away, Blake sees Cole approaching Nobody. Too weak to cry out, he can only watch as the two shoot and kill each other. Looking up at the sky one last time, Blake dies as his canoe drifts out to sea.",

    "film_title": "Ed Wood (film)",
    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words --> In 1952, aspiring writer and director Ed Wood is struggling to break into the film industry. After learning that producer George Weiss is trying to purchase Christine Jorgensen's life story, Ed meets with Weiss to direct a now fictionalized film titled I Changed My Sex! but is rejected. Ed then meets his longtime idol, horror film actor Bela Lugosi, whom he befriends. Ed persuades Weiss to let him direct by arguing that having a star in the film would sell tickets, and they could sign the financially struggling Lugosi for a low price. Ed shows the film's completed script to his girlfriend, Dolores Fuller, and reveals that he is secretly a transvestite, (having worn women's clothing for personal comfort since childhood) but Fuller struggles to accept this. During production for Glen or Glenda, which is now about a transvestite, Ed shoots only one take per scene, gives actors little direction, and uses stock footage to fill in gaps. The film is released to critical and commercial failure, preventing Ed from getting work at Weiss' Screen Classics or making a partnership with Warner Bros. executive Feldman. On the advice of Fuller, Ed decides to finance his next film, Bride of the Atom, independently. He befriends Tor Johnson after a wrestling match and casts him. Meanwhile, Ed discovers that Lugosi has developed a morphine addiction. Following a failed fundraising dinner at the Brown Derby, Ed meets Loretta King, whom he mistakes for a wealthy heiress; he asks her to fund the film and casts her as the lead instead of Fuller, who is relegated to a smaller role, infuriating her. Filming begins but is halted when it is revealed that Loretta is actually poor, so Ed convinces meat-packing industry tycoon Don McCoy to continue funding the film, who agrees as long as his son is cast as the lead. At the wrap party for the film, now retitled Bride of the Monster, Fuller breaks up with Ed due to his cross-dressing and the poor quality of his films. After the government cuts off Lugosi's unemployment benefits, he checks himself into rehab to cure his drug addiction, and Ed meets Kathy O'Hara, who is visiting her father there. He takes her on a date and reveals his transvestism to her, which she accepts, and they begin a relationship. After Lugosi is checked out of rehab, he and Ed shoot scenes for a new film outside his home. Ed and company—including TV horror host Vampira—later attend the premiere of Bride of the Monster, where an angry mob chases them out of the theater. Lugosi dies, leaving Ed without a star. After learning that his landlord's church is struggling to produce a series of religious films about the Twelve Apostles, Ed convinces him to have his church fund his script for a science fiction film, Grave Robbers from Outer Space, which could result in a box-office success and generate enough money for the landlord's dream project. Ed hires Vampira, Tor, The Amazing Criswell, and Kathy's chiropractor Dr. Tom Mason to star in the film (the latter being a stand-in for Lugosi), and he and all his friends partake in a baptism ceremony at the church. During filming, Ed clashes with the Baptists over the title, script content, and Ed's B movie directing style, eventually renaming the film Plan 9 from Outer Space. Frustrated, Ed goes to the nearest bar, where he encounters filmmaker Orson Welles who, struggling with similar issues while working on Don Quixote, encourages Ed to assert his artistic vision, and cites Citizen Kane as the project where he had complete creative control. Filming concludes with Ed defying his producers' wishes. At the premiere of Plan 9 from Outer Space, Ed dedicates the film to Lugosi, and as the film plays, he quietly tells himself, \"This is the one I'll be remembered for.\" Afterwards, Ed and Kathy head to Las Vegas to get married. A textual epilogue reveals that Ed failed to achieve mainstream success in Hollywood before his death in 1978, and was posthumously named \"Worst Director of All Time\", though that honor eventually earned him worldwide acclaim and a new generation of fans.",

    "film_title": "Jefferson in Paris",
    "Synopsis": "Set in the period 1784–1789, the film portrays Jefferson when he was US minister to France at Versailles before the French Revolution. French liberals and intellectuals hope he will lead them away from the corruption of the court of King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette and toward a more democratic form of government. Although deploring the poverty of the common people, he embraces the riches of French culture and civilization. It is his first time abroad, and he takes advantage of the opportunity to extend his knowledge of liberal arts and science while absorbing the refinements France has to offer. A lonely widower, Jefferson develops a close friendship with Maria Cosway, a beautiful (and married) Anglo-Italian painter and musician. Although she becomes increasingly devoted to him, he is attached to his memory of his late wife, to whom he promised that he would not remarry, and to his two younger daughters. Patsy, his eldest daughter, is especially possessive and becomes jealous of Maria's influence on her father. Maria becomes his confidant and correspondent, and their relationship soon becomes romantic, though it is complicated by Maria's marriage and Thomas's vow to his late wife never to remarry. Later, Jefferson becomes attracted to Sally Hemings, his enslaved maid and companion of his younger daughter Polly. Three-quarters white in ancestry, she is his late wife's half-sister. Their father had taken Sally's slave mother as a concubine after he was widowed for the third time; Sally is the sixth of their children. Sally's enslaved brother James Hemings is also in Paris, training to be a French chef for Jefferson at Monticello. It is strongly implied that Jefferson begins a sexual relationship with Sally, which Patsy is aware of and disgusted by. She implies the truth to Maria, who witnesses the familiarity between Jefferson and Sally first-hand and, already having felt neglected by Jefferson, swiftly ends her relationship with him. When George Washington offers Jefferson the post of Secretary of State, he accepts and prepares to sail home with his family. Sally reveals to James that she is pregnant by Jefferson, but James, having enjoyed his freedom in Paris, is unwilling to return to the United States and urges Sally to remain with him for the sake of her child. It is only when Jefferson promises, making an oath upon the Bible, that he will give James and Sally their freedom that they consent to return with him. Jefferson extends his oath to promise freedom to all of Sally's children as well upon his death, with Patsy bearing witness and swearing to carry out his promise.",

    "Synopsis": "Telly and a 12-year-old girl are making out on a bed. With no adults around, Telly, who is a scrawny 16-year-old, talks with the girl, a virgin, and they have sex. Afterwards, he meets his best friend, Casper, and they talk about his sexual experience. Telly has taken to only having sex with virgins. They then enter a local store, where Casper shoplifts a 40 oz bottle of malt liquor and on the way out Casper steals two peaches from a Korean fruit vendor. Looking for drugs, food, and a place to hang out, they head to their friend Paul's apartment despite disliking him. As Telly and Casper sit down, they watch skaters on the TV and Casper does a whippet. As time goes on, they join the other boys in boasting about their sexual prowess and nonchalant attitudes to unprotected sex and venereal diseases. Across the city, a group of girls are talking about sex. Their attitudes contrast with that of the boys on many topics, particularly fellatio and the significance of the individuals to whom they lost their virginity. Two of the girls, Ruby and Jennie, mention that they were recently tested for STDs: Ruby tests negative, even though she has had multiple sexual encounters; Jennie tests positive for HIV. She tells the nurse that she has had sex only once, with Telly. Distraught, she tries to find him to prevent him from passing HIV on to another girl. Meanwhile, Telly and Casper walk to Telly's house and steal money from his mother. After purchasing marijuana from a Rastafarian drug dealer, they gather with a few friends and, together, taunt a gay couple passing by. As Casper rides on a skateboard, he carelessly bumps into a man who angrily threatens and pushes him. The man is struck in the back of the head with a skateboard by Casper's friend Harold, causing him to collapse. Several other skaters join in, beating the man until he is rendered unconscious by a final blow to the head by Casper. Jennie is then seen in a cab and the taxi driver gives her advice on how to be happy. Telly and some of the skaters then pick up a 13-year-old girl named Darcy—the virginal younger sister of an acquaintance—with whom Telly wants to have sex, but Darcy shows restraint. The group sneaks into a pool and go swimming with a few more friends as Harold showboats his genitals to the others. Afterward, the group goes to an unsupervised party at the house of their friend Steven. Jennie meets Misha, a girl who dislikes Casper and notes Telly's possible whereabouts at The Shelter. When Jennie arrives at the club, she runs into a boy named Fidget. The two go into a backroom and witness a person making out with three girls at the same time; while they watch Fidget shove a pill into her mouth, she learns Telly is at Steven's house. On the way, she drifts in and out of consciousness due to the effects of the pill. Telly is later seen in Steven's parents' room asking Darcy to have sex with him; later they do. Jennie arrives at the house and finds Casper drunk and singing nonsense. He tells Jennie where Telly is. Jennie witnesses Telly having sex with Darcy and does nothing to stop them, allowing Telly to expose Darcy to HIV. Jennie cries and passes out among the other partygoers. In the morning a still inebriated Casper begins to have sex with an also still inebriated Jennie, unwittingly exposing himself to HIV. After a montage shows homeless people and drug users in New York City, a voiceover by Telly says that sex is the only worthwhile thing in his life. After sunrise a naked Casper awakes and says, \"Jesus Christ, what happened?\"",

    "Synopsis": "The film's narrative unfolds in a long flashback. Elderly David Carr has died of a heart attack and his granddaughter discovers old letters, newspapers and other documents in his room: what we see in the film is what he had lived. Carr, a young unemployed worker and member of the Communist Party, leaves Liverpool and travels to Spain to join the International Brigades. He crosses the Spanish border in Catalonia and coincidentally ends up enlisted in a POUM militia commanded by Vidal, on the Aragon front. In this company, as in all POUM militias, men and women – such as the young and enthusiastic Maite – fight together. In the following weeks and months he becomes friends with other foreign volunteers, like the Frenchman, Bernard and the Irishman, Coogan and the latter's girlfriend Blanca – with whom David Carr later falls in love – also a member of POUM, and also the ideologue of his group. After being wounded and recovering in a hospital in Barcelona, he finally joins – in accordance with his original plan and against the opinion of Blanca – the government-backed International Brigades, and he encounters the Soviet propaganda and repression against POUM members and anarchists; he then returns to his old company, only to see them rounded up by a government unit requiring their surrender: in a brief clash Blanca is killed. After her funeral he returns to Great Britain with a red neckerchief full of Spanish earth. Finally the film returns to the present and we see Carr's funeral, in which his granddaughter throws the Spanish earth into his grave after speaking lines from \"The Day Is Coming\", a poem by William Morris. <blockquote>Join in the battle wherein no man can fail, <br />For whoso fadeth and dieth, yet his deed shall still prevail.</blockquote> Afterwards, she performs a raised fist salute.",

    "Synopsis": "Delia, a Neapolitan artist who has lived for many years in Bologna, returns to Naples after the sudden death of her mother Amalia, who apparently committed suicide by drowning. She doesn't believe the official verdict of suicide, convinced that her mother's exuberance, vivacity and existential positivity, which she remembers very well, would never have led her to do such a thing. She therefore begins to investigate her mother's recent past, given further impetus by disturbing phone calls received from an unknown interlocutor, whose nickname is Caserta. The fragmentary reconstruction of the last days of her mother's life bring to light remote events that Delia had hidden and buried in her memory, and force her to contemplate a reality different from what she had hitherto understood. Delia remembers and relives the moment when, under the influence of her oppressive father, she breaks her relationship with her mother, accused by her husband of an affair with Caserta. Finally, Delia recalls what was the cause of everything: as a child, she was subjected to pedophilia by Caserta's father, but she did not report the incident and told her father that her mother and Caserta, who seemed to be nothing more than friends, were lovers (this was also due to a sort of jealousy towards her mother herself); her father, very jealous of his wife whose beauty enchanted many men, began to beat her and, together with her brother-in-law, also Caserta and the latter's son, Antonio. Caserta, as if to \"get revenge\" on Delia's father, began to send Amalia gifts of all kinds, each time unleashing the fury of her husband, who regularly beat her. Shortly before committing suicide, Amalia resumed her relationship with Caserta, with whom she went for a walk on the beach one evening, and during which she left him, who had fallen asleep in the meantime, letting herself drown. Delia, having ideally reconciled with her mother, and having become aware that she has more in common with her than she believed or wanted, is ready to return to Bologna with a renewed self-awareness.",

    "film_title": "The City of Lost Children",
    "Synopsis": "Krank (Daniel Emilfork), a highly intelligent but malicious being created by a vanished scientist, is unable to dream, which causes him to age prematurely. At his lair on an abandoned oil rig (which he shares with the scientist's other creations: six childish clones, a dwarf named Martha, and a brain in a vat named Irvin) he uses a dream-extracting machine to steal dreams from children. The children are kidnapped for him from a nearby port city by a cyborg cult called the Cyclops, whom in exchange he supplies with mechanical eyes and ears. Among the kidnapped is Denrée (Joseph Lucien), the adopted little brother of carnival strongman One (Ron Perlman). After the carnival manager is stabbed by a mugger, One is hired by a criminal gang of orphans (run by a pair of conjoined twins called \"the Octopus\") to help them steal a safe. The theft is successful, but the safe is lost in the harbor when One is distracted by seeing Denrée's kidnappers. He, together with one of the orphans, a little girl called Miette (Judith Vittet), follows the Cyclops and infiltrates their headquarters, but they are captured and sentenced to execution. Meanwhile, the Octopus orders circus performer Marcello (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) to return One to them. He uses his trained fleas, which inject a poison capsule that causes mindless aggression, to turn the Cyclops guards against each other. While Marcello is rescuing One, Miette falls into the harbor and sinks, seemingly drowned, but an amnesiac diver living beneath the harbor rescues her. Miette leaves the diver's lair to find One and Marcello both drowning their sorrows in a bar. Upon seeing Miette alive, the remorseful Marcello lets One leave with her. However, the Octopus confronts them on the pier, and uses Marcello's stolen fleas to turn One against Miette. A spectacular chain of events triggered by one of Miette's tears leads to a ship crashing into the pier before One can throttle her. Marcello arrives and sets the fleas on the Octopus, allowing One and Miette to escape to continue searching for Denrée. Back at Krank's oil rig, Irvin tricks one of the clones into releasing a plea for help in the form of a bottled dream telling the story of what is going on on the oil rig. It reaches One, Miette, and the diver, and the latter remembers that he was the scientist who made them, and that the oil rig was his laboratory before Krank and Martha attacked him and pushed him off it to take it for themselves, leaving him for dead in the water. They all converge on the rig; the diver to destroy it, and One and Miette to rescue Denrée. Miette is almost killed by Martha, who is harpooned to death by the diver, pretending her \"allergy to iron\". Miette then finds Denrée asleep in Krank's dream-extracting machine, and Irvin tells her that to release him she must use the machine to enter the dream herself. In the dream world, she meets Krank and makes a deal with him to replace the boy as the source of the dream; Krank fears a trap but plays along, believing himself to be in control. Miette then uses her imagination to control the dream and turn it into an infinite loop, destroying Krank's mind. One and Miette rescue all the children, while the now-deranged diver loads the rig with dynamite and straps himself to one of its legs. The diver regains his senses as everyone is rowing away and pleads with his remaining creations to come back to rescue him, but a seabird lands on the handle of the blasting machine, blowing up him and the rig.",

    "Synopsis": "The film opens when a Paris-based American professor Michael Padovic and his elegant French wife Hélène arrive at an ancient Portuguese convent in Arrábida where he believes the documents needed to prove his theory might be in its archives: Shakespeare was born in Spain named Jacques Perez, and was Jewish. The couple is greeted by an enigmatic stranger who refers to himself as Baltar; he is the guardian of the monastery. Baltar introduced them to Berta, the housekeeper and his assistant Baltazar. For his research work, Padovic spends most of his days in the library with the beautiful librarian Piedade, while Hélène is accompanied by Baltar who eventually professes his love towards the elegant lady. As the tension increases to its dramatic climax, the film ends with an epilogue in the form of on-screen text from a fisherman's report. Baltar and Piedade went missing after a forest fire; Michael and Hélène \"left immediately\" and are leading a normal life in Paris; Michael abandoned his research on Jacques Perez and is studying occult sciences instead. It nevertheless warns the audience that the fisherman's report might not be reliable.",

    "film_title": "The Madness of King George",
    "Synopsis": "King George III's bout of madness in 1788 touched off the Regency Crisis of 1788 and triggered a power struggle between factions of Parliament under the Tory Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger and the reform-minded Leader of the Opposition Charles James Fox. At first, the King's behaviour appears mildly eccentric. He is deeply concerned with the wellbeing and productivity of Great Britain and exhibits an encyclopaedic knowledge of the families of even the most obscure royal appointments. He is devoted to his loving wife, Queen Charlotte, and their large brood of 15 children. However, he is growing more unsettled, partly over the loss of America. His memory fails, his behaviour becomes erratic and hypersexual, he talks and talks, and his urine turns blue. George, Prince of Wales, aggravates the situation, knowing that he will be named regent if the King becomes incapacitated. George chafes under his father's relentless criticism, and yearns for greater freedom, particularly when it comes to choosing a wife. He married the woman everyone believes to be his mistress, Mrs. Fitzherbert, in a secret ceremony in 1785. Without his father's consent, the marriage is illegal. Even with consent, it would remove him from the succession, because Fitzherbert is a Catholic. He knows that he has the moral support of Fox, whose agenda includes abolition of the slave trade and friendlier relations with America. Knowing how to exacerbate the King's behaviour, the Prince arranges a concert of music by Handel. The King reacts as expected, interrupting the musicians, speaking lasciviously to Lady Pembroke, and finally assaulting his son. In a private moment, the King tells Charlotte that he knows something is wrong. They are brutally interrupted when the Prince has them separated, supposedly on the advice of physicians. Led by the Prince of Wales' personal physician, Dr. Warren, the King is treated using the medical practices of the time, which focus on the state of his urine and bowel movements and include painful cupping and purgatives. Lady Pembroke recommends Dr. Francis Willis, who cured her mother-in-law. Willis uses novel procedures. At his farm in Lincolnshire, patients work to gain \"a better opinion of themselves.\" He observes to an equerry \"To be curbed, thwarted, stood up to, exercises the character.\" When the King insults him, foully, he is strapped into a chair and gagged. He will be restrained whenever he \"swears and indulges in meaningless discourse\" and \"does not strive every day and always towards his own recovery\". When the Prince has the King transferred to Kew, Charlotte watches as her beloved, bearded and wearing a soiled diaper and a straitjacket, struggles against being put in the coach. \"Until you can govern yourself, you're not fit to govern others. And until you do so, I shall govern you,\" Willis says. At Kew, the King spits soup at Willis, but gains control under the physician's intractable gaze. Later, the King, properly dressed, feeds himself to a round of applause from staff—but the delusions persist. The Whig opposition confronts Pitt's increasingly unpopular Tory government with a proposal that would give the Prince powers of regency. Baron Thurlow, the Lord Chancellor, obtains and suppresses proof of the marriage. Fox wins, and the Regency Bill is printed. Thurlow comes to see the King and joins in a moving reading of King Lear. \"I have remembered how to seem...\" the King muses. \"What, what!\" an expression he has not used in six months. His urine is yellow. Thurlow and the King arrive at Parliament in time to thwart the bill. The King forces the Prince to admit his marriage and to put away Fitzherbert. With the crisis averted, all those who have witnessed his suffering are summarily dismissed, including Captain Greville, the King's equerry. Fitzroy, another equerry, observes to the sacked Greville: \"To be kind does not commend you to kings.\" Cheering crowds welcome the royal family to St. Paul's Cathedral. Willis stands by, but the King dismisses him. \"We must be a model family,\" he declares; George wants \"something to do.\" \"Smile at the people, wave at them. Let them see that we're happy. That's why we're here.\" Saluting, Willis disappears into the crowd, where Mrs. Fitzherbert also smiles, wistfully.",

After the screening is disrupted by local ideological conflict, A takes a taxi from Greece to Albania. Ostensibly A is searching for 3 undeveloped reels of film shot by the Manaki brothers.

    "film_title": "Underground (1995 film)",
    "Synopsis": "On the morning of 6 April 1941 in Belgrade, the capital of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, two bon vivants, Petar Popara, nicknamed Crni (Blacky) and Marko Dren, head home. They pass through Kalemegdan and shout salutes to Marko's brother Ivan, an animal keeper in the Belgrade Zoo. Marko lets Blacky's pregnant wife Vera know that they have enrolled Blacky in the Communist Party (KPJ). The hungover Blacky eats breakfast while Vera complains about his supposed affair with a theatre actress. After the roar of the planes is heard, German bombs begin falling on Belgrade. After the air raid is over, Blacky goes out against Vera's wishes and inspects the devastated city. Encountering ruins and escaped animals from the zoo, he also runs into disconsolate Ivan carrying Soni, a baby chimp. The Royal Yugoslav Army's resistance is broken, and German troops occupy and dismember the Kingdom. Blacky starts operating clandestinely as a communist activist along with Marko and others. Blacky occasionally visits his mistress Natalija Zovkov who has been assigned to a special actors' labour brigade that is helping the city's rebuilding effort under German occupation. A celebrated actress in the National Theatre, Natalija has caught the eye of Franz, a high-ranking German officer. Marko has set up a weapons stash in the cellar of his grandfather's house. Following their interception of a trainload of weapons, Marko and Blacky are identified as dangerous bandits in German radio bulletins. While Blacky hides in the woods as Germans intensify door-to-door raids, Marko takes Vera, Ivan and others into the cellar to hide. Vera gives birth to a baby boy, who she names Jovan before dying. In 1944, Blacky is in town to celebrate Jovan's birthday at a communist hangout. The two best friends head for the theatre and see Natalija performing on stage in front of Franz and other German officers. Blacky shoots Franz in the chest (he survives) and, along with Natalija and Marko, reaches the river boat anchored outside Belgrade. There, they all get ready for a forced wedding despite Natalija's protestations. The party is interrupted by German soldiers surrounding the boat. Franz yells, demanding Blacky and Marko release Natalija, who runs to him. Blacky is captured by Germans and tortured in a hospital with electric shocks while Franz and Natalija visit her brother Bata there. Meanwhile, Marko finds a way to enter the building through an underground sewer passage. Sneaking up on Franz, Marko strangles him to death with a cord in front of Natalija who switches sides once again. Marko then proceeds to free Blacky. They leave with a fatigued Blacky hidden in a suitcase, but he is injured by a grenade. Days later on Easter 1944, Marko and Natalija, now a couple, watch a comatose Blacky. In late October, the Red Army accompanied by Yugoslav Partisans enters Belgrade. Marko gives speeches from the National Theater balcony during the Trieste crisis, socializes with Josip Broz Tito, Aleksandar Ranković and Edvard Kardelj, and stands next to Tito during military parades through downtown Belgrade. In 1961, Marko is one of Tito's closest associates and advisors. The physically recovered Blacky and company are still in the cellar under the impression that the War is still going on above. Marko and Natalija attend a ceremony to open a cultural center and unveil a statue of Petar Popara Blacky, who everyone thinks died, becoming a People's Hero. With the help of his grandfather who is in on the con, Marko oversees the weapons manufacturing and even controls time by removing hours to a day so the people in the cellar think that only 15 years passed since the beginning of World War II instead of 20. The filming of a state-sponsored motion picture based on Marko's memoirs titled Proleće stiže na belom konju (Spring Comes On A White Horse) begins above ground. Soon, Blacky's son Jovan will marry Jelena, a girl he grew up with in the cellar. Soni wanders into a tank and fires it, blowing a hole in the wall. Soni wanders off, and Ivan follows. Blacky, with his son Jovan, emerges from underground for the first time in decades. They encounter the movie set and, believing the war is still on, kill two extras and the actor playing Franz. In the manhunt, Jovan drowns but Blacky escapes. In 1992, at the height of the Yugoslav Wars, Ivan re-emerges with Soni with whom he was recently reunited. He stumbles upon Marko who attempts to broker an arms deal in the middle of a conflict zone. The deal falls through and Ivan catches up with Marko and beats him to unconsciousness, then commits suicide. Natalija arrives and rushes to Marko's side. They are captured by militants and they are ordered to be executed as arms dealers by militants' commander, Blacky. Blacky moves his people out to the cellar where he lived years ago, taking Soni with him. He sees an image of Jovan in a well, and falls in while reaching for him, presumably ending his life as well. In a dreamlike sequence, Blacky, Marko, Vera and others re-emerge from underneath the water and are reunited at an outside dinner party on a small grass peninsula to celebrate Jovan's wedding. Ivan gives a few parting words, saying that they will impart to their children fairy tales that start with \"Once upon a time, there was a country.\" As the group sings and dances, the ground separates from the peninsula, forming an island, and seemingly floats away into the distance with them still on it.",

    "film_title": "A Self-Made Hero",
    "Synopsis": "The film is presented in the style of a historical documentary, with an elderly Dehousse narrating the events of his life, interspersed with interviews with other characters and historians. Albert Dehousse has grown up on heroic novels, unfortunately his life isn't quite so exciting. Albert lives in a village in northern France with his mother, who lives in memory of her husband, who she claims died a hero in the First World War. As a child, Albert learns that his father in fact died of cirrhosis of the liver. When the Second World War begins, Albert is not called up as he is the only child of a war widow, denying him his chance to become a hero. He marries Yvette Caron, a local girl, and works for her father as a sales agent. Following the liberation of France, Madame Dehousse is revealed to have been a collaborator and is persecuted by the French Resistance. Albert learns that his father-in-law is the head of a local Resistance network. Devastated by the revelation, he leaves his family for Paris. In Paris, he is taken under the wing of Captain Dionnet, a homosexual Free French fighter, who finds Albert a place to stay in a local brothel. The Captain advises Albert that in the chaos of postwar France it is possible for a man to become anything, even a Resistance fighter. Albert begins a relationship with Odette, one of the girls at the brothel, while working for Monsieur Jo, a rich collaborationist, and memorising Jo's list of contacts. Eventually, Jo is arrested, and at the same time the Captain enlists to fight in Germany, having fallen in love with an American soldier. He leaves Albert a note reiterating his advice. Albert takes a room near the Army School with the Louvier family. He learns all he can about the Resistance and leads the Louviers to believe that he was a Lieutenant in the Free French army. Through careful observation, study and bluffing, together with his memories of the Captain's stories, he manages to gain access to Resistance circles and eventually befriends many veterans. Interviews with veterans later in life show that many of them seem to recall having met him in London during the war. When he encounters an officer who recalls the name Dehousse (having dealt with Albert's mother's application for a pension) Albert claims that \"Dehousse\" is a pseudonym and he is actually a Polish Jew called Rozinsky, taking the name of former tenants of the Louviers who were captured and deported during the war. Eventually, on the strength of his network and popularity, and his extensive memory of names of collaborators from his time with M. Jo, Albert is given a junior government position advising on suitability of appointments. At a social event, he meets Servane, the mistress of an officer, who indicates her desire for him, but he is called away before their relationship can progress. After the fall of Germany, Albert is appointed to a general's staff in French-occupied Germany, working in psychological operations in Baden-Baden with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. On his way through Germany, he briefly crosses paths with the Captain, who is delighted to see what has become of Albert. Although initially coldly-received by his junior officers, Albert wins them over with his gracious manner. One officer, Boutin, becomes suspicious of him after Albert claims to be suffering from an old bullet wound to excuse a poor performance at tennis, but is unable to persuade any of his colleagues. Boutin tells the viewer that he was later killed fighting in French Indochina. Servane is posted to Baden-Baden and she and Albert begin a relationship. Eventually, after she questions him, Albert admits that his backstory is a forgery. The next morning, Albert's unit is called to investigate a raid on a village by what are believed to be SS resistance members. The group turn out to be French members of the Charlemagne Division, who cannot return to France for fear of punishment and are stealing to survive. Rather than send them back to France to be tried and shot, Albert orders them to be executed by firing squad on the spot. Traumatised, he writes a letter to the French command confessing the truth about his background. To avoid the risk of a major scandal, he is dealt with quietly. The only charges he faces are for bigamy, having married Servane in 1946, for which he serves three years in prison. Yvette tracks him down and she and Servane become friends. The film closes with a series of anecdotes about other accomplishments or scams by \"Dehousse\", while the elderly Dehousse asks the viewer if he was convincing.",

    "Synopsis": "Bess McNeill is a young and pretty Scottish woman who has, in the past, had treatment for an unspecified mental health condition after the death of her brother. She marries oil rig worker Jan Nyman, a Danish non-churchgoer, despite disapproval from her community and her Free Scottish Presbyterian Calvinist church. Bess is steadfast and pure of heart but quite simple and childlike in her beliefs. During her frequent visits to the church, she prays to God and carries on conversations with him in her own voice, believing that he is responding directly through her. Bess is infatuated with Jan and has difficulty living without him when he is away on the oil platform. Jan makes occasional phone calls to Bess, in which they express their love and sexual desires. Bess grows needy and prays for his immediate return. The next day, Jan is severely injured in an industrial accident and is flown back to the mainland. Bess believes her prayer was the reason the accident occurred and that God was punishing her for her selfishness in asking him to neglect his job and return to her. No longer able to perform sexually and mentally affected by the paralysis, Jan asks Bess to find a lover. Bess is devastated and storms out. Jan then attempts to commit suicide and fails. He falls unconscious and is readmitted to the hospital. Jan's condition deteriorates. He urges Bess to find another lover and tell him the details, as it will be as if they are together and will revitalize his spirits. Though her sister-in-law Dodo constantly reassures her that nothing she does will affect his recovery, Bess begins to believe these suggestions are the will of God and in accordance with loving Jan wholely. Despite her repulsion and inner turmoil at the thought of being with other men, she perseveres in her own sexual debasement, believing it will save her husband. Bess throws herself at Jan's doctor, but when he rebuffs her, she takes to picking up men off the street and allowing herself to be brutalized in increasingly cruel sexual encounters. In the face of probable expulsion from her church, she proclaims, \"You cannot love words. You cannot be in love with a word. You can only love a human being. That's perfection\". The entire village is scandalised by these doings, and Bess is excommunicated. Dodo and Jan's doctor agree the only way to keep Bess safe from herself is to have her committed and move as far away from her husband — whom they believe to be in terminal decline — as possible. Bess decides to make what she thinks is the ultimate sacrifice for Jan: she unflinchingly returns to a derelict ship, where sailors brutally attack her. Dodo and Mrs. McNeill meet a severely injured Bess in the hospital for the last time, forgiving her for her actions. Bess dies in Dodo's arms. Her church deems her soul to be lost and hell-bound. Unbeknownst to the church elders, Jan and his friends have substituted bags of sand for Bess's body inside her sealed coffin. Without notice to the church elders, Dodo condemns them, saying no-one has the right to consign Bess to hell. Later, Jan is shown, substantially restored to health despite the doctors not having thought it possible, burying Bess in the ocean, deep in grief. The film ends in magical realism as Bess's body is nowhere to be seen on the sonar, and church bells ring from on high in the sky.",

    "Synopsis": "Film producer James Ballard and his wife, Catherine, are in an open marriage. The couple engages in various trysts, using the intimate details of their extramarital encounters to fuel their own sexual relations. Catherine recounts a sexual encounter she had that day with a stranger in a prop plane hangar, but she was left unsatisfied. When James responds that he did not achieve satisfaction during his own encounter with a coworker due to an interruption by a film crew member, Catherine replies, \"Maybe the next one.\" One night, while driving home from work, James's car collides head-on with another, killing its male passenger. While trapped in the fused wreckage, Dr. Helen Remington, the driver and the dead passenger's wife, exposes a breast to James as she removes the shoulder harness of her seatbelt. During his recovery, James meets Helen again and also encounters Robert Vaughan, who shows a keen interest in the brace holding James's shattered leg together. After departing the hospital, Helen and James begin an affair, driven primarily by their shared experience of the car crash. They attend one of Vaughan's cult-like performance pieces, where he meticulously recreates the car crash that killed James Dean using replica cars and stunt drivers. When Department of Transport officials break up the event, James flees with Helen and Vaughan. James soon becomes one of Vaughan's followers, who fetishize car crashes, obsessively watch car safety test videos, photograph traffic collisions, and recount the deaths of famous people in road accidents. Catherine, who has noticed Vaughan following her in his car on several occasions, begins to fantasize about him and James having sex. Although Vaughan initially claims that he is interested in the \"reshaping of the human body by modern technology,\" his true project is living out the philosophy that the car crash is a \"benevolent psychopathology that beckons toward us.\" James drives Vaughan's Lincoln convertible around the city while Vaughan picks up a prostitute and has sex with her in the back seat. James and Catherine have sex while Catherine fantasises about James and Vaughan having sex. Shortly after, James invites Catherine on one of his and Vaughan's drives. They see police search Vaughan's convertible in connection with a pedestrian hit-and-run, leaving Vaughan distressed. On an interstate, they come across a car wreck involving Colin Seagrave, a member of the group who had been planning to authentically recreate the car accident that killed Jayne Mansfield with Vaughan. Amongst the wreckage, the three see Colin's bloodied corpse, dressed in a blonde wig and a dress to resemble Mansfield. Vaughan photographs the scene as they pass by. James notices some unexplained blood on the fender and drives them through a car wash while Vaughan and Catherine have sex in the back seat. Back home, Catherine lies in bed with visible, though superficial, wounds from Vaughan's touch, crying while James touches her. James subsequently has a tryst with Gabrielle, another member of the group, whose legs are clad in restrictive steel braces and who has a vulva-like scar on the back of one of her thighs from a crash injury. He tears her fishnet stockings open and penetrates her scar. Later, Vaughan invites James to visit a tattooist, who inks car emblems on Vaughan's body. Afterward, James and Vaughan have sex in Vaughan's car. When Vaughan rams his car into Catherine's while it is unattended, he and James aggressively pursue each other. On an overpass, Vaughan intentionally crashes his car, landing on a passenger bus below and killing himself. After Vaughan's death, Gabrielle and Helen visit a junkyard and affectionately embrace while lying in the wreck of Vaughan's car. Later, James and Catherine perform a similar stunt, with James pursuing her at high speed on a freeway. Catherine unbuckles her seatbelt as she sees James approaching, and he rams into the back of her car, causing it to topple down into a grassy median. James exits his car and approaches Catherine's, which has flipped upside down. Catherine lies partly under the car, apparently only superficially injured. When James asks if she is okay, she tells him she is not hurt. As the couple kisses and begins to have sex partly underneath the wrecked vehicle, James whispers to a crying Catherine, \"Maybe the next one.\"",

    "Synopsis": "Ilona Koponen, a head waitress at the traditional Dubrovnik restaurant, is married to Lauri, a tram driver. They live in a modestly furnished apartment in Helsinki. One evening, Lauri surprises Ilona with a new color television purchased on hire purchase. Although they worry about their debts, they agree the payments are manageable. Disaster strikes when Lauri's employer lays off workers due to the unprofitability of certain tram routes; Lauri is chosen by lottery to be fired. Shortly after, the Dubrovnik is sold to a chain that plans to replace the staff, leaving Ilona unemployed as well. The couple faces a series of humiliations in their search for work. Lauri is humiliated when he loses his professional driver's license after failing a medical exam for a bus driving job due to hearing loss. Ilona eventually finds work at a rundown bar-restaurant owned by a tax-evading crook. After six weeks of labor, the establishment is raided and shut down by the authorities; the owner vanishes without paying Ilona. As their savings dwindle, Lauri and Ilona sell their car and, in a moment of desperation, attempt to double the proceeds at a casino, only to lose everything. Their furniture and the new television are repossessed. Despite bouts of heavy drinking and depression, they maintain their dignity and bond. Ilona accidentally runs into Mrs. Sjöholm, her former boss from the Dubrovnik. Sjöholm offers to lend Ilona the capital to open her own restaurant. Although initially paralyzed by the fear of failure and debt, Ilona accepts. She names the new restaurant Work (\"Työ\") and hires her former colleagues, including the alcoholic chef Lajunen and the doorman Melartin, as well as Lauri. On opening day, the lunch hour is quiet, causing Ilona great anxiety. However, as the afternoon progresses, the restaurant fills to capacity. Lauri receives a call from a workers' union booking a reservation for thirty people. Overwhelmed, Ilona and Lauri step out to the front entrance. Unable to express their joy in words, they stand together and look up at the drifting clouds as customers continue to arrive.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1987, Jerome \"Jerry\" Lundegaard is the executive sales manager of a Minneapolis car dealership owned by his father-in-law, Wade Gustafson. Desperate for money, he plans to have his wife, Jean, kidnapped. On the recommendation of dealership mechanic and parolee Shep Proudfoot, Jerry meets Gaear Grimsrud and Carl Showalter at a bar in Fargo, North Dakota. Gaear and Carl agree to kidnap Jean in exchange for a new Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera and half of the $80,000 ransom Jerry intends to extort from Wade. Believing he has secured a $750,000 loan from Wade for a lucrative real estate deal, Jerry unsuccessfully tries to call off the kidnapping. However, Wade and his accountant Stan Grossman inform Jerry that Wade will handle the deal himself, offering Jerry only a modest finder's fee. Carl and Gaear kidnap Jean and transport her to a remote cabin in Moose Lake. A state trooper stops them near Brainerd for not displaying temporary registration tags. The trooper rejects Carl's clumsy bribe attempt and orders Carl out of the car. The trooper hears Jean whimpering in the back seat, so Gaear shoots the trooper dead, then kills two passersby who witnessed the scene. Brainerd police chief Marge Gunderson, who is seven months pregnant, begins investigating. She correctly deduces that the dead trooper was ticketing a car with dealer plates. She later learns that two men driving a dealership vehicle checked into a nearby motel with two call girls and placed a call to Shep. Marge visits Wade's dealership, where Shep feigns ignorance and Jerry nervously insists no cars are missing. While in Minneapolis, Marge reconnects with Mike Yanagita, a high school classmate. Mike awkwardly tries to romance her before breaking down and telling her his wife has died. Jerry tells Wade the kidnappers have demanded $1 million and will deal only through him. In light of the three murders, Carl demands that Jerry hand over the $80,000 he believes is the entire ransom. Shep finds Carl with a call girl in Shep's Minneapolis apartment and beats him in retaliation for bringing Shep to the police's attention. Carl angrily calls Jerry and demands that he bring the money immediately. Wade insists on delivering the ransom and meets Carl at a parking garage. Wade refuses to hand over the money without seeing his daughter, so Carl shoots him. Wade fires back, wounding Carl in the jaw. Carl kills Wade and a garage attendant, then drives away with the ransom. On the way to Moose Lake, Carl discovers the briefcase contains $1 million. He takes out $80,000 to split with Gaear and buries the rest in the snow alongside the highway. Marge learns from a friend that Yanagita lied; he has no wife and is mentally ill. Reflecting on this, Marge returns to Wade's dealership. An agitated Jerry again insists no cars are missing and tells Marge he will double-check the inventory. Marge sees Jerry driving off the lot and calls the state police. At the cabin, Carl finds that Gaear killed Jean because she would not be quiet. Carl says they should split up and leave immediately, and they argue over who will keep the Ciera. Carl insults Gaear and attempts to leave with the car, but Gaear kills him with an axe. Marge drives to Moose Lake, tipped off by a local bartender who overheard a customer brag about killing someone. She sees the Ciera, then discovers Gaear feeding Carl's body into a woodchipper. Gaear attempts to flee, but Marge shoots him in the leg and arrests him. Shortly after, Jerry is arrested by state troopers at a motel outside Bismarck, North Dakota. Marge's husband, Norm, tells her the Postal Service has selected his painting of a mallard for a 3-cent postage stamp and complains that the Hautman brothers painting won the competition for a 29-cent stamp. Marge reminds him that smaller denomination stamps make up the difference between the face value of old stamps and the new cost of first-class postage. Norm is reassured, and the couple happily anticipates the birth of their child.",

    "Synopsis": "On the afternoon before the 1934 Democratic primary election in Kansas City, petty thief Johnny O'Hara botches a robbery of Sheepshan Red, a wealthy Black gambler on a semi-annual trip to the Hey Hey Club, local Black mob kingpin Seldom Seen's jazz club and casino. As a token of respect to a highly lucrative customer, Seldom kidnaps Johnny himself and holds him at the Hey Hey Club, where he monologues to Johnny about racism and deliberates on how best to punish him. Kansas City jazz performances played at the Hey Hey Club are intercut with much of the film. Blondie O'Hara, Johnny's Jean Harlow-obsessed wife, desperately searches for a way to secure Johnny's release. She decides to kidnap Carolyn Stilton, the wife of local politician Henry Stilton, leveraging his involvement with the imminent election to force him to free Johnny. Blondie kidnaps Carolyn at the Stilton mansion without much resistance. She finds that Carolyn is trapped in a loveless marriage, nursing a laudanum addiction to cope with her husband's emotional distance. Carolyn finds Blondie's devotion to her husband admirable, and a tenuous friendship forms between the two as they travel across the city and flee the alerted police. When Blondie tells Henry about the kidnapping, he is torn between the obligation he feels towards his wife and the risks presented towards his re-election campaign. As a member of the Pendergast political machine, he secures the aid of its boss Thomas Pendergast, who agrees to indirectly reach out to Seldom. On the morning of the election, Blondie attempts to hide Carolyn at a bar owned by her brother (ironically a Pendergast ward heeler himself tasked with paying local vagrants and addicts to vote), but he realizes who Carolyn is and drives them away. When Seldom makes his decision to kill Johnny known, the latter offers to give himself as a slave to Seldom. In the evening, Blondie and Carolyn finally return to the O'Hara home, from which Johnny had been kidnapped a day before. Henry manages to get Johnny released, but Seldom and his gangsters shoot and mutilate him before turning him over, and he collapses and dies once he enters the house. As Blondie weeps over his body, Carolyn grabs her gun and shoots Blondie dead. She leaves the house and enters Henry's car. He anxiously asks her if she is alright, but she does not reply.",

    "Synopsis": "In 18th-century France, Baron Grégoire Ponceludon de Malavoy, a young, penniless, and naive aristocrat and engineer, devises a scheme to drain the marshy region of the Dombes that is causing disease, in order to improve the lot of the peasants living there. He sets off for Versailles in order to seek the support of King Louis XVI. Along the way, he is robbed and beaten, but he is taken in by the Marquis de Bellegarde, a physician, who teaches him about wit and the court's ways. Ponceludon realizes that the court is corrupt and hollow but finds solace in Mathilde de Bellegarde, the doctor's daughter, who agrees to marry a rich old man to support her science experiments and pay off her father's debts. Madame de Blayac, the beautiful and wealthy recent widow of Monsieur de Blayac, who was supposed to be Ponceludon's sponsor at court, cheats at a game of wits with the help of her lover, L'abbé de Vilecourt. Ponceludon notices but does not expose the cheating to the court and ruin Madame de Blayac's reputation. Blayac repays his generosity by arranging for the certification of his lineage, allowing his suit to proceed. Meanwhile, Ponceludon sees through the schemes of the court and realizes that he cannot trust anyone. Ponceludon sleeps with Madame de Blayac in exchange for her assistance in arranging a meeting with the King, but she maliciously has Bellegarde attend her when Ponceludon is still with her, ensuring that Mathilde learns of their relationship. Later, Ponceludon joins the King's entourage and secures a private meeting with the King to discuss his project, but he is forced into a duel with a cannoneer who insults him. Ponceludon kills the cannoneer and learns that the King cannot meet with someone who has killed one of his officers, although he is assured that it was right to uphold his honor. Madame de Blayac plots her revenge by inviting Ponceludon to a costume ball \"only for wits\", where he is tripped and ridiculed. However, he tears off his mask and condemns their decadence, vowing to drain the swamp by himself, and leaves the court with Mathilde. Some years later, in 1794, after the Revolution has forced many nobles into exile, the Marquis de Bellegarde, a refugee in Great Britain, spends some time in a nostalgic conversation. We learn from him that Ponceludon, always faithful, has been able to work on completing his goal of draining the Dombes alongside Mathilde, who is now his wife.",

Despite warnings about potential challenges, she discovers her birth mother is Cynthia Purley, a white woman working in a cardboard box factory in East London. Cynthia lives with her daughter Roxanne, a street sweeper, and tensions arise in their strained relationship. Cynthia's brother Maurice, a successful photographer, lives in the suburbs with his wife Monica, who struggles with depression over her inability to have children. Cynthia and Monica share a mutual dislike, with Monica viewing Cynthia as self-pitying and hysterical, while Cynthia sees Monica as greedy and snobbish. Maurice, caught in the middle, rarely visits Cynthia and Roxanne. However, they all anticipate celebrating Roxanne's 21st birthday. Maurice's surprise visit to Cynthia prompts an emotional breakdown, and he gives her money for house repairs, expressing a desire to host a barbecue for Roxanne's birthday. Roxanne, unknown to Cynthia, has a boyfriend named Paul, leading to a heated argument between mother and daughter. Hortense, determined to connect with her birth mother, contacts Cynthia and eventually persuades her to meet. In a face-to-face meeting, Cynthia, unprepared for Hortense's race, denies her identity until confronted with birth documents. Cynthia, overwhelmed with shame, slowly accepts the truth, and the two begin bonding. As Cynthia and Hortense develop a friendship, Roxanne notices her mother's newfound secrecy. Cynthia, planning to bring Hortense to Roxanne's birthday party, asks Maurice if she can bring a colleague from work. Despite reservations, Hortense agrees to attend and pose as Cynthia's friend. The party becomes tense, with passive-aggressive exchanges between Cynthia, Monica, and other guests. In a moment of nervousness, Cynthia reveals to Roxanne that Hortense is her daughter, leading to disbelief and anger. Maurice intervenes, convincing Roxanne to listen, while Cynthia and Monica quarrel. Cynthia berates Monica and Maurice defends her, disclosing her infertility, and urges everyone to share their pain rather than harbour resentments. Monica breaks down, Cynthia comforts her, and the two women reconcile with a hug. Cynthia reveals Roxanne's father was an American medical student who disappeared after a vacation encounter. When asked about Hortense's father, Cynthia cryptically replies, \"Don't break my heart, darling,\" and then breaks down crying and Monica and Hortense comfort her. After the party, Monica expresses her love for Maurice, and Hortense visits Cynthia and Roxanne, expressing her desire for a sister. Roxanne, despite the complexities, welcomes Hortense as her half-sister.",

    "Synopsis": "Lucy, the nineteen-year-old daughter of the recently deceased American poet and model Sara Harmon, arrives at the Tuscan villa of her mom's friends Ian and Diana Grayson. Other guests include a New York art gallery owner, an Italian advice columnist and a dying English writer, Alex Parrish. Lucy goes for a swim and finds Diana's daughter Miranda with her boyfriend, entertainment lawyer Richard Reed. Her brother, Christopher, has yet to arrive and is on a road trip with Niccolò Donati, from a nearby villa. Lucy hoped to see Niccolò, as she had met him four years before and he was her first kiss. They had briefly written, and Lucy had memorized one letter of his in particular. Lucy's father sent her so Ian could sculpt her, but she says it's really just an excuse for him to send her to Italy. Smoking marijuana with Parrish, Lucy reveals she is a virgin, which he shares with the rest of the villa the next day. Furious, Lucy decides to end her visit. However, before she can book the flight, Christopher and Niccolò appear, and Lucy is happy, but disappointed Niccolò did not recognize her. That evening, Niccolò and his brother, Osvaldo come to the Graysons'. After dinner, the youth separate from the adults to smoke marijuana. Lucy is now over Parrish's betrayal, and they take turns recounting how they each lost their virginity. When it's Osvaldo's turn, he demurs, saying, \"I don't know which is more ridiculous, this conversation or the silly political one going on over there [at the adults' table].\" Lucy fawns over Niccolò, but then vomits in his lap. The next day, Lucy cycles to the Donatis', seeking Niccolò. She's told he's in the garden, where Lucy finds him with another. Upset, she hastily cycles away from the compound. When she passes Osvaldo, he cries out, \"Ciao, Lucy!\", but she doesn't hear and then crashes. Ignoring his offer to help, she rides on. Lucy, posing outdoors for Ian's sketch, exposes one of her breasts. When Niccolò and Osvaldo arrive by car, Niccolò ogles Lucy, but Osvaldo looks away. Lucy wanders off into an adjacent olive grove, followed by Niccolò. They begin to kiss, but Lucy soon pushes him away. Retreating to the guest house, Lucy shares her notebook with Parrish. It is one of her mother's last notebooks, containing a poem Lucy thinks holds clues to the identity of her real father. Throughout the film, she has been asking probing questions about her mother. Did Parrish ever know Sara to wear green sandals? Had Ian ever eaten olive leaves? Had Carlo Lisca, a war correspondent friend of the Graysons whom Sara had known, ever killed a viper? These images are all found in the poem, which Lucy now reads to Parrish. He agrees it must refer to her dad. That evening, Lucy wears her mother's dress to the Donatis' annual party. Soon after arriving, she sees Niccolò with another girl, and they do not speak. Then she sees Osvaldo playing clarinet in the band. Later, seeing him dancing with a girl, they exchange earnest glances. Lucy picks up a young Englishman to take back to the Graysons' villa. On the way out, Osvaldo chases Lucy down, saying he's interested in visiting America. They agree to meet the next day. The Englishman spends the night with her at the villa, but without having sex. The next day, Parrish is hospitalized. Lucy skulks around his quarters in the guest house afterward. Looking out a window, seeing Ian's sculpture of a mother and child, she has an epiphany. Lucy asks Ian where he was in August 1975, when she was conceived. He says he was here, fixing up the villa, possibly when he was doing Lucy's mother's portrait. He says they could ask Diana, but then remembers she was in London, finalizing her divorce. They realize Ian is Lucy's biological father, and she promises to keep the secret. Meanwhile, Osvaldo arrives. Lucy gets stung by bees as she exits Ian's studio, so he helps, putting clay on the welts. Walking through the countryside, Osvaldo confesses he wrote to her once. This was the letter Lucy loved above all, the one she knew by heart. Osvaldo then takes her to the tree from the letter. Lucy and Osvaldo spend the night having sex under the tree. As they part the next morning, Osvaldo reveals that it was his first time, too.",

    "Synopsis": "It is the day of the abdication of Emperor Puyi; the Pang clan, a wealthy family, is in decline. Zhongliang, a thirteen-year-old boy, arrives at the Pang estate to live with his sister Xiuyi and her husband Zhengda, a heavy opium user and the son of the family head. Ruyi, daughter of the head of the family, has been raised as an opium addict from birth and is consequently unable to be married off; she is running happily through the estate when Zhongliang arrives. Duanwu, a cousin with no prospects, longs to play with Ruyi. All three momentarily share a doorway. Zhongliang is treated like a servant, including being expected to prepare Zhengda's nightly opium pipe; it is heavily implied that Zhengda sexually abuses Zhongliang by forcing him into having sex with Xiuyi. After six months of continued abuse, Zhongliang flees the estate. Ten years later, Zhongliang has become a gigolo who seduces rich, married women for his boss Biggie in order to blackmail them. The scheme involves Zhongliang meeting a woman in a room and signaling his partners. His partners in crime storm the room, \"capture\" the couple by pulling black bags over their heads, and pretend to murder Zhongliang. The woman is then blackmailed to prevent exposure of the affair. Zhongliang's success with the scam has made it highly lucrative, and Biggie treats Zhongliang like a son. Zhongliang has been seeing one particular target, \"the woman of Zephyr Lane\", for weeks, and appears to have developed feelings for her; he lies to Biggie, telling him that her husband is out of town, and thus they cannot proceed with the blackmail against her. At the Pang estate, Zhengda has been seriously ill for the past ten years; he is unable to move or speak. As a result, when her father dies, Ruyi is named the head of the family. The family elders refuse to let a woman fully control the fate of the family, since women are \"weak\". Duanwu is outside the line of succession and cannot have any designs on leading the family himself, so they name him to assist Ruyi. However, when Ruyi uses her authority to expel her father's and brother's concubines, Duanwu supports her against the elders' wishes; infuriated, the elders beat Duanwu for his lack of manliness. Ruyi reasons that the concubines have been given the freedom that she longs for and will never have. Interested in acquiring the Pang family's money, Biggie sends Zhongliang back to the estate to seduce Ruyi. Zhongliang encounters his sister, whom he hates, but who claims that Zhongliang owes her for helping him to escape the estate ten years ago. Ruyi falls in love with Zhongliang, and seduces Duanwu in order to \"practice\" for Zhongliang, who claims he will take her with him when he leaves. Zhongliang, haunted by his past and unable to go through with the plan, abandons it at the last moment and returns to Shanghai alone. Ruyi is heartbroken, unable to speak of anything else, and Duanwu is beaten by the elders again for helping Ruyi plan to leave. To atone for his failure, Zhongliang agrees to swindle the woman of Zephyr Lane. Biggie, sensing Zhongliang is wavering in his duties despite this show of loyalty, tricks Ruyi into coming to Shanghai. Ruyi is accompanied by Duanwu, and both are exposed to the modern world for the first time. Ruyi is taken to a room across the street from Zhongliang's rendezvous where she witnesses Zhongliang's scam through the window. Not caring about her husband, the woman of Zephyr Lane demands to know if Zhongliang ever loved her, a question Zhongliang doesn't answer. The woman of Zephyr Lane throws herself off the balcony; Zhongliang is distraught by her death, and Biggie observes to his subordinates that Zhongliang is now permanently \"ruined\". Ruyi comes to the dance hall and confronts Zhongliang, repeatedly asking if Zhongliang loved her or the woman of Zephyr Lane, but Zhongliang does not answer her. When Ruyi returns to the boarding room in Shanghai she shares with Duanwu, Duanwu rapes her. Ruyi returns to the Pang estate and learns that her childhood betrothal, Jingyun, has returned. Jingyun informs Ruyi that their initial betrothal was ended by his family against his wishes. Zhongliang also returns to the estate; upon learning of Jingyun's return, he desperately tries to win Ruyi back, but she informs him she no longer loves him and will soon be married to Jingyun. Zhongliang prepares her opium pipe that evening, just as he did years ago for Zhengda, and it is revealed that he poisoned Zhengda with arsenic; he poisons Ruyi's pipe in the same manner, with his sister's help, who knew that he had also poisoned her husband. Struck with remorse, Zhongliang attempts to stop Ruyi from taking the poison, but he arrives too late; the next morning, as he prepares to board a ship to leave, he is gunned down at the dock. Duanwu is proclaimed the new head of the Pang clan, while Ruyi is shown tied to a wheelchair, in the same state as her brother. A brief shot shows Zhongliang, Duanwu, and Ruyi as children, standing in the doorway on the night of the Emperor's abdication.",

    "film_title": "The Quiet Room (1996 film)",
    "Synopsis": "The Quiet Room centers on an unnamed little girl and how she deals with her parents' crumbling marriage. The film focuses entirely on her point of view and although she is silent for most of the film, we constantly hear her thoughts, sometimes in a stream of consciousness barrage of voice-over. The little girl has chosen to become mute as a way to protest her parents' constant fighting. Her parents, more concerned with their own issues, believe their daughter is just going through a phase. The film shows how even very young children can be extremely cognizant of problems that are going on in their own homes even when their parents try hard to shield them from everything. The girl learns other ways to communicate with her parents. Through her drawings, she expresses her desire of owning a dog and how she believes they will be happier as a family if they lived in the country instead of in their tiny apartment in the city. During flashbacks, we see when her parents were happy and still in love. The girl, perhaps intentionally as a way to cope, confuses tenses (thinking \"I'm little now...\" instead of \"when I was little...\"). But even then, she catches glimpses of her parents' dysfunctional relationship, such as when her father spits in her mother's face after she yells at him. Her parents don't notice she is in the room but the memory leaves a long-lasting impression on her. In the present, her anxiety manifests itself through waking nightmares where she imagines wild animals escaping from the zoo and coming to get her. At the end of the film, she hides herself in her parents' wardrobe to escape their bickering. After a while, she falls asleep in an uncomfortable position. When she wakes up, she is too stiff to move. Unable to escape on her own, the little girl finally breaks down and calls out for help and her parents, who had thought she ran away, rush to her aid. The girl gives her parents one last drawing. In it, she successfully conveys her feelings of being overwhelmed by her parents' constant fighting and how she feels less motivated to speak the more she hears them argue. As she hands it to them, she says, \"This is how I feel. That's how you make me feel.\" Finally hearing their daughter for the first time and realizing the effect their behaviour has on hers, her parents announce that they're going to move to the country. When they also promise her a dog, she becomes so ecstatic that she starts singing incessantly and dancing around her room.",

    "Synopsis": "Brandon \"Blue\" Monroe, a 16-year-old half-Navajo gang member from East L.A., is serving time in prison for murdering his abusive stepfather. On an annual medical visit, Blue is told by Dr. Michael Reynolds, a wealthy, materialistic oncologist with a wife Victoria and daughter Calantha, that he is dying of abdominal cancer and has very little time left to live. Convinced that he can heal if he gets to Webster Skyhorse, a medicine man in Arizona he knew when he was 8, Blue kidnaps Michael, holding him at gunpoint, and forces him to drive them to a nearby garage where they switch cars. Blue seeks to find Dibé Nitsaa (one of the six mountain lakes sacred to the Navajo people), said to heal the wounds of anyone who swims in its waters. Michael, however, bemoans his capture to Blue, seeking help to anyone who he comes across and complaining that he is missing out on a dinner engagement for promotion as head of the oncology department. The two men are instantly at odds with each other, separated by their education, class, race, and two very different world views. Michael believes that modern medicine has all the answers to whatever ails human beings, while Blue believes in Native American spirituality which honors the spirit world, sacred places, and herbal medicine. En route to Arizona, Michael and Blue have a rough encounter with a group of bikers in a small town, and a chase pursues. Later, Michael is bitten by a rattlesnake but is quickly treated for it by Blue, without medical equipment. Back in Los Angeles, Victoria elicits a police manhunt, and the authorities then attempt to track the two men on their eastward journey. As Michael grows closer to his abductor, he comes to terms with a harbored childhood secret that had haunted him; he was forced to take the life of his older brother Jimmy, who was on his death bed and had asked a young Michael to pull the plug. As Blue's condition worsens, Michael resorts to illegal means to obtain the needed medicine by breaking into a hospital in Flagstaff. The next morning, the two enter the Navajo reservation, but spot a police cruiser parked ahead of them. To escape, Michael drives off the main road and blends in with a cattle herd, becoming unnoticed in the dust kickup. Eluding the authorities and finally committed to helping Blue on his quest, Michael manages to whisk Blue up the mountain. Meanwhile, a police helicopter spots their car parked nearby. Reaching the top, Blue is reunited with Skyhorse, who directs him to the lake. Michael and Blue embrace, and the two part ways. As the helicopter spots Michael, Blue runs toward the lake, before mystically disappearing into its waters. Back in L.A., Michael, escorted by the police and wearing handcuffs, is reunited with his family.",

His mother, Mireille is crying and his widower grandfather, Victor, tells the boy that his father, Ivan, is dead. The next day, Alex, Justin's uncle and Ivan's little brother, arrives for the funeral accompanied by a woman, Juliette. Justin notice the tension between people. He takes his father's gun and hides it. The story flashes backward and forward to explain what led up to Ivan's death. Alex, who has rebelled against his family by becoming a cop, works in the deprived La Duchere district of Lyon. He begins with his encounter, a year before Ivan's death, when he first meets Juliette, who is brought to his office when she was arrested for shoplifting. He lets her off. He sees her again one day when he visits the sleazy nightclub run by his big brother, Ivan. Ivan is a crime boss and runs a popular club with a drag revue, funding his business through a stolen-auto ring headed up by Jimmy, who is Juliette's brother. The encounter between the siblings on opposite sides of the law is tense, they barely get along. Ivan is happy to show Alex that he is doing much better than him on the wrong side of the law. After their second encounter Alex and Juliette start a tortured affair beginning to meet regularly for sex. He is not in love with her, and their relationship is complicated by the girl's emotional and sexual involvement with Marie, a professor of philosophy. Alex spies on Marie. Ivan hears about Juliette's relationship with Alex and threatens her. Ivan and his gang, including Juliette, plan the theft of cars in a railway deposit. The heist at the railway marshaling yard goes disastrously wrong when Ivan is shot dead, along with a security guard.

    "film_title": "Three Lives and Only One Death",
    "Synopsis": "Pierre Bellemare, a French radio personality appears to recount four strange, seemingly non-coexisting, tales that make up the complex narrative structure of Three Lives and Only One Death. In the first tale we are introduced to Andre Parisi, a family man who has woken up with a terrible headache. Andre leaves to a local cafe where he meets one of the multiple enigmatic central characters, Matteo Strano (Marcello Mastroianni). Matteo offers Andre champagne and 1000 francs to listen to his story. Prior to the scene of Matteo's own storytelling, he reveals he was once married to Andre's wife. Matteo recounts the day he went out, on a whim, and rented out an apartment. Matteo insists this apartment is inhabited by fairies who eat time and who ultimately devoured 20 years of his life in one night. Matteo uses the story of his “strange journey in time” to entice Andre into going to his “fairy house.” Andre accepts Matteo's request and is surprised to find that the apartment actually exists. Matteo takes Andre's fondness for the apartment as an acceptance of a deal that allows Matteo to go home, leaving Andre to remain in the bewitched apartment. When Andre refuses to take Matteo's place “he finds himself with a hammer in his head, thus retrospectively explaining his headache as a premonition.” Both Tanya/Maria and Vickers once again reverse back to their roles as Prostitute and as beggar. Bellemare opens the third tale with an announcement about the foundation of the tale, that of which “extreme happiness is an extreme form of misery and excessive generosity is an excessive form of tyranny.” Bellemare also proclaims that the next story is “so true it has taken place not once, but several times.” This third tale which revolves around a young Parisian couple, Cecile and Martin, in love sets the stage for the “crossing between the stories and roles played by Mastroianni.\" The young couple receives a mysterious weekly gift of 2,000 francs in their mailbox and proceed with their perfect happy life. Both Cecile and Martin “embark on affairs out of kindness.” Cecile cheats on Martin with the next door neighbor, Piotr, a college student who cannot bear to hear the couples \"all-consuming\" love for each other. Martin unknowingly finds employment with Cecile's mother, Maria from the first tale; they too have an affair. However, the young couple forgives one another. The stories from earlier begin to collide in a seemingly rapid pace. Cecile takes a job working for the businesswoman Tanya/Maria. Later, Tanya/Maria and her ex-husband attempt to entice the young couple into perverse games, but they throw the idea out when they notice the young couple isn't sexy. One day the couple doesn't receive their regular earnings in the mailbox, due to the fact that their “protector” has died. However, their protector remembers them in his will and leaves to them the possession of a Mansion and its butler. The butler, another character played by Mastroianni, responds only to the sound of a bell. The butler plays odd games with the couple, who are now expecting a child. The butler hides the bell and drugs them into sleeping for days on end. One strange night Martin finds the Butler conversing with a businessman and a “tramp.” The tramp leaves Martin bloodied and dazed. This leads to the couple's immediate departure. Their inability to recognize Mastroianni as proprietor and butler results in him claiming the couple's new-born child, which he later leaves on Maria's door steps. In the final tale Bellemare introduces Luc Allamand, a successful businessman in his 70s. Luc receives a surprising phone call, in the middle of the night, detailing the arrival of his ex-wife, daughter and sister. Luc is taken aback by the news because they do not exist, he invented them for business reasons. Feeling ill Luc returns home and finds his wife, “a 32-year-old star singer in the hands of her accompanist.” Carlos's voice can be distinctly heard whispering, this appears to turn Luc into a sleepwalker. Luc then wanders aimlessly and returns to Maria and his former home as Matteo, once again as if nothing had happened. Mastroianni's multiples identities begin to cross at a more rapid pace. Maria supposedly awakes Matteo, but instead hears Vickers talking in his sleep about Negative Anthropology. Maria then confronts Matteo about his “mistress” Tanya/Maria. The sudden sound of a bell brings triggers Vickers the beggar. His begging nearly turns violent, but Maria is able to find a coin in time to reverse Vickers back to Matteo. That same day Mastroianni's characters return to their former residences. Meanwhile, all the women in his life have been receiving threatening letters. Luc returns to his office where he meets with a famous psychologist Luca Agusta, who congratulates Luc for inventing three women that now exist. After awakening from a bad dream Luc heads to a river where he is confronted by Carlos. In the meantime, all the women in his life rendezvous at a cafe where they encounter all of Mastroianni's characters. All of the identities become murderous and converge in the cafe, resulting in a series of deaths.",

    "Synopsis": "George Schober, his wife Anna, their son Georgie, and their dog Rolfi arrive at their lakefront holiday home in Austria. On the drive over, they spot their next-door neighbors Fred and Eva Berlinger accompanied by two young Viennese men whom they do not recognize. The Schobers notice the strange behavior displayed by the Berlingers and the apparent absence of their daughter Sissi. Fred visits minutes later with one of the men, whom he introduces as Paul, the son of a friend. Shortly after the family settles in, and while George is still setting up the boat, the other young unidentified man comes to Anna's kitchen to borrow eggs on Eva's behalf. This man, later named as Peter, gradually overstays his welcome by breaking successive batches of eggs and knocking the family's phone into the kitchen sink water, all seemingly done by accident. Paul arrives shortly thereafter and decides to try one of George's golf clubs, taking Anna's permission for granted. While Paul is outside with the club, George hears Rolfi's constant barking suddenly come to a whining halt. When it is clear that Peter and Paul are insidiously imposing themselves on Anna's courtesy, she demands that the men leave. George arrives and tries to eject them from the premises as well. Peter then breaks George's leg with the latter's golf club. Paul reveals he has killed Rolfi, and taunts Anna with a cruel searching game (during which he turns around and winks at the camera) until she finds the dog's corpse. It soon becomes evident that the two men have taken the family hostage. Neighbors Gerda and Robert arrive at the family's dock on a boat. Paul escorts Anna to greet them. Anna finds herself forced to introduce Paul as a family friend and to provide false excuses for George's absence, but she also tells Gerda that they may come over after dinner. Over the following hours, Peter and Paul subject the family to sadistic games. Paul, the more eloquent of the two, punctuates the torture with frequent breaks in the fourth wall and warped role-playing wherein he relates contradictory stories of Peter's past and ridicules his weight and apparent lack of intelligence. No explanation of the men's origins or motives is offered, and even their names may be pseudonyms since they also call each other Tom and Jerry and Beavis and Butt-Head on occasion. Paul places a bet that the family will not survive until 9:00 in the morning. He then puts a pillowcase over Georgie's head and pressures George to ask Anna to undress. She complies, only to be told to put her clothes back on. Georgie eventually flees to Fred's house, where he finds Sissi's corpse. He is cornered in the house and attempts to shoot Paul but the shotgun is unloaded. Paul returns Georgie to the home, bringing the shotgun and ammunition with him. Peter plays a counting-out game between family members while Paul makes sandwiches in the kitchen. Georgie panics and runs, which results in Peter shooting him dead. Paul berates Peter for being trigger-happy, and the two men decide to leave. George and Anna grieve their loss but eventually resolve to survive. Anna flees the house while George, with a broken leg, tries to repair the malfunctioning phone. Anna strives to find help, but ominously flags down the wrong car. Peter and Paul capture her and return to the house. During another sadistic game, Anna grabs the shotgun and kills Peter; however, Paul finds and uses a remote control to rewind Funny Games itself, effectively \"reversing\" the events that just happened, preventing Peter's death from happening. Paul then shoots George and both men take Anna out on the family's boat early the next morning. Around 8:00, Paul nonchalantly pushes the bound Anna into the water to drown, thus winning their bet. The two men casually continue a conversation, started off-screen, about a science fiction plot mainly known to Peter and seemingly relevant to both; the degree to which the plot is fictional to the two men, rather than coincident with their level of reality, is left unexplained. They arrive at Gerda's house and knock on the door, asking for some eggs. Paul turns around and throws a knowing glance towards the audience.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1953, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) aims to improve its public image following decades of corruption. Career-focused sergeant Edmund Exley lives in the shadow of his legendary detective father, whose murderer was never identified; Exley names the suspect \"Rollo Tomasi,” representing any criminal who escapes justice. Fame-seeking narcotics sergeant Jack Vincennes collaborates with tabloid journalist Sid Hudgens to perform high-profile celebrity arrests, and volatile officer Wendell White uses violence to interrogate and intimidate suspects, particularly women-abusers, because his father murdered his mother. On Christmas Eve, White encounters high-class prostitutes Lynn Bracken and Susan Lefferts, and former officer Leland Meeks. They work for Pierce Patchett, a millionaire businessman operating Fleur-de-Lis, a clandestine prostitution ring hosting women surgically altered to resemble film stars. White begins a relationship with Bracken. Following the \"Bloody Christmas\" scandal—involving drunken officers beating inmates—Exley is promoted to detective lieutenant after persuading his superiors to save the department's reputation by only prosecuting securely pensioned officers. Exley coerces Vincennes to testify, while White refuses to comply and is suspended. White's partner Dick Stensland is fired for his involvement, making other officers hostile towards Exley. Following the imprisonment of powerful gangster Mickey Cohen, police captain Dudley Smith recruits White to frighten off criminals attempting to take Cohen's place. A spate of murders targeting Cohen's underlings leads to the disappearance of of his heroin. Exley investigates a massacre at the Nite Owl coffee house, with Stensland and Lefferts among the victims. Three African American felons are arrested for the crime, and interrogation reveals the men have been raping a captive woman. White rushes to free the woman and executes her captor, planting evidence to suggest he acted in self-defense. The African-Americans escape the station and are killed by Exley in the ensuing shootout, closing the case and earning him a medal for bravery. However, unable to ignore inconsistencies in the case, Exley and White continue the investigation independently. White interviews Lefferts's mother and discovers Meeks's body beneath her house. He interrogates Cohen's ex-bodyguard, Johnny Stompanato, who reveals Meeks was trying to sell the stolen heroin. Hudgens and Vincennes orchestrate a homosexual tryst between struggling actor Matt Reynolds and district attorney Ellis Loew to create blackmail photos. However, after Reynolds is found murdered, a guilt-ridden Vincennes joins Exley's investigation. Vincennes learns that Meeks and Stensland formerly worked together under Smith, and dropped an investigation into Patchett and Hudgens blackmailing prominent businessmen with photos of their illicit trysts. He then confronts Smith, who shoots him dead. With his last breath, Vincennes says \"Rollo Tomasi.\" Exley becomes suspicious when Smith asks him about \"Rollo Tomasi\", a name Exley disclosed only to Vincennes. Smith arranges for White to find photos taken by Hudgens of Bracken having sex with Exley. Enraged, White confronts and fights Exley until they realize that their investigations implicate Smith. They deduce that Stensland killed Meeks for the heroin, and Smith orchestrated the Nite Owl massacre to kill Stensland and framed the African-Americans. Exley and White interrogate Loew, discovering Smith and Patchett are taking over Cohen's empire and used the photos of him with Reynolds to coerce his cooperation. Exley and White later find Hudgens and Patchett murdered. Smith lures Exley and White into a remote ambush. Though badly wounded, the pair kill Smith's men. Smith offers to mislead the approaching police and further promote Exley, but Exley executes him to prevent him avoiding punishment. Despite Exley's evidence, LAPD officials decide to protect the department's image by claiming Smith died a hero; Exley agrees to cooperate as a second \"hero\" for further accolades. Outside city hall, Exley says goodbye to Bracken and White before they leave for Arizona.",

    "Synopsis": "In a working-class part of South East London live Raymond; his wife, Valerie; little daughter Michelle; brother-in-law, Billy; mother-in-law, Janet; and grandmother-in-law, Kathy. Billy is a drug addict. He hangs out with his heroin-addict friends and they shoot up together. The family is dysfunctional, mostly because of Raymond's fiery temper and violent outbursts. When Valerie gets pregnant again, she continues to smoke and drink. One night, they score drugs and Billy uses Ray's cocaine. Ray is livid and bites Billy's nose and throws him out of the flat. Billy breaks back in and steals a family heirloom to pay for his drug habit. Valerie goes out on the town, and when Ray sees an attractive male friend of hers, he flies into a jealous rage, ordering her out of the pub and into the car. Back home, he accuses her of sleeping with the male friend, and brutalizes her severely, causing her to miscarry. He tries to win her back, but she leaves him and prepares to start a new life without him. In an alcohol-fuelled rage, he angrily tears their flat apart. He tells Mark, his friend, that the reason for his horrible behavior is his own abusive father, who was the same way with him and his mother. Later, he tries to reconcile with Valerie, but she is outraged, and says that when she reaches 70, she wants to look back on this part of her life, as she is now 30, as a time when she had some fun. What she has, instead, is people feeling sorry for her. Valerie does not want to return to Ray, pointing out they have not got a home to go back to because he has smashed it all up. She will try to find someone to be with who will love her and treat her kindly. Ray goes to see Valerie and asks her if she still loves him. Ray and Valerie are eventually back together again, and Ray has fixed up the flat. Ray speaks as crudely as ever, but seems to be restraining himself from his usual angry outbursts. Billy and his friend Danny rob a man to support their drug habit, and wind up going to prison. This not only reunites Ray with Valerie, but also reunites the whole family. They go off to visit Billy.",

    "Synopsis": "Badii, a middle-aged man, drives through Tehran looking for someone to do a job for him, for which he offers a large sum of money. During his drives with prospective candidates, Badii reveals that he plans to kill himself and has already dug the grave. He tells the people he is soliciting to go to the spot he has chosen the next morning, and either help him up if he has chosen to live or bury him if he has chosen to die. He does not discuss why he wants to commit suicide. His first recruit is a young, shy Kurdish soldier who refuses to do the job and flees from Badii's car. His second recruit is an Afghan seminarist who also declines because he has religious objections to suicide. The third is Bagheri, an Azeri taxidermist. He is willing to help Badii because he needs the money for his sick child. He tries to convince Badii not to commit suicide and reveals that he too wanted to commit suicide in 1960 but chose to live when, after failing in his attempt, he tasted mulberries which dropped from a tree. Bagheri reveals that he then went home with the mulberries and gave them to his wife, who enjoyed them. He continues to discuss what he perceives to be the beauty of life, including sunrises, the moon, and stars. Bagheri promises to throw dirt on Badii if he finds him dead in the morning. Badii drops him back at his workplace but suddenly runs back to meet him, requesting that in the morning Bagheri should confirm if he is actually dead by throwing some stones at him and jolting him awake in case he is asleep. That night, Badii lies in his grave while a thunderstorm begins. After a long blackout, the film ends by breaking the fourth wall with camcorder footage of Kiarostami and the film crew filming Taste of Cherry, leaving Badii's choice unknown.",

After being released from prison, he opens a barber shop and brings along a pet eel that he talks to while mostly ignoring conversation with others. He helps save Keiko Hattori (Misa Shimizu) from a suicide attempt, resulting in her working at the shop.

Takuro recognizes the local garbageman from prison, and the garbageman starts to stalk Takuro and Keiko, believing that Takuro isn't repentant enough for his crimes. He attempts to rape Keiko and leaves a letter revealing Takuro's past on the door of his barber shop, but it is removed by Takada. Keiko finds out that she is pregnant with the baby of Eiji Dojima (Tomorowo Taguchi), a loan shark, and that it is too late for an abortion. One night, the garbageman goes to Takuro's shop and lectures him, accusing him of killing his wife out of jealousy. The two get into an altercation and Takuro fends him off. Keiko goes back to her old company, where she is the vice-president, and retrieves her mother's bankbook. This results in Dojima angrily going to the barber shop, along with henchmen, and accusing her of theft since he was planning to reinvest the funds into his business.

    "Synopsis": "In 1973, two families in an affluent Connecticut suburb experiment with adultery and substance abuse over one Thanksgiving weekend. One family, the Hoods, consists of parents Ben and Elena and their children, Paul and Wendy. Ben is dissatisfied with his marriage and his career. The other family, Jim and Janey Carver and their sons, Mikey and Sandy, are the Hoods' neighbors and friends. Ben is having an affair with Janey to deal with his midlife dissatisfaction. His wife, Elena, is also bored with her life and looking to bring some excitement back, but is unsure how to do so. Young Wendy Hood enjoys sexual games with the Carver boys and with her school peers. Paul Hood has fallen for Libbets Casey, a classmate at the boarding school he attends, though his roommate Francis is also interested in her. Ben thinks Mikey Carver is odd and withdrawn, while Sandy, the younger one, experiments with dangerous objects like toy explosives. When Janey does not show up for a tryst one day, Ben accuses her of losing interest in the affair. Janey reasons she can't put the tasks and errands of her own family on hold for him. On the Friday night after Thanksgiving, the Hoods have an argument when Elena realizes her husband is having an affair with Janey. Despite the tension between them, the couple goes ahead with plans to attend a neighborhood party. Jim and Janey Carver also attend. It turns out to be a \"key party\", in which married couples swap sexual partners through each woman selecting from a bowl a set of car keys contributed by each man. Ben drinks increasingly as the party progresses. When Janey chooses the keys of a younger man, a drunken Ben becomes agitated and trips on the floor. After being helped up, he retreats to the bathroom to sober up, remaining there for the rest of the evening. Meanwhile, a winter storm begins to descend upon the neighborhood. The other key party participants pair off and leave until only Jim and Elena remain. She retrieves Jim's keys from the bowl and returns them to him. After debating the issue, Jim and Elena leave together, engaging in a quick, clumsy sexual encounter in the front seat of Jim's car. Jim, regretting the line they just crossed, offers to drive Elena home. Wendy makes her way to the Carvers' to see Mikey, but he has ventured out into the ice storm. She finds Sandy, who has a crush on her, alone at home. She asks Sandy to climb into bed with her, and they remove their clothing. They drink from a bottle of vodka, and after Sandy proclaims his love for Wendy, they fall asleep together. Paul is invited to Libbets's Manhattan apartment, but upon arriving, he is disappointed to learn that Francis was also invited. Throughout the night, the trio drinks beer and listens to music. Francis and Libbets also take prescription pills found in Libbets's mother's medicine cabinet. Paul confesses his feelings for Libbets, and in her stupor, she tells Paul she thinks of him as a brother. Paul leaves Libbets and Francis passed out in the apartment and just barely makes the train back to New Canaan. Meanwhile, Mikey, out walking in the storm, is enchanted by the beauty of the trees and fields covered in ice. He slides down an icy hill and sits on a guardrail. A moment later, a falling tree takes down a power line, which connects with the guardrail, fatally electrocuting him. Jim and Elena also get stuck due to fallen trees and return to the Carvers' house as dawn breaks. Elena walks in on her daughter in bed with Sandy and tells Wendy to get dressed. Janey has also returned home but is curled up in bed in the fetal position, still wearing her party dress. A sober Ben is driving back to his house when he discovers Mikey's body on the side of the road. He carries the body to the Carvers' house, and the two families are drawn together in grief. Wendy hugs the shocked and numbed Sandy in an attempt to comfort him. Jim is devastated, while Janey remains asleep, not yet knowing the news. Ben, Elena, and Wendy later drive to New Canaan station to pick up Paul, whose train was delayed by the power outage. Once all four are together in the car, Ben breaks down and sobs uncontrollably at the wheel as Elena comforts him, and the kids look on.",

    "Synopsis": "Thomas Smithers (Postlethwaite), who has made his fortune as an ironmonger and cannon-maker, hires the famous Meneer Chrome (McGregor) to create the most extravagant garden imaginable on his overgrown property. Smithers doesn't know that his wife's cousin Fitzmaurice (Grant) has already hired Chrome, with the goal of bankrupting Smithers and essentially acquiring Juliana, whom he loves. Juliana, however, is attracted to Chrome and he in turn to the Smithers' daughter, Anna, who filters all experiences through a volume of Andrew Marvell's poems that she is never without. Her parents, thinking her mentally unstable, subject her to numerous \"treatments\" that prompt Chrome's compassion. As the garden grows increasingly complex and Smithers approaches bankruptcy, Fitzmaurice realizes that Chrome's affection for Anna makes him a liability; he threatens to reveal some damaging information about Chrome and then decides to kill him, but his plan backfires and Fitzmaurice dies. Juliana decides to remain loyal to her husband, now bankrupt from his obsession with the garden project. Chrome, revealed as an imposter (the assistant to the actual Chrome), goes to the sea with Anna, where she throws away her book of poetry.",

    "Synopsis": "In the small town of Sam Dent, British Columbia, a school bus hits a patch of ice, runs through a barrier, and crashes into a lake, killing 14 children. The grieving parents are approached by an out-of-town lawyer, Mitchell Stephens, who is haunted by his dysfunctional relationship with his drug-addicted daughter. Stephens persuades the reluctant parents and bus driver Dolores Driscoll to file a class-action lawsuit against the town and bus company for damages, arguing that the accident is a result of negligence in constructing the barrier or the bus. The case depends on coaching the few surviving witnesses to say the right things in court, particularly Nicole Burnell, a 15-year-old paralyzed from the waist down as a result of the accident. Before the accident, Nicole was an aspiring musician and was being sexually abused by her father, Sam. One bereft parent, Billy Ansel, distrusts Stephens and pressures Sam to drop the case; Nicole overhears their argument. In the pretrial deposition, Nicole unexpectedly accuses the bus driver Dolores of speeding, halting the lawsuit. Stephens and Sam know she is lying but can do nothing. Two years later, Stephens sees Dolores working as a bus driver in a city.",

    "film_title": "Welcome to Sarajevo",
    "Synopsis": "In 1992, ITN reporter Michael Henderson travels to Sarajevo, the besieged capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, during the ongoing war. There, he meets American star journalist Jimmy Flynn on the chase for the most exciting stories and pictures. Henderson and Flynn have friendly discussions and differences in the intervals between reporting. They stay at the Holiday Inn, which was the primary hotel for the press in Sarajevo during the siege. After a previous translator proves corrupt and inept, ITN hires Risto Bavić to be Henderson's translator. Their work permits them harrowing and unobstructed views of the suffering of the people of Sarajevo. The situation changes when Henderson makes a report from Ljubica Ivezic, an orphanage located on the front lines, in which two hundred children live in desperate conditions. After increasingly indiscriminate attacks fail to make the lead story in the United Kingdom, Henderson makes the orphanage his lead story to try to bring full attention to the war and encourage the evacuation of the children to safety. When American aid worker Nina organizes a UN-sanctioned bus-borne evacuation of Sarajevan children to Italy, Henderson convinces her to include Emira, a Bosniak girl from the orphanage, to whom Henderson had made a promise to evacuate. Nina knows this is an illegal act, only transfers to relatives abroad have been authorised, but the orphanage director allows it because of the desperate circumstances. Henderson and his cameraman accompany the evacuation under the pretense of covering it as a news story. However, Bosnian Serbs hinder the evacuation at several points along its route. In the final harassment, armed Chetniks halt the bus, select and forcibly disembark the Bosnian Serb orphans, identifying them through their first names, and take them away on their lorry, as they refuse to let them go to the West. Henderson makes it home to London with Emira, adopting her into his family. After several months, Henderson receives word from a former producer in Sarajevo that Emira's estranged mother wants her back. Henderson, who didn't know that her mother was living, returns to Sarajevo, now driven not only by the siege but also by organised crime, and seeks out Risto, who has become a Bosnian soldier. Henderson asks him to help find Emira's mother. They discover from a relative that Emira was put into the orphanage as an infant by her mother under familial pressure. When Risto is killed in his home by a sniper, Henderson asks for help from Zeljko, a concierge at the Holiday Inn, who Henderson had helped in the past. Zeljko negotiates the streets and road-blocks that lead to Emira's mother, who is desperate for the girl to live with her. However, she is persuaded that Emira is happy in England and so signs the adoption papers. A running joke in the movie is the designation by a UN official that Sarajevo was only the 14th worst crisis in the world. In the middle of the movie, Harun, a cellist friend of Risto, says that he would play a concert on the streets of Sarajevo once it is designated the worst place on Earth. Though he acknowledges the danger, he claims that \"the people will die happily listening to my music.\" The movie ends with Harun holding a \"concert of peace\" on a hill overlooking Sarajevo, playing his cello to hundreds of Sarajevans. Among the attendees are Henderson, Flynn and several children from the orphanage. Henderson gives Harun a sad smile; the concert is beautiful, but it also means that Sarajevo had, indeed, become the worst place on Earth. The closing credits say that Emira still lives in England.",

    "Synopsis": "Claire Dolan is an Irish immigrant in America and a sex worker. She does not enjoy the profession at all, but owes her pimp money and must continue to work. She goes to neighboring Newark, New Jersey, where she has a cousin. She takes a job in a salon and forms a relationship with her cousin and Siobhan. Before long, she begins to receive suspicious phone calls; at work, she is called to the phone and when she answers there is no one on the line. At home in the middle of the night she receives another call. After hanging up, the phone rings again. She feels unsafe, that perhaps Roland has found her, and so she leaves her apartment and walks to a nearby bar. As soon as she walks in, she sits down at a man's table, asking if he is waiting for someone. When he says no, she asks him to dance with her. Claire and Elton dance for a few hours and we next see her waking up in his bed the next morning. It is apparent that she picked up someone to take her home with them, for a safe place to spend the night. When she arrives home, she feels something is out of place. He watches her speak to someone (Roland), then follows her to a hotel where she stays for quite some time, then gives up waiting. At Dolan's apartment, there is a knock on her door. Elton confronts her about who she really is, where she lives, and asks if she has a pimp and if she owes him any money. Over the next few days/weeks, they go to work and meet afterward. Elton has feelings for her, and the two confess their love to each other. Elton goes to see Roland, who has been expecting him. Roland grabs the other man by the throat and tells him Claire always was and always will be a whore and that he should get out while he can. It is implied she may be his own daughter. He also speaks with an Eastern European prostitute in a hotel room, but seems uninterested in having sex with her, and asks her some questions. He returns to the city. Claire has gone to the doctor and checks out okay. She continues to see a few clients, but during one visit, she thinks she sees Elton's reflection on the balcony outside and goes to the window, cracking it to look out. Her client comes into the room and has her leave it open for the air, and they carry on, with Elton on the balcony. Now having enough money to pay off her debt, she goes to pay off Roland. He asks her if she is going to keep her baby, then congratulates her, offering her a packet of money \"for the baby\" but she refuses. He insists, but she continues to refuse his money as it would be something Roland could hold over her in the future. She goes home, packs a suitcase with an air of finality, and goes to the airport. Elton is walking down the street with a blond woman when Roland passes by and stops him to say hello. Elton introduces the woman as his wife, and she and Roland talk for a moment. She is seven months pregnant with a girl.",

    "film_title": "Class Trip",
    "Synopsis": "The story begins with Nicolas, a shy and introverted ten years old, dreading the school ski trip. Nicolas is worried that he won't fit in with the other boys. His overprotective father decides to drive Nicolas by himself to the ski resort, instead of letting him go on a bus with the rest of the group. En route, Nicolas and his father pass the aftermath of an apparently fatal car accident. Seeing police ahead while the traffic had stopped, Nicolas' father becomes nervous and conceals all loose items within the car in the trunk – and we see that Nicolas' travel bag is next to several matching briefcases. Nicolas subsequently forgets his bag in his father's car, increasing his awkwardness when he shows up for the class trip without any spare clothes or toiletries. The father does not return to bring Nicolas's bag, and is not reachable when the school staff tries to get in touch with him. Nicolas subsequently has disturbing daydreams about his father having been in a car accident. During the trip, Nicolas is befriended by Hodkann, another pupil. Nicolas fabricates a story for Hodkann, falsely claiming that his father is a secret agent, and that bad guys are out to get him. He makes Hodkann promise not to tell anyone. One of Nicolas' main fears is wetting his bed, and the situation gets worse when he gets a bed just above Hodkann, also having borrowed his pyjamas since he didn't have his own. At night, Nicolas tries to stay awake but falls asleep, waking up from a wet dream but believing he has wet his pants. He leaves his bed to clean his clothes and while returning he discovers it is snowing outside. Nicolas goes out into the freezing cold and ends up locked out, and in desperation curls up inside the car of his ski instructor, Patrick. Before he drifts off to sleep he sees a van driving away. He is found in the morning by Patrick and is taken in to a study with a fever. Later that day, he goes to a café while the other boys are skiing. While in the café, police come looking for René, a young boy who is missing. That night, while sleeping he has a nightmare. He dreams that he is at a theme park with Hodkann and Patrick and that he goes on a giant caterpillar while his little brother is looked after by another seemingly friendly man. Once he is on the caterpillar he sees his brother being walked to a white van by the stranger. Later, the brother is found outside the park after having one of his organs taken. The dream is poignant because Nicolas, months before, had not been allowed to go on a similar ride because it would have meant leaving his little brother with a stranger. After declining the stranger's offer to watch the brother, Nicolas' father awkwardly warns him against stranger danger, claiming this includes a risk of organ theft. In a series of flashbacks, Nicolas' father shows signs of mental instability: his wrist notably shows a deep scar that indicates a previous suicide attempt. It is eventually revealed that Nicolas' father was not in a car accident as Nicolas had day dreamed, but rather that he abducted and abused children, likely including the boy the police were looking for, and has been arrested. Hodkann, who broke his promise to Nicolas not to tell anyone about his father supposedly being a secret agent, actually described the father's car to the police when they came to investigate the boy's disappearance, thinking this would help the father escape the \"bad guys\". Ironically, this helped the police connect the father with the boy's disappearance, and led to his arrest. The movie ends with Nicolas being driven to his mother's home by Patrick, who has been made aware of the father's arrest, but declines to tell Nicolas about it, simply informing him that something terrible has happened and that it would be best if he would hear the news from his family. During the drive home, newspapers and TV stations are shown reporting on the story, and Patrick awkwardly tries to shield Nicolas from them.",

    "Synopsis": "Alexandros, a middle-aged writer, leaves his seaside apartment in Thessaloniki after learning he has a terminal illness and must enter a hospital the next day to perform more tests. He is trying to get his affairs in order and to find someone who would take care of his dog. He speaks in his mind to his dead wife, Anna, who appears still young to him. Alexandros hides a young Albanian squeegee kid from the police who are arresting other boys like him at a traffic stop in order to deport them. Later, he pays a visit to his 22-year-old daughter, but he does not tell her of his diagnosis. Instead he gives her some letters written by her mother, which she reads out loud, triggering his memories of the time when their daughter was a newborn at her baby shower. He learns that his daughter and her husband have sold the family's beach house without telling him. Also, they refuse to keep his dog with them. On his way back, Alexandros meets the immigrant boy again, and witnesses his capture at the hands of human traffickers who try to sell him into illegal adoption. Alexandros infiltrates the clandestine meeting and in a moment of confusion tries to sneak away with the kid but is stopped by the traffickers and must pay what they ask for him. He tries to put the kid on a bus and then a taxi, but he keeps running away, so he decides to take him across the border to Albania himself. Alexandros sees at the snowy mountain border an eerie barbed wire fence with what seem to be bodies stuck to it. As the pair waits for the gate to open, they have a change of mind about crossing, when the boy admits he has been lying about his life in Albania. The two of them barely escape a border sentry and make it back to Alexandros's automobile. The boy's perilous existence brings Alexandros out of his stupor and self-pity, and seemingly re-energizes him in his love for a 19th-century Greek poet, Dionysios Solomos, whose unfinished poem he longs to complete. The old man and the boy are connected by fear. The former over what lies ahead for him, and whether his life has had any impact; the latter over the perilous return trip to Albania on a path over the mountains lined with land mines, as well as traffickers. Alexandros pays a visit to his housekeeper, Ourania. She is manifestly smitten with him, but is in the middle of a wedding party and dances between her son and his bride. The scene plays on until Alexandros interrupts. He leaves the dog with her, and then the dance and music, which had stopped, resume as if nothing had halted them. The boy goes to the ruins of a hospital, mourning another young boy, Selim, via a candlelight vigil, with dozens of other youths. The pair take a bus trip and encounter all sorts of people, from a tired political protester to an arguing couple to a classical music trio. They also look out the window as a trio of people on bicycles pedal by them, oddly dressed in bright yellow raincoats. The boy departs in the middle of the night, stowing aboard a huge, brightly lit ship whose destination is unknown. Alexandros enters his old home. He looks about, exits out the back door, and into the sunny past where Anna and other friends are singing. They stop, ask him to join them, then they all dance, and soon, there is only the poet and his wife in motion. Then, she slowly pulls away, and he claims his hearing is gone. He also cannot see her, it seems. He calls out and asks how long tomorrow will be, after he had told her he refuses to go into the hospital as planned. She tells him tomorrow will last eternity and a day.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1971, Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo speed across the Mojave Desert. Duke, under the influence of mescaline, complains of a swarm of giant bats, and inventories their drug stash. They pick up a young hitchhiker and explain their mission: Duke has been assigned by a magazine to cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race in Las Vegas. They bought excessive drugs for the trip, and rented a red Chevrolet Impala convertible. The hitchhiker flees on foot at their behavior. Trying to reach Vegas before the hitchhiker can go to the police, Gonzo gives Duke part of a sheet of \"Sunshine Acid\" (ultra-purified LSD), then informs him that there is little chance of making it before the drug kicks in. By the time they reach the strip, Duke is in the full throes of his trip and barely makes it through the hotel check-in, hallucinating that the clerk is a moray eel and that his fellow bar patrons are draconian lizards. The next day, Duke arrives at the race and heads out with his photographer, Lacerda. Duke becomes irrational and believes that they are in the middle of a battlefield, so he fires Lacerda and returns to the hotel. After consuming more mescaline, as well as huffing diethyl ether, Duke and Gonzo arrive at the Bazooko Circus casino but leave shortly afterwards, the chaotic atmosphere frightening Gonzo. Back in the hotel room, Duke leaves Gonzo unattended, and tries his luck at Big Six. When Duke returns he finds that Gonzo, high on LSD, has trashed the room, and is in the bathtub clothed, attempting to pull the tape player in with him as he wants to hear the song better. He pleads with Duke to throw the machine into the water when the song \"White Rabbit\" peaks. Duke agrees, but instead throws a grapefruit at Gonzo's head before running outside and locking Gonzo in the bathroom. Duke attempts to type his reminiscences on hippie culture, and flashes back to San Francisco, 1965, where a hippie licks spilled LSD off his sleeve. The next morning, Duke awakens to an exorbitant room service bill and no sign of Gonzo (who has returned to Los Angeles while Duke slept), and attempts to leave town. As he nears Baker, California, a patrolman stops him for speeding, and advises him to sleep at a nearby rest stop. Duke instead heads to a payphone and calls Gonzo, learning that he has a suite in his name at the Flamingo Las Vegas so he can cover a district attorney's convention on narcotics. Duke checks into his suite, only to be met by an LSD-tripping Gonzo and a young girl called Lucy, who Gonzo explains has come to Las Vegas to meet Barbra Streisand, and that this was her first LSD trip. Duke convinces Gonzo to ditch Lucy in another hotel before her trip wears off. Gonzo accompanies Duke to the convention, and the pair discreetly snort cocaine as the guest speaker delivers a comically out-of-touch speech about \"marijuana addicts\" before showing a brief film. Unable to take it, Duke and Gonzo flee back to their room, only to discover that Lucy has called. Their trips mostly over, Gonzo deals with Lucy over the phone (pretending that he is being savagely beaten by thugs) as Duke attempts to mellow out by trying some of Gonzo's stash of adrenochrome. Duke has a bad reaction to the drugs and is reduced to an incoherent mess before he blacks out. After an unspecified amount of time passes, Duke wakes up to a complete ruin of the once pristine suite. After discovering his tape recorder, he attempts to remember what has happened. As he listens, he has brief memories of the general mayhem that has taken place, including Gonzo threatening a waitress at a diner, himself convincing a distraught cleaning woman that they are police officers investigating a drug ring, and attempting to buy an orangutan. Duke drops Gonzo off at the airport, driving right up to the airplane, before returning to the hotel one last time to finish his article. He then speeds back to Los Angeles.",

    "film_title": "Flowers of Shanghai",
    "Synopsis": "The film is set in the elegant brothels of Shanghai, called Changsan Shuyu ( ; \"Flower Houses\"), in 1884. The story is about the prostitutes in these houses, known as \"shi sen\" or \"flower girls,\" who are top-notch prostitutes, depicting in great detail their relationships with the wealthy patrons, which are semi-monogamous and often last for a long period of time, and the daily activities in the houses. The main prostitutes in the film are Crimson, Jasmin, Jade, Pearl and Emerald. Crimson belongs to the Huifang Enclave ( ), while Jasmin works at the East Hexing Enclave ( ). Jade and her friend Pearl work in the Gongyang Enclave ( ), and Emerald resides in the Shangren Enclave ( ). The film explores the relationships between the wealthy patrons and the prostitutes. Master Wang leaves the prostitute Crimson at the end of their \"four-or-five\" year relationship after he is refused her hand in marriage. He falls for the younger prostitute Jasmin, angering Crimson. However, Master Wang still has feelings for Crimson. When he finds out she is having an affair with an actor, he launches into a drunken rage. He agrees to marry Jasmin and departs for Guangdong after receiving a promotion. It is later revealed in conversation between other characters that Jasmin had an affair with Wang's nephew. Another prostitute, Jade, has been given a promise by her lover, the young and immature Master Zhu, that if they cannot be married together, they will die together. When it is apparent that the marriage will not occur, she gives Zhu opium in an attempt to poison him before attempting to drink opium herself. Emerald yearns for freedom from life in a brothel and is supported by Luo, one of her patrons. As a child, she was bought for $100 by her auntie who insists that freedom costs many times that value ($3,000); the negotiation goes on throughout the film. With the help of Master Hong and Luo, Emerald negotiates a satisfactory price and achieves her independence. Regarding the English title of the film, the meaning of \"sing-song girls\" does not refer to singing girls who sing for a living. Eileen Chang's commentary on the Mandarin text makes it clear: \"Xiansheng\" or \"Xi sang\" in Wu is pronounced as \"sing song\". That is probably why the title is translated as \"sing-song girls\" - not the translation of \"singing girl\". The term \"singing girl\" was a new term from the late 1920s to the 1930s, after there were dancing girl.",

    "film_title": "Henry Fool",
    "Synopsis": "Socially inept garbageman Simon Grim lives a monotonous life with his sister Fay, unemployed, and his mother Mary, who suffers from severe depression. Henry Fool, who's on probation from prison for statutory rape, sets himself up in their basement and proceeds to impinge himself on their daily lives. Seeing Simon's interest in literature, Henry encourages him to write his thoughts in a notebook. Simon fills several notebooks with what turns out to be a poem and Henry encourages him to try to get it published, even though it is dismissed by many as pornographic and scatological. Simon meets with one publisher, Angus, supposedly a friend of Henry's. Angus rejects the manuscript and claims no knowledge of Henry; his secretary reveals that Henry worked in Angus' office as a janitor. Henry himself has a number of notebooks that he refers to as his Confession, a work that details his mysterious past and which he hopes to publish, although he won't let anyone read them. Meanwhile, Henry inflicts his hedonistic manner on all those around him, ultimately impregnating Fay, after which Henry and Fay marry. At Henry's suggestion, Fay uploads verses from Simon's poem to the Internet, where it elicits worldwide controversy, attracting adoration from those who appreciate Simon as a transgressive genius and condemnation from conservative politicians who see his work as degenerate. Excited by the opportunity to profit from the poem, Angus approaches Simon again and, after negotiations, ultimately offers him $200,000 up front and a 60/40 royalty split to publish it. Henry is distressed over becoming a father, worried that the time spent working a job to support his family will conflict with his passions as a writer. In a gesture of gratitude for his help, Simon tells Henry he is going to insist Angus publish Henry's work as part of his contract. Henry finally allows Simon to read the notebooks; Simon dislikes the work, but brings it to Angus as promised. Angus hates the Confession and refuses to publish it, forcing Simon to reconsider his promise to Henry. As Fay gives birth to a son, Simon notifies Henry of Angus' refusal and reveals that he signed the contract anyway. The two men argue and Simon states he is going away. Henry is obviously distraught. Seven years pass. Henry has a job at the garbage company where Simon used to work, while Simon is living elsewhere and has just won the Nobel Prize in Literature. One evening, Henry is informed by a neighbor girl that her stepfather has beaten her mother again and indicates he's also been abusing her; she offers a sexual favor if Henry will kill him. When Henry stops by the neighbors' house to check on the mother, he's confronted by the drunken husband, who begins to beat Henry viciously; Henry kills the man in self-defense. Henry's past conviction, coupled with the accounting by the girl of her offer, makes him appear guilty. Henry and Fay's young son, Ned, finds Simon and brings him back to help Henry. Simon was supposed to be on his way to the airport to catch a flight to Stockholm to accept his Nobel Prize, but instead has his passport altered and gives it and his ticket to Henry. They arrive late for the flight but, due to Simon's prestige and mission, the airline holds the plane as a courtesy. The flight attendants anxiously hurry Henry (as Simon) along as he painfully limps towards the plane, but he pauses and looks back. The last shot is a closeup of Henry running with his luggage.",

    "Synopsis": "On the first day of the cold spring of 1953, two events occur, though they are not comparable in importance: Fireman Fedya Aramyshev is arrested, and \"the greatest leader of all times and peoples,\" Joseph Stalin, is found lying on the floor of his dacha. Some time before these incidents, we see events from the life of General Yuri Klensky, who serves in the military-medical service. In the Soviet Union, the Doctors' plot, in which a group of predominantly Jewish doctors is accused of conspiring to kill Stalin, is in full swing. Klensky, himself Jewish, attempts to console himself with near-constant drunkenness, hoping that Soviet justice will not reach him. However, a series of events suggests that Klensky's hopes are futile, and that his arrest is imminent. In an early scene, the general encounters his own double in the hospital, and later, a \"foreigner\" arrives at his home, bearing news about a relative who allegedly lives abroad. Suspecting a provocation, Klensky throws the \"foreigner\" down the stairs, but a local informant manages to report the doctor's contact with foreigners to the senior officers of the MGB in time. Klensky tries to escape but ends up getting arrested. His family is evicted and placed in a crowded communal apartment, and Klensky himself, after being detained, is left to the criminals, who brutally beat and rape him. But then a miracle happens: the bloodied general is driven directly from his cell to the countryside to treat a certain \"high-ranking\" patient. To Klensky's shock, this patient turns out to be the \"Great Leader.\" Stalin's condition is hopeless—he is dying, wheezing, and agonizing. Beria's voice, full of triumph, utters the first sentence of post-Stalinist Russia: \"Khrustalyov, My Car!\" Klensky is immediately released, but he does not return to medicine. Instead, the general \"goes to the people.\" At the end of the film, he is the commandant of a train. Drinking happily, he balances a glass of port on his shaved head.",

    "film_title": "Life Is Beautiful",
    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 to 700 words. --> ; Part I In 1939, in Fascist Italy, young Italian Jew Guido Orefice arrives to work in Arezzo, Tuscany, with his uncle Eliseo in a hotel restaurant. He is comical and sharp, and falls in love with the gentile girl Dora. Later, Guido sees her again in the city where she is a teacher and set to be engaged to Rodolfo, a rich but arrogant local government official with whom he regularly clashes. Guido sets up many \"coincidental\" incidents to show his interest in Dora. Eventually, Dora gives in to Guido's affection and promise. Guido steals her from her engagement party on Uncle Eliseo's horse, Robin Hood, humiliating Dora's fiancé and mother. They are later married, have a son, Giosuè, and run a bookstore. Dora's mother visits once, meeting her grandson. ; Part II In 1944, at the height of World War II, Nazi Germany occupies Northern Italy. Guido, his uncle Eliseo, and Giosuè are arrested on Giosuè's birthday. They and many other Italian Jews are forced onto a train bound for a concentration camp. After confronting a guard about her husband and son and being told there is no mistake, Dora insists on boarding the train to stay with her family. However, as men and women are separated in the camp, Dora never sees her family during their internment. Guido pulls off various stunts, such as hijacking the camp's loudspeaker to send messages, symbolic or literal, to Dora to assure her that he and Giosuè are safe. Eliseo is murdered in a gas chamber shortly after their arrival. Giosuè narrowly avoids being gassed himself as he hates to bathe, and did not follow the other children when they had been ordered to \"take a shower\". Guido consistently hides the true situation from Giosuè. He convinces him that the camp is a complicated game in which he must perform the tasks given to him. Each task earns them points and whoever reaches one thousand points first wins a tank. He is told that if he cries, complains for his mother, or says that he is hungry, he will lose points, while quiet boys who hide from the guards earn extra points. Giosuè is at times reluctant to go along with the game, but Guido continually encourages him. One day, Guido takes advantage of the appearance of visiting German officers and their families to show Giosuè that other children are hiding as part of the game. Then he tricks a German nanny into thinking Giosuè is one of her charges to feed him while Guido serves the German officers. Giosuè must stay quiet at all times for this part of the game and simply follow the other children, as he cannot speak German. Giosuè is almost exposed as a prisoner when he accidentally says \"thank you\" in Italian to another server at dinner. However, when the server returns with his superior, Guido provides a ruse by teaching all of the German children how to say \"thank you\" in Italian, saving Giosuè. Guido maintains this story through the end when, in the chaos of shutting down the camp as the Allied forces approach, he tells his son to stay hidden until everybody has left, the final task in the competition before the promised tank is his. Guido goes to find Dora but is caught by a German soldier. An officer orders his execution, so he is led off by the soldier. As he is walking to his death, Guido passes by Giosuè one last time and winks, still in character and playing the game. Guido is then shot dead in an alleyway. The next morning, Giosuè emerges from hiding, just as a U.S. Army unit led by a Sherman tank arrives and the camp is liberated. An overjoyed Giosuè, unaware of his father's death, believes he won the tank, and an American soldier allows him to ride with him on it. Giosuè soon spots Dora in the procession leaving the camp and reunites with her. While the young Giosuè excitedly tells his mother about how he had won a tank, just as his father had promised, the movie's narrator reveals himself as the adult Giosuè, reminiscing on the sacrifices his father made for him.",

    "Synopsis": "The film begins with Joe Kavanagh at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, relaying an experience from his past. On the way to pick up Liam, a former junkie whom Joe is fond of, for a football match, they are cut off by Sarah, a health visitor serving Liam, his girlfriend Sabine and their son Scott. Dropping off Liam after the match, Joe watches as Liam and Sabine have a confrontation outside their home with several thugs. He later spots Sarah outside a health center and flirts with her, offering to help her with her wallpaper. While at Sarah's, Joe spots a social worker taking photographs of him working, which violates his welfare policy. Joe grows enraged and threatens the social worker, attacking the car with his painting supplies. Later while eating dinner, Joe tells Sarah that he is a recovering alcoholic. Joe is called before social services to explain his alleged violation of welfare policy, where he learns that Sarah intervened on his behalf, saying he was working as a favour and not for money. Joe visits the health center to thank Sarah for intervening and asks her on a date. She is apprehensive about going on a date with Joe based on his strange behavior. After the date, Sarah locks her keys out of the flat and Joe suggests that she stay with him, stressing that he is not trying to sleep with her. Joe shares stories of his past with Sarah, and she presses him about why he stopped drinking. Joe is hesitant at first, but explains that he stopped drinking because he brutally beat a previous romantic partner while drunk. The next day at a football match, the same thugs who hassled Liam at home arrive at the pitch and assault him. Liam claims it was in retaliation for a bar fight, but Joe worries that he has relapsed on drugs. At the health center, Sabine causes a scene by refusing to put out her cigarette, and later captures Sarah's attention when she is caught stealing a prescription pad. At home, Liam confronts Sabine, who lied about where she has been, and accuses her of sleeping with other men after finding condoms in her purse. Later, Joe arrives to find Sabine preparing to inject heroin. He reluctantly helps her inject, and she says the thugs have taken Liam to drug dealer and crook McGowan, whom Joe knows from his youth. Liam tells Joe that he stopped dealing heroin when he went to prison, but that Sabine dealt drugs in his place and has begun using her own product, leading them to be in debt to McGowan. Liam tells Joe that McGowan's thugs have threatened to cripple him if he cannot repay the money. Joe threatens McGowan over this, but McGowan proposes that Joe deal drugs to repay Liam's debt. Joe and Liam return home, and he lies to Sarah that the matter has been sorted. After an intimate night with Sarah, Joe goes to Kintyre to pick up a car that is implied to contain drugs. In a later scene, Joe gives Sarah a pair of earrings and a ring, telling her that he loves her. Sarah responds that she does not want the ring and Joe cannot understand what he has done wrong, throwing the ring into the river in a fit of rage. Later, she arrives at his door and apologizes. Later, Sarah tells her co-worker Maggie that she is pregnant. Sarah meets with Sabine and Liam in a park, where Sabine inadvertently exposes Joe's lie about paying off McGowan. Liam complicates things further by telling Sarah that Joe simply got an extension on their payments, and Sarah accuses him of lying. She goes to Joe's flat and presses him for more information about his dealings with McGowan, expressing her concerns. Joe seems to have placated her, but Liam arrives abruptly and warns Joe about Sarah's questions. She is enraged that Joe is dealing drugs, but he insists that he lacks the same resources as her and had no other way to help Liam. Sarah leaves the apartment in tears after discovering her presents were bought with an advance from McGowan. Joe goes to Liam's flat and gives him money to leave town, saying he will not complete the second job for McGowan. After this, he goes to Sarah's but fails to reconcile with her. At McGowan's snooker hall, Joe says he will not complete the job. McGowan brushes him off and tries to get Joe thrown out. After one of McGowan's thugs makes lewd comments about Sarah, Joe flies into a rage and brutally beats up all of McGowan's men. Knowing he has marked himself for death, he buys liquor and returns home. Later, Liam arrives and finds Joe in a drunken stupor. He tells Joe that McGowan's men are after both of them, but Joe drunkenly insults Liam for not following his instructions and refuses to move. Backed into a corner, Liam ties a rope around his neck and jumps out of the window. Joe awakes and tries to pull him back up, but is too inebriated to lift Liam, who dies. Joe spots Sarah at Liam's burial and the two walk off together.",

    "Synopsis": "Helge, a respected businessman and family patriarch, is celebrating his 60th birthday at the family-run hotel. Gathered together amongst a large party of family and friends are his wife Else, his sullen eldest son Christian, his rude and arrogant younger son Michael, and his well-traveled daughter Helene. Another sibling, Linda, has recently taken her life at the hotel. Helene finds Linda's suicide note, but hides it in a medicine bottle after becoming upset by the undisclosed contents. Michael fights with his wife, whom he had earlier abandoned on the roadside with their three children, and then has sex with her. He later beats Michelle, a waitress at the hotel, after she pulls him aside to tell him that she is pregnant as a result of their affair. At Helge's birthday dinner, Christian makes a toast to his father. During the toast, he publicly accuses Helge of sexually abusing both him and his twin sister Linda as children. After an initial shocked silence, the party goes on as usual, with guests attempting to ignore what has happened. Helge pulls Christian aside to question him about his accusations. He questions his motives for slandering his father, and Christian appears to withdraw his accusation. However, Christian is spurred to further action by hotel chef Kim, a childhood friend who knows about the abuse. Kim orders Pia and Michelle to hide the guests' car keys. Christian then continues his toast by accusing Helge of causing Linda's death through the trauma of the abuse. Helge speaks to Christian alone and threatens to bring up his troubled personal history, including his impotence with women and Christian's possibly-incestuous relationship with Linda. Further exacerbating the tensions of the day, Helene's black boyfriend Gbatokai shows up, causing the racist Michael to lead most of the partygoers in singing the racist Danish song \"Jeg har set en rigtig negermand\", in order to offend him. Else later makes a toast where she makes insulting comments about her children, and accuses Christian of having an overactive imagination. She asks him to apologize for his earlier statements and accusations. Christian accuses Else of knowing about the abuse yet not intervening. Michael and two other guests eject Christian from the hotel. When Christian walks back in, they beat him and tie him to a tree in the woods outside the hotel. Christian unties himself and returns. Pia finds Linda's suicide note and gives it to Christian. Christian gives the note to Helene and she reads it aloud in front of the party guests. In the note, Linda states that she is overwhelmed by trauma from Helge's abuse. Helge admits to his misdeeds and leaves the dining room. Christian has a hallucination of Linda, causing him to faint. As he awakes, he learns from Helene that Michael is missing. Michael, also drunk, calls Helge outside and beats him severely. The following morning, while the family and guests eat breakfast, Helge comes in and speaks to the group. He admits to his wrongdoing and declares his love for his children. Michael tells his father to leave the table.",

    "Synopsis": "The film is about two working class women, Isa and Marie. Isa is a drifter and searching for a lover whom she had met during the summer. When she realizes that her search for him is futile and turns elsewhere, she meets Marie, who lives in a small French town near Lille. The two young women instantly find a connection as they both have been treated harshly by life and are living from day to day in short-time jobs, such as working in a textile factory or delivering leaflets in the streets. Marie lives in an apartment that she is looking after because the owners had a car accident in which everyone died, except for Sandrine, a teenager, who is in a coma. Marie invites Isa to live with her. Shortly thereafter Isa and Marie meet up with two bouncers, Fredo and Charly, whom they befriend. The men help them out and they have genuine fun together, although they are not much better off than the women. Isa is the kind of girl who always lands on her own two feet and has a casual c'est la vie attitude when it comes to life and generally doesn't let the hardships get to her, while Marie finds it hard to express herself emotionally, and gets angry when she feels vulnerable. Marie cannot put up with the way she is tossed around by the world, and so, despite being in a relationship with Charly, she tries to escape through a local playboy, Chriss, a rich nightclub owner, who regularly goes out with girls and views Marie as just another one of his random flings. Isa is tougher in that she can take the beating and stick with what is around her, and does not get carried away by the false possibility of a better life. Significantly, Isa refuses to sleep with her casual boyfriend Fredo, drawing her strength from within, while Marie is emotionally dependent on Chriss, who, it is clear, does not love her. Isa is well aware of Chriss's true intentions and tries to warn Marie, who refuses to listen. Isa finds Sandrine's diary and reads it to her during visits in the hospital. Meanwhile, Chriss decides to end his fling with Marie. Instead of breaking up with her in person, he asks Isa to tell her for him (she replies \"it's not for me to tell her\"), clearly afraid Marie would self-destruct in front of him, then leaving Marie's later calls unreturned. Meanwhile, Sandrine comes out of her coma, but Isa, who has visited her so faithfully while she was in a coma, decides not to see her while she is awake. After finally learning about Chriss' decision to end the relationship, Marie jumps out of a window. The film ends with Isa starting to work in a new factory.",

    "Synopsis": "On August 18, 1994, Martin Cahill leaves his home in Cowper Downs, Rathmines. He is ambushed by an assassin, who escapes on a motorcycle driven by an accomplice. As his family grieve, his Garda nemesis, Inspector Ned Kenny, arrives to see his corpse removed from the scene. In the 1950s, a young Cahill and his siblings engage in theft to supplement their family's meagre income. He is caught by a Garda as he attempts a theft from a butcher's shop, and is incarcerated in an industrial school. By the early 1980s, Cahill is released from prison and returns to his home at the run-down Hollyfield Buildings in Rathmines. Dublin Corporation is in the process of demolishing the buildings, something which Cahill opposes in the courts. Garda Sergeant Ned Kenny assists the Corporation in evicting current residents, and attempts to get Cahill to leave peacefully. After the demolition of the buildings, Cahill moves a caravan onto the site. The caravan is subsequently burned out. Cahill then erects a tent and continues to prevent construction of new houses. He backs down when Dublin Corporation provide him with a new home in Rathmines. Cahill purchases a new home in an upscale area for £80,000, turning his cash into a bank draft at a local bank. He then instructs his gang to rob the bank, humiliating the newly promoted Inspector Ned Kenny. Cahill and his associate Noel Curley commit an armed robbery of a video arcade. They are arrested and face trial. During the trial, Cahill attempts numerous tactics to get acquitted, including attempting to kill the State's chief forensic scientist with a car bomb. After the State fails to prove that Cahill and Curley put the victim of the armed robbery in fear of her life, they are acquitted. Cahill and his gang plan and commit a robbery of O'Connor's jewellery factory in Harold's Cross. It is the largest robbery in the history of the State, with the haul valued at over £2,000,000.

    "Synopsis": "Just before the turn of the new millennium, a strange disease hits Taiwan that causes people to crawl on the floor and search for dark places. It also rains constantly. Despite evacuation orders, tenants of a rundown apartment building stay put, including Hsiao Kang (Lee Kang-sheng). Hsiao Kang runs a food store with few customers. One day, a plumber arrives at Hsiao Kang's apartment to check the pipes. He drills a small hole into the floor which comes down through the ceiling of the woman downstairs (Yang Kuei-mei). The woman, who maintains her flooded apartment while stockpiling toilet paper, becomes annoyed by Hsiao Kang's antics on the other side of the hole. She confronts him at his store. However, the hole remains there, and the two continue to get on each other's nerves. The woman sprays her room, creating a smell that Hsiao Kang cannot stand; Hsiao Kang's alarm clock goes off, waking the woman. In spite of this, the two begin forming a connection. Someone rings Hsiao Kang's doorbell, but he does not answer. He lies down next to the hole and sticks his leg into it. The woman catches the disease and crawls into the toilet paper fort that she made. Hsiao Kang gets distraught. He bangs on the floor near the hole with a hammer. Eventually, the woman emerges from the fort. Hsiao Kang offers her a glass of water through the hole, and she drinks it. Hsiao Kang then pulls her up through the hole. In the final scene, the two slow dance with each other.",

    "film_title": "The Idiots (1998 film)",
    "Synopsis": "A seemingly anti-bourgeois group of adults spend their time seeking their \"inner idiot\" to release their inhibitions. They do so by behaving in public as if they were mentally disabled. At a restaurant, the patrons are disturbed by the group's antics, which are barely contained by their supposed \"handler\", Susanne. The group refers to this behavior as \"spassing\", a neologism derived from \"spasser\", the Danish equivalent of \"spaz\". Unaware that the group is pretending, Karen, a single diner, is initially sympathetic to what she believes are their genuine disabilities. One of the group members holds her hand, compelling her to go along with them in a taxi. During the ride, she discovers their act, leading to a mix of discomfort and curiosity. Upon arriving at a large house, she learns that Stoffer, the apparent leader of the group, is supposed to be selling the property (which belongs to his uncle), but instead, it becomes the focal point for the group's activities. The \"spassing\" is a self-defeating attempt by the group to challenge the establishment through provocation. The self-styled idiots feel that the society-at-large treats their intelligence uncreatively and unchallengingly; thus, they seek the uninhibited self-expression that they imagine a romantic ideal of disability will allow. Stoffer, at his birthday party, wishes for a \"gangbang\", so the group members have group sex (without participation of Karen). Josephine wanders off separately, and is followed by Jeppe. The two privately engage in intercourse, in an awkwardly deep connection. However, the next morning, Josephine's father arrives. After chastising the group, he reprimands Josephine for not taking her medication and orders her to return home. Several try to stop her, including Jeppe who lunges himself desperately onto the hood of the car, but is ultimately removed after a tearful exchange between him and Josephine. Then an agitated Stoffer calls for the group members to let idiocy invade their personal daily lives. Most of the members refuse to take up the challenge and decide to leave the group, leading the group to be dissolved. But Karen decides to take up the challenge. Karen takes Susanne back to her house, where they are greeted with surprise by Karen's mother. Karen has been missing for two weeks, following the death of her young baby; she offers no explanation of where she has been. Karen attempts to spaz in front of her family by dribbling her food, but this results in a violent slap from her husband, Anders. Karen and Susanne leave the house together.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1984, British journalist Arthur Stuart is writing an article about the withdrawal from public life of 1970s glam rock star Brian Slade following a death hoax ten years earlier, and is interviewing those who had a part in the entertainer's career. As each person recalls their thoughts, it becomes the introduction of the vignette for that particular segment in Slade's personal and professional life. Part of the story involves Stuart's family's reaction to his homosexuality, and how the gay and bisexual glam rock stars and music scene gave him the strength to come out. Rock shows, fashion, and rock journalism all play a role in showing the youth culture of 1970s Britain, as well as the gay culture of the time. At the beginning of his career, Slade is married to Mandy. When he comes to the United States, he seeks out American rock star Curt Wild and they become involved in each other's lives. The vignettes show Wild and Slade becoming increasingly difficult to work with as they become more famous. They suffer breakdowns in their personal and professional relationships. Eventually, Slade's career ends following the critical and fan backlash from his stage publicity stunt where he faked his own murder. As he gets closer to the truth of where Slade is now, Stuart is suddenly told by his editor that the story is no longer of public interest and Stuart has been assigned to the Tommy Stone tour. Coincidentally, Stuart has just discovered that, unknown to most, Tommy Stone is the new pseudonym and persona of Brian Slade. It is revealed that Stuart was also at the concert where Slade faked his death, and that after seeing Wild perform on another night, Wild and Stuart had a sexual encounter. Eventually, Stuart lightly confronts Tommy Stone and once again encounters Wild, who casually offers him a piece of jewellery once owned by Oscar Wilde.",

They get the idea while watching Federico Fellini's and after Storey is \"given\" a woman, Simato, to waive her pachinko debts. They sign one-year contracts with eight (and a half) women to this effect. The women each have a gimmick (one is a nun, another a kabuki performer, etc.).

    "Synopsis": "Manuela is an Argentine nurse who supervises donor organ transplants at Ramón y Cajal Hospital in Madrid. She is also a single mother to Esteban, a teenager who aspires to become a writer. On the night of Esteban's 17th birthday, he is hit and killed by a car while chasing after his favorite actress, Huma Rojo, for her autograph following a performance of A Streetcar Named Desire, where Huma portrays Blanche DuBois. Manuela allows her son's heart to be transplanted to a man in A Coruña. After tracking down the recipient, she resigns from her job and travels to Barcelona in search of Esteban's other mother, Lola, a transgender woman whom Manuela had kept secret from her son, just as she had never told Lola about the boy. In Barcelona, Manuela reunites with her old friend Agrado, a warm and witty transgender sex worker. She also befriends Huma as well as her co-star and lover Nina Cruz, who is a heroin addict, and young HIV-positive nun Rosa, who works in a shelter for battered sex workers and is pregnant with Lola's child. Manuela's life becomes entwined with theirs as she cares for Rosa during her pregnancy, works as Huma's personal assistant, or takes the stage as an understudy for Nina during one of her drug abuse crises. On her way to the hospital, Rosa asks the taxi to stop at a park where she spots her father's dog, Sapic, and then her own father, who suffers from Alzheimer's. He does not recognize Rosa and asks for her age and height, but Sapic recognizes her. Rosa dies giving birth to a healthy boy; at her funeral, Manuela finally reunites with Lola. Lola (formerly known as Esteban) is dying from AIDS and talks about how she always wanted a son. Manuela tells her about their own son Esteban and his fatal accident. Manuela adopts Rosa's son, Esteban, caring for him at Rosa's parents' house. The father does not understand who Manuela is, and Rosa's mother introduces her as the new cook who is living there with her son. Manuela introduces Esteban, Rosa's son, to Lola and gives her a picture of their own Esteban. Rosa's mother spots them from the street and confronts Manuela about letting strangers see the baby. Manuela tells her that Lola is Esteban's other parent, but Rosa's mother is appalled and blames Lola for causing Rosa's death, and fears that she will contract HIV from the baby. Deciding that she cannot live at Rosa's house any longer, Manuela flees back to Madrid with Esteban, and writes a letter to Huma and Agrado, apologizing once again for not saying goodbye like she did years before. Two years later, Manuela returns to Barcelona with Esteban, who has remained healthy and AIDS-free. At an AIDS convention, she meets up with Huma and Agrado, who now run a stage show together, and tells them that she is returning to stay with Esteban's grandparents. When Manuela asks about Nina, Agrado reveals that Nina broke up with Huma, returned to her town, got married, and now has a son of her own.",

    "film_title": "Cradle Will Rock",
    "Synopsis": "At the height of the Great Depression, the Federal Theatre Project, led by Hallie Flanagan, brings low-cost theater to millions across America. FTP and other projects of the Works Progress Administration face anti-communist criticism and increasing government pressure led by the new House Committee on Un-American Activities. In New York City, playwright Marc Blitzstein is working on his new musical, The Cradle Will Rock, but lacks the inspiration to finish it. While attending a public protest, he is visited by two imaginary figures representing his late wife and the famed German playwright Bertolt Brecht. They encourage him to make the play more relevant to the times rather than an abstract concept. He eventually finishes the play, and it is greenlit by Flanagan as an FTP production and attached to director Orson Welles and producer John Houseman. Anti-communist FTP clerk Hazel Huffman convenes a meeting of like-minded WPA employees. Tommy Crickshaw, a ventriloquist with FTP's vaudeville project who resents his assignment to train the untalented duo Sid and Larry, attends the meeting and finds himself attracted to Hazel. Although they grow closer while rehearsing the alarmist testimony Hazel hopes to give to HUAC, Hazel rejects Tommy's advances. Depressed, he oversleeps and wakes to find Sid and Larry performing his routine. Hazel is later called to testify before HUAC, prompting her coworkers to shun her. Margherita Sarfatti, an envoy of Benito Mussolini's government, visits New York to gain support from American industrialists for Mussolini's war effort. Among her connections are William Randolph Hearst, Nelson Rockefeller, and steel magnate Gray Mathers, whose pro-fascist dealings create tension with his wife, Constance, an enthusiastic patron of the arts and friend of Houseman. Sarfatti connects Rockefeller with Diego Rivera, who is commissioned to paint a mural in the lobby of Rockefeller Center. However, Rivera soon clashes with both Rockefeller and Sarfatti over the mural's communist themes, especially its depiction of Vladimir Lenin. Following Hazel's HUAC testimony, the WPA faces the threat of losing its budget. Although Flanagan appears before HUAC to give a passionate defense of FTP, the project is forced to cut funding for all FTP productions, lay off thousands of workers, and order all ongoing projects to cease their activities, including The Cradle Will Rock. A now-unemployed Tommy performs a set portraying his ventriloquist dummy as a Communist, before walking off the stage and leaving the dummy behind. The Cradle Will Rock s opening is cancelled in the wake of the FTP cutbacks, as the actors' union refuses to let them perform without federal approval. Rather than give in to defeat, Welles and Houseman (assisted by a gleeful Constance) set up an improvised performance in a shuttered theater, with Blitzstein as both cast and orchestra. Male lead Aldo Silvano, who struggles to support his family after breaking with his well-to-do parents over their fascist sympathies, reluctantly goes along with the union's decision to avoid losing his job; female lead Olive Stanton must choose between the show and her live-in relationship with successful costar John Adair. As Blitzstein begins the first song of the performance, the other actors, including Aldo and a now-homeless Olive, suddenly appear in the audience and perform the entire play without setting foot on the stage. As the show ends, the cast and audience break into celebration. Simultaneously, workers destroy Rivera's mural; Tommy shares a bittersweet embrace with a tearful Hazel in his dressing room; and a group of former FTP performers stage a mock funeral procession of Crickshaw's dummy (renamed \"Federal Theatre Project\"). The procession ends in present-day Times Square, which is lined with billboards advertising Broadway plays.",

    "Synopsis": "Felicia is an Irish teenager whose boyfriend, Johnny, has left to join the British Army after impregnating her. Taking a ferry to England, she begins a hopeless search for the lawnmower factory in Birmingham where she believes Johnny now works. Instead, she encounters Joseph Hilditch, a catering manager at a factory who is also the son of an eccentric TV chef of decades past. Hilditch regularly watches the old programmes of his presumably-deceased mother while he cooks her recipes and collects material about her. He offers to help Felicia find Johnny; however, his motives for doing so are initially unclear, and it is subsequently suggested through flashback sequences that he has befriended but then turned on vulnerable young women in the past. Hilditch offers to drive Felicia to what he suggests is the factory she is looking for, which is on the way to the hospital where the unmarried Hilditch claims he is going to visit his wife. Felicia fails to find Johnny at the factory; while she is out of the car, Hilditch goes through her bags and steals her money. Subsequently, Felicia comes across a Jamaican Christian pedlar who offers Felicia a free overnight stay at a church hostel. While staying at the hostel, Felicia discovers that her money has gone and, after appearing to accuse others at the home of stealing the money, goes to Hilditch's house. Meanwhile, Hilditch has traced Johnny to the barracks where he is serving, but does not disclose this to Felicia. He tells her that his wife has died and that she suggested that Felicia abort her unborn child. After the abortion, which Hilditch pays for, he takes her back to his house and gives her an overdose of sleeping pills. As she passes out, he explains that he has 'helped' many other vulnerable girls but 'lays them to rest' when they decide it is time to leave him. While Hilditch is digging out in his garden, the Jamaican witness and a new convert enter his yard and begin to preach. The Christian reveals that Felicia had told her about Hilditch, saying he was a kind but troubled man. Hilditch feels flashes of guilt and confesses that he did, in fact, steal from and cheat Felicia so that she would return to him. He explains that he feels lonely, and the horrified Christians leave. Upstairs in the house, Felicia awakens from her sleep and struggles down the stairs. Hilditch finds her trying to escape but allows her to leave. He later walks to his kitchen, where he hangs himself with a pair of tights.",

Called onto the case, Lieutenant Pharaon de Winter feels extreme revulsion. After having lost his partner and child in an accident, he now lives quietly with his widowed mother. At the weekend his neighbour Domino, who is sympathetic to his deeply affected state, asks him to join her and her lover Joseph, a bus driver. They go to the seaside and to a restaurant, but the reserved Pharaon finds Joseph ignorant and coarse. The police investigation moves slowly, with Pharaon looking into possibilities such as whether the murderer was a bus driver or a psychiatric patient. Noting that the murder site could be seen from Eurostar trains, he goes to London to interview passengers. But with no firm lead, the case is taken over by the Lille police. The factory where Domino works goes on strike and the police, led by Pharaon, have to quell a demonstration. Though outwardly angry, in fact Domino admires his quiet determination and offers herself to him. However, he rejects her explicit advances, saying “not like that”, and his mother warns her off. Then the Lille police arrest Joseph. When Pharaon gets to the police station, he finds him beaten up and weeping. At first baffled, Pharaon is soon surprised to find Joseph confessing in tears. Being a man of deep feeling, Pharaon comforts him, caressing him with his nose and kissing him on the mouth. When he goes home, his mother is out and Domino is at the kitchen table weeping. He comforts her. The final shot shows Pharaon sitting in a chair in his office at the police station, staring out the window, with handcuffs visibly shackling his wrists.",

    "Synopsis": "Kadosh is a drama about the Haredi society. In the opening scene, Meir (Yoram Hattab), a young Talmudic scholar, thanks God in his morning prayers for not being born a woman. At first, the marriage of Meir and his wife, Rivka (Yael Abecassis), appears tender and idyllic, but as the movie progresses, it becomes clear that Meir is concerned with the fact that he is childless after ten years of marriage. Meir's father, the Rabbi of their community in Jerusalem, tells Meir he is required to divorce Rivka because a woman's only function is to have children. Eventually, Meir complies, which destroys Rivka emotionally, and she moves away so that Meir can marry a cousin. Rivka's younger sister, Malka, marries Yosef in a match arranged by her parents, even though she loves Yaakov, a rock singer, who has abandoned the religious community. When Yosef is sexually cold to her, she leaves for a night with Yaakov; when she returns, Yosef calls her a \"slut\" and beats her with a belt. She runs out of their apartment. Meir, having divorced Rivka and re-married, shows up at Rivka's apartment on the Purim holiday (when men traditionally get drunk), and wants to be with her (a Haredi man would normally never be alone with a woman who is not his wife). She retreats initially. We do not see what happens, but when Malka runs to Rivka's apartment after Yosef beats her, Rivka babbles about being pregnant. In a scene which could be a dream or allegory, Rivka comes to Meir, who is sleeping, lies down with him, and drapes herself all over him, but he does not wake up (nor is his new wife present, suggesting this is not actually the storyline). Eventually, she falls asleep on top of him. He wakes up, and cannot rouse her. He shakes Rivka, and tries to wake her, as she has apparently died of a broken heart. The movie ends with Malka, alone after having left Yosef, looking over the city of Jerusalem.",

He finds her address in Toyohashi, several hundred miles to the west. Leaving home to see his mother, he meets his grandmother's neighbors, Kikujiro and his wife. Kikujiro's wife forces the sleazy, lazy and brash Kikujiro to accompany Masao on a journey to see his mother, telling Masao's grandmother that they are going to the beach. At the start of their journey, Kikujiro is not serious about reaching Toyohashi. Instead he gets absorbed in track cycling races and gambles away all their money. Later, left outside a yakitori restaurant, Masao encounters a child molester. After a narrow escape, Kikujiro promises to keep to the journey and take Masao to his mother. When the taxi Kikujiro steals breaks down, they are forced to hitchhike to Toyohashi, meeting various people along the way. They get lifts from a juggler and her boyfriend on a date, and a travelling poet who delivers them to Toyohashi. When they finally reach the address of Masao's mother, Kikujiro finds her living as a housewife with another man and their daughter, leaving Masao to tears. Kikujiro tries to console him by explaining that his mother had probably moved away. He tries to comfort Masao with a small blue bell shaped like an angel bullied from two bikers whom he happens to come across. Masao is so disappointed that Kikujiro cannot help but try to brighten up their return trip to Tokyo. He tells him an angel will come at the sound of the bell. They visit a summer matsuri held in a local Shinto shrine. While Kikujiro gets into trouble with some yakuza over a fixed shooting game, Masao dreams of dancing tengu. Back on the road, they meet the poet and the two bikers again. They decide to camp a few days together. Masao enjoys playing some traditional games with them. Kikujiro is reminded of his own mother (it is implied that she, like Masao's mother, also left him as a child). Kikujiro gets one of the bikers to take him from their camp to his mother's nursing home in Daito-cho, a small country town, but he eventually decides not to see her and returns to the camp. The men continue to do their best to entertain Masao by larking about for a few more days. Before they are to return to Tokyo, Masao dreams about them appearing over the Milky Way. In the morning, the bikers say goodbye to them and leave the camp. Masao and Kikujiro get a lift in the poet's van to Tokyo. After dropping them off at a bridge, the poet continues on his way to Osaka and Kyūshū. Before Masao and Kikujiro part, Kikujiro says, \"Let's do it again sometime,\" and Masao thanks him. Kikujiro tells Masao to take care of his grandmother. As Kikujiro turns to leave, Masao realizes that he doesn't know Kikujiro's name (he has been referring to him as \"uncle\" throughout the film) and asks him. Kikujiro answers, \"Kikujiro! Now scram!\", before the two part ways. Masao passes a small bridge with the angel bell ringing, mirroring the first shot of Masao at the start of the film.",

    "Synopsis": "Port Henry, Alaska, is a town undergoing stress as the local economy switches from an industrial one based on the canning and paper industries towards a tourism-based model. Joe Gastineau (David Strathairn) is a former high school basketball star and fisherman who now works as a handyman, particularly for Frankie (Kathryn Grody) and Lou (Rita Taggart), a lesbian couple who own the local resort hotel. Joe is friends with teenager Noelle De Angelo (Vanessa Martinez), who also works for Frankie and Lou. At an event at the hotel, Noelle's mother, lounge singer Donna (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), breaks up with her live-in boyfriend and asks Joe to help her move. The two become close and eventually begin a romantic relationship. Meanwhile, Joe gets the chance to return to fishing when Frankie and Lou ask him to work a fishing boat that they have acquired as collateral from local fisherman Harmon King (Leo Burmester). Donna' relationship with Noelle is strained, mainly because of Noelle's disapproval of her mother's lifestyle. This is exacerbated when Donna begins dating Joe, whom Noelle had a crush on. Donna also overhears the story of why Joe quit fishing: he had been involved in a deadly sinking that claimed the lives of his boatmates, including the brother of local bush pilot and small-time criminal \"Smilin' Jack\" Johannson (Kris Kristofferson). When Joe's dissolute half-brother Bobby (Casey Siemaszko) shows up, he asks Joe to help crew his boat to pick up a client. Joe brings along Donna and Noelle. They dock for the night in an isolated bay, and Bobby reveals the truth: he is involved in marijuana smuggling and had dumped a load overboard when he was spooked by the police. Now they are going to meet Bobby's partners to settle his debt. That night, men sneak onto the boat and kill Bobby. Joe, Donna, and Noelle flee to a nearby island where the men begin to hunt them. They take shelter in an abandoned cabin and try to survive. As they do, they grow closer. Noelle finds a diary written by a teenage girl who had lived in the cabin with her family. She spends the nights reading segments of the diary to Joe and Donna. Eventually, Donna looks at the diary and discovers that it is blank after the portion her daughter Noelle had read during the first two evenings: Noelle had made up most of its contents, expressing her own feelings. They maintain a signal fire and scrape some food from the seashore. After a week and a half, a seaplane piloted by Smilin' Jack Johannson lands. He says that he is looking for supplies, his radio is busted, and that he doesn't have enough fuel to fly them out. He tells Joe that he was hired by a couple of men to look for three people roughing it. When told of Bobby's murder, Jack expresses sympathy and promises to return the next day and rescue them. Joe, who does not trust Jack, sees that the radio was removed, and remains unsure of whether the seaplane return will bring rescue or the men who killed his brother. A stressful few days of rain prevent any flights' return. One morning, Joe, Donna, and Noelle gather on the beach as a seaplane flies towards them, larger than the one belonging to Jack.",

    "Synopsis": "In the spring of 1942, a few months before the notorious Battle of Stalingrad, Adolf Hitler (Leonid Mozgovoy) retires to his secluded Berghof Retreat, on a remote hilltop of the Bavarian Alps, near Berchtesgaden in Bavaria, to unite with his long-time female companion Eva Braun (Yelena Rufanova). At the residence, Braun spends her spare time with trivial pursuits such as whimsically dancing in the nude, humming to military-style marching band music, and rummaging through Hitler's personal belongings. Later, Braun is thrilled to learn that her beloved \"Adi\", as she affectionately calls him, will be joining her for a visit. Hitler is accompanied by guests Joseph Goebbels (Leonid Sokol), Magda Goebbels (Yelena Spiridonova), Martin Bormann (Vladimir Bogdanov), and a priest (Anatoli Shvedersky) for conversation and playful banter. During his stop-over, Hitler raves and rants on topics ranging from food, health, and climate change to wartime politics. After roaming through the mountainous landscape, Hitler is triumphant upon hearing of Germany's military victories. In a scene of political satire, he claims to have never heard of the Auschwitz concentration camp. Towards the end of Hitler's visit, Braun reminds him that no one can escape death or is infallible in an attempt to expose a hidden weakness within him as he embarks with his motorcade to continue Nazi Germany's military campaign.",

    "Synopsis": "Pierre lives a carefree life with his widowed mother in a Normandy chateau, enjoying rising fame as a pseudonymous author. He also visits Lucie, his fiancée and childhood friend, at her parents' chateau. In a bar he sees his cousin Thibault, a stockbroker, who says he is welcome to stay at Thibault's apartment in Paris but wonders why Pierre is being followed by a young vagrant woman. When Pierre turns to look, the woman runs away. Driving through the forest, Pierre is disturbed to see the vagrant woman, who resembles a ghostly figure from his dreams. She tells him in a strong foreign accent that she is his half-sister Isabelle and recounts her unhappy life. She and her two companions (a Romanian woman, Razerka, and a small girl) are apparently refugees from conflict in Eastern Europe. Abandoning his home, mother and fiancée, Pierre takes Isabelle to Paris and goes to see Thibault, who bitterly insists he doesn't recognise the man and throws them out. Wandering the streets of Paris, fearful of deportation, the group find a cheap hotel. Pierre rejects his previous ideas for a second novel in favour of a grittier, more mature work that reflects the hidden truths of life. His publisher warns that his sophomoric pursuit of harsh truths will result in affected and inferior work compared to the youthful innocence that comes naturally to him, and refuses his request for an advance. At the zoo, Pierre misanthropically tells the small girl that the animals act unhappy because to them, all humans stink. She is slapped by an adult stranger after telling random people in the street that they stink, falls, and incurs a head wound she dies from. Again fearful of deportation, Pierre, Isabelle, and Razerka leave her body and proceed to a run-down warehouse commandeered by a terroristic cult; apparently in exchange for chaperoning Razerka safely to a man she knows there, Pierre and Isabelle are given lodging with the group, who train for guerrilla warfare and practise industrial music. Pierre and Isabelle succumb to the incestuous passion that had been coalescing till that point. Pierre scribbles away in a daze punctuated by learning of his mother's death (apparently a suicide) while trying to find his whereabouts. In the winter Lucie, suffering from a recurring fever, finds Pierre at the warehouse and demands to stay there under a false identity to 'protect' Isabelle from the truth of his abandonment of her, accepting Pierre's disappearance and relationship with Isabelle out of love for him. Pierre similarly keeps the nature of his ties to Isabelle from Lucie. Isabelle feels inadequate and desperately tries to ingratiate herself with the two, offering to take care of Lucie during her periods of sickness. Desperate to raise funds, Pierre makes an appearance on television to reveal his true identity but finds some in the television audience disbelieving him and others hostile because of his disconnection to his debut novel. Pierre's long days of writing continue through the winter; at one point he dreams of him and Isabelle copulating and then drowning in a river of blood. During a walk by the Seine, the trio happen upon an autobiography of Pierre's father: he is alarmed when Isabelle seems not to recognise the man on the cover, supposedly their father whom Isabelle said she had met once. Despairing over the doubt in her she fears she has instilled in Pierre, Isabelle attempts suicide and goes to hospital where a vengeful Thibault reveals Lucie's true identity to her. Pierre is brutally rejected by his publisher after submitting his manuscript anonymously, and Isabelle confronts him over his deception of her. Pierre despairs on seeing Lucie debasing herself by living in the squat and at the ruination of his plans; he accepts an invitation from Thibault to fight and steals two handguns from the cult to confront his cousin in central Paris, where Pierre immediately shoots Thibault in the head and is arrested. In despair at losing Pierre, Isabelle insists to him that she was always telling the truth and throws herself in front of a vehicle as he is driven to jail.",

    "Synopsis": "When her probationary employment ends without her being hired, Rosetta (Émilie Dequenne) engages in a violent struggle against her manager and the policemen when she refuses to leave the premises. She returns home to \"The Grand Canyon\", the caravan park where she lives with her alcoholic mother, who mends worn clothes for Rosetta to sell to charity shops. They get into a physical struggle over her mother accepting gifts from men for sexual favours. Rosetta goes to a nearby river and lays out fish traps to poach trout for food. Unable to receive unemployment pay, refusing to take welfare, and desperate for work, Rosetta asks around for vacancies until she comes upon a waffle stand. She befriends the worker, Riquet (Fabrizio Rongione), and asks the owner (Olivier Gourmet) for a job, without success. Later, Rosetta treats her period cramps with pain relievers and a hairdryer, warming her abdomen. Riquet makes an unexpected visit to the caravan park, startling Rosetta. He informs her that a colleague was fired and that she can have the job. Her mother's promiscuity resulting from alcoholism prompts Rosetta to encourage her to visit a rehabilitation clinic. However, her mother's denial of her addiction causes a physical fight between them. Her mother runs away and leaves Rosetta to nearly drown in the river by the park. She decides to stay with Riquet for the night and inquires about renting a bed in the building. During the awkward evening, Rosetta discovers a waffle iron in his possession. He tries to get Rosetta to dance, but her period cramps put an end to it. As she lies in bed, she tries to convince herself that her life has started to function normally. At work, she is replaced after three days by the owner's son, who failed school, leading to another emotional meltdown. Rosetta is moderately pacified when the owner tells her she will be contacted if an opportunity arises. She begins a new but fruitless search for employment and keeps Riquet company during work. He offers to pay for a waffle, but she refuses his charity. While fishing Rosetta hears a motorbike engine, thinking it is the janitor, she throws her fish traps into the pond, though it turns out to be only Riquet. He then falls into the pond while helping her find the traps. She watches him thrashing in the muddy water and hesitates before helping him out. Later, she discovers that Riquet has been selling his own waffles during business hours, due to him offering her an under-the-table job helping him mix the batter. After some contemplation, she tells the owner. Rosetta looks on as Riquet is thrown out of the stand, and she is handed his apron. Betrayed and hurt, Riquet chases her on his moped until he catches up to her and demands to know her motive. Rosetta states she wanted a job and wishes she hadn't saved him from the water. He counters that she still helped him and lets her leave. The next day, Riquet buys a waffle from Rosetta while she is working, and she can barely look him in the eye. Returning home, she finds her mother unconscious and inebriated in front of the caravan. She drags her mother inside and puts her to bed. Rosetta calls her boss on a payphone and quits her job. Returning to the trailer, she turns on the gas and leaves it running in an attempt to asphyxiate herself and her mother. The gas runs out though, and she goes to the landlord to buy another canister. As she hauls the heavy canister of gas with great difficulty, Riquet arrives on his moped and circles around her. She eventually collapses to the ground and bursts into tears. Riquet helps her up, and she turns to gaze at him as she slowly regains her composure.",

    "film_title": "The Emperor and the Assassin",
    "Synopsis": "The film covers much of Ying Zheng's career, recalling his early experiences as a hostage and foreshadowing his dominance over China. He is essentially depicted as an idealist seeking to impose a peace or unity on the world. However, his experiencing of various betrayals and losses slowly turn him into a mad tyrant. The story consists of three main incidents: the attempt by Jing Ke to assassinate Ying Zheng in 227 BCE; the (fictitious) rumour of Chief Minister Lü Buwei's having sired Ying Zheng on his concubine before transferring her to become the Queen Dowager; and the story of an official having sired children by the Queen Dowager herself. The first incident is the climax of the film, with earlier scenes foreshadowing it; the other two incidents occur between the fictional genesis and historical manifestation of the first. In the film, Ying Zheng sends his concubine Lady Zhao to the Yan state as a spy to enlist a Yan assassin to attempt to assassinate him, intending to use that as a casus belli to start a war against Yan. Lady Zhao persuades Jing Ke to perform the assassination. After learning of Ying Zheng's massacre of the children in her home state of Zhao, Lady Zhao desires the assassination in earnest. The attempt fails, but Ying Zheng expresses his fury when his associates make no attempt to stop the assassin and he is forced to kill Jing Ke himself. He is further saddened when Lady Zhao returns to Qin only to retrieve Jing Ke for burial.",

By accident, an aristocrat, Jacques de Clèves, a famous and wealthy doctor, is also there, although no words are exchanged. Later all of them meet again at a Franz Schubert piano recital (D. 946) by Maria João Pires. While Dr. de Clèves falls immediately in love with Catherine, she doesn't feel a strong passion for him. Nevertheless, she eventually accepts the marriage proposal from him. After a brief honeymoon, the couple settle in Paris. One night the couple attend a gala concert where Pedro Abrunhosa, the well-known Portuguese singer, performs. Catherine feels an instant strong attraction towards Pedro. However, this passion leaves her divided and embittered by a strong sense of guilt, especially because she does not have the same feeling towards her husband. Meanwhile, Catherine<nowiki></nowiki>s mother falls very ill, and, before she dies, tells Catherine that she is aware of her attraction to Pedro but advises her not to yield to the passion but to maintain her reputation. A nun (Leonor Silveira) who was a childhood friend of Catherine listens to her sorrows and doubts, and gives her advice and comfort. Nevertheless, her husband learns about it. Despite the fact that Catherine has done no wrong, he suffers and falls seriously ill, and dies. Catherine feels a strong sense of guilt for her husband's death. She goes to her friend in the convent for advice and comfort. Her friend advises her to pursue her heart's love, but Catherine fears an uncertain future of passion and decides to avoid Pedro, who has now moved to an apartment across the street in the hope of meeting her.

    "film_title": "The Straight Story",
    "Synopsis": "In Laurens, Iowa, elderly Alvin Straight is found lying on his kitchen floor after a fall. His daughter, Rose, takes him to see a doctor, who admonishes him to give up tobacco, improve his diet, and use a walker, all of which he rejects. When Alvin's brother, Lyle, suffers a stroke, Alvin decides to visit Lyle, even though they have not spoken in ten years. Lyle lives in Mount Zion, Wisconsin, 240 miles away. As neither Alvin (due to his age) nor Rose (due to an unspecified disability) has a driver's license, Alvin decides to make the trip on his riding mower. His plan surprises his family, friends, and neighbors. The mower soon breaks down, forcing Alvin to accept a ride from a passing tour bus and call for help. However, he is determined to continue the trip, and buys a used 1966 John Deere 110 lawn tractor to continue his journey. Alvin meets a variety of people on the road. He shares his dinner with a young girl hitchhiker, who ran away from home out of fear that her family would be upset with her pregnancy. Alvin reflects about the importance of family, comparing it to a bundle of sticks that is hard to break compared to a single stick. The next day, she leaves him a bundle of sticks tied together as a thank-you. Several passing RAGBRAI cyclists are amused to see him on the highway and welcome him to their campsite. He speaks with some of the cyclists about growing old. He also meets a distraught woman who hit a deer during her commute and tearfully rants about how she keeps on hitting deer despite her prayers. Alvin respectfully cooks and eats the deer. Alvin's tractor begins to fail, throwing his journey into jeopardy. His transmission fails as he travels down a steep hill, but he manages to stop. Danny, a local, invites Alvin to camp in his backyard until the tractor is repaired. He offers to drive Alvin to Mount Zion, but Alvin declines, preferring to travel his own way. Running low on cash, Alvin calls Rose to send him his Social Security check. Two bickering mechanics overcharge him for fixing his tractor, but he cannily bargains the price down. A fellow veteran invites Alvin for a drink, and they exchange traumatic stories about their experiences in World War II. Alvin, a sniper during the war, declines a beer but confesses that he is still haunted by killing an American in a friendly fire incident and says that he became an alcoholic when he got back home, but he is now sober. After crossing into Wisconsin, Alvin chats with a Catholic priest who knows of Lyle and his stroke. The priest says that Lyle never mentioned a brother. Alvin admits that he wants to make amends. Although the exact cause of the estrangement is never stated, only that being the one to make the effort is hard on him, Alvin says alcohol was involved. Alvin finally arrives in Mount Zion. To steel himself, he drinks his first beer in years. Tractor trouble stops him just short of Lyle's dilapidated cabin, but he persists. Lyle invites Alvin to sit together on the porch, without recrimination or bitterness. He asks if Alvin rode the tractor all the way just to see him. Alvin quietly confirms this, and Lyle's eyes well up with tears. The two men sit together silently and gaze up at the stars.",

    "Synopsis": "The film intricately weaves together the fragmented memories of Marcel Proust as he reflects on his past, often through involuntary memory triggered by sights, sounds, and smells. The narrative begins with Marcel on his deathbed, dictating his thoughts to his caretaker, Céleste. As he reminisces, the story delves into various flashbacks, each one unraveling a piece of Marcel’s life and the relationships that shaped him. One of the earliest memories is from Marcel’s childhood, where he is seen at a party with his family. His interactions with Gilberte, the daughter of Odette de Crécy, are highlighted as they pose for a photograph together. This moment triggers a cascade of memories, including a lunch with Gilberte where they discuss literature, and Marcel's heartbreak over his ex-fiancée, Albertine, who had been unfaithful to him with both men and women. As the memories continue, Marcel experiences a haunting dream where a ghostly Albertine visits him, followed by a stormy walk with Gilberte where they discuss her husband, Robert de Saint-Loup. The narrative shifts back and forth in time, depicting Marcel’s youth and his complex feelings toward Gilberte, Albertine, and Robert. The film also explores the tumultuous relationships between other characters, such as Robert’s affair with Charlie Morel, a musician, and the resulting tensions. Marcel's observations of these relationships are often tinged with a sense of melancholy and longing, as he recalls the various ways love, jealousy, and betrayal have influenced his life. One poignant memory involves Marcel discovering a broken tea cup that had been saved by Gilberte, symbolizing the fragmented nature of his past relationships. Another significant scene occurs during a dinner party where the guests gossip about art and society, further emphasizing the superficiality and pretensions of the social circles Marcel once moved in. As the war rages on, Marcel finds himself in various settings, from opulent parties to male brothels, where he witnesses the darker sides of human nature. In one disturbing scene, he spies on Charlus, an older man who engages in brutal erotic role-playing at the brothel. This encounter highlights the undercurrents of power, control, and secrecy that run through Marcel’s recollections. The narrative also touches on the impact of war, with characters like Robert discussing the bravery of common soldiers and the toll the conflict has taken on their lives. Marcel's interactions with figures like Le Prince de Foix and Madame Verdurin reveal the shifting dynamics of society in the aftermath of the war, as well as the personal losses and disillusionments that have marked Marcel’s journey. In the final act, the film returns to Marcel’s present, where he visits places from his past, including a park and a library at the Princess de Guermantes’ home. These visits are interspersed with flashbacks that blend seamlessly into the present, creating a dreamlike quality that underscores the fluidity of time and memory in Marcel’s world. The film concludes with a reflection on Marcel’s life, drawing a parallel between his experiences and a quote from the sculptor Salvini about the paradox of time and the nature of existence. As the elderly Marcel walks towards his younger self on a beach, the film encapsulates the essence of Proust’s work: a meditation on memory, time, and the enduring impact of the past on the present.",

Waitress Nadia, \"shy, with a backpack and her hair in girlish twists\", spends all her time going on blind dates with unsatisfactory men from personal ads, while her hairdresser sister Debbie struggles to raise her 11-year-old son without much help from his irresponsible father. Meanwhile, Molly is pregnant but her husband Eddie has left his job without telling her. Eileen and Bill, their parents, are virtually estranged since the departure of their eldest son Darren, who they have not heard from since he left home; having left, he is the only happy one in the family. Eileen takes her unsaid frustrations out on the neighbour's barking dog, poisoning it when it prevents her from sleeping. Franklin is an over-sensitive man who frequents the coffee house where Nadia works. He is unable to summon the courage to talk to her, instead listening to music he thinks she would like alone in his bedroom. Nadia sleeps with one of her dates, the handsome Tim, but he is not really interested in her. Molly and Eddie have a fight when she discovers he has left his job and he leaves. She goes into labour believing he has permanently left her, but he has really had an accident on his motorbike. Debbie's son, Jack, is mugged when his father Dan leaves him alone and Jack goes off on his own to watch fireworks.

    "Synopsis": "The film is composed of individual stories where the lives of the characters intersect in misunderstandings and difficulties. A group of deaf children are playing a game of charades in French sign language. A young girl begins to act out gestures of fear as she slowly walks backwards with hunched shoulders and a side stance until she reaches a wall where she cannot escape and attempts to protect herself in a hunched position. The other children are not able to guess what is taking place. Anne (Juliette Binoche) is walking down a Parisian street and runs into Jean who is looking for his brother Georges (Thierry Neuvic), Anne’s boyfriend. Anne tells Jean that Georges is in Kosovo. Jean tells Anne that he’s left his father’s farm and asks to stay at Anne’s apartment. Jean leaves with the keys but throws the remnants of his pastry at Maria, a Romanian homeless woman sitting on the ground. Amadou observes this and confronts Jean, telling Jean that he must apologize to the homeless woman. An altercation ensues, police arrive, and the police arrest Amadou, release Jean, and escort Maria to the airport for deportation. At home, Amadou’s mother (Hélène Diarra) discusses her distress with the police ransacking their home and unjustly arresting her son. After Amadou’s release, he goes on a date, but at the same restaurant Anne enters and tells her friends that Amadou is the man who attacked Jean without cause. Amadou is later seen participating in a group drumming performance as an instructor. Anne rehearses for different films. She effectively acts out scenes of terror and humor that blur the space between reality and fiction. At home, while ironing her clothes, she hears her neighbors and a young girl crying loudly in what sounds like physical beatings. When her boyfriend Georges arrives back from Kosovo, he is distraught by civilian life. In the grocery store, Anne shares the story of the screaming child in the apartment but Georges appears apathetic. He spends his days photographing people on the train and thinking about his imprisonment in the war. Anne is later seen attending the funeral of “petite Françoise,” the girl who she heard screaming in the apartment. Anne does not confront the parents. There is ambiguity as to whether this girl was the deaf girl who acted out the gestures of fear in the game of charades. Anne and Georges visit his father (Josef Bierbichler) in the farm town. His father who lives in poverty says that his younger son Jean has disappeared, but he does not intend to search for him. In Romania, Maria has reconnected with family who are living in a run-down apartment. She shares a story of how she gave a gypsy woman some money but was worried that she may have caught a disease from her so she immediately washed her hands; but in Paris when Maria was homeless, a well-dressed man was about to hand her some money, but threw it at her after seeing how dirty her hands were. Maria eventually returns to Paris and continues to seek places to beg for money. The film ends with an untranslated sign language gesture from a different child.",

    "film_title": "Dancer in the Dark",
    "Synopsis": "In Washington State in 1964, Selma Ježková, a Czech immigrant, has moved to the United States with her 12-year-old son Gene Ježek. They live a life of poverty as Selma works at a factory with her good friend Kathy, whom she nicknames Cvalda. She rents a trailer home on the property of local police officer Bill Houston and his wife, Linda. She is romantically pursued by the shy but persistent Jeff. Selma is gradually losing her vision due to a degenerative eye condition, but still is saving money to pay for an operation that will prevent Gene from sharing her fate. She also takes part in rehearsals for a production of The Sound of Music and accompanies Kathy to the local cinema, where together they watch Hollywood musicals, as Kathy describes them to her. In her day-to-day life, Selma slips into daydreams, imagining herself in a musical (\"Cvalda\"). Jeff and Kathy begin to realize that Selma's vision is worse than they thought, and that she has been memorizing eye charts in order to pass vision tests and keep her job. Bill reveals to Selma that Linda's excessive spending has put the couple's house in danger of foreclosure by their bank. He has contemplated suicide but cannot bring himself to carry out the act. Selma promises to keep his secret and confides in him about her advancing vision loss. Bill pretends to leave, but watches Selma hide her money in a tin. The next day, Selma's boss Norman believes that her eye condition has deteriorated; he accepts her resignation and pays her final wages, but promises to re-hire her once her sight has improved. However, Kathy accuses him of firing her. Not willing to get her job back, Jeff tries to escort her home by car, but she walks home along a railroad bridge instead (\"I've Seen It All\"). Opening the tin to add her money to it, Selma finds it empty. Realizing that Bill has robbed her, she goes to his house to confront him. Linda accuses Selma of trying to seduce her husband, explaining that Bill told her Selma wanted him for his money. Not wanting to reveal her knowledge of the impending foreclosure, Selma ignores Linda and confronts Bill about the theft. They fight over the money, with Bill drawing a gun only to be accidentally shot by Selma. Bill yells for Linda to call the police, saying that Selma has tried to rob him, then begs Selma to kill him, telling her it is the only way she will ever reclaim her stolen money. Selma shoots Bill several times, but only wounds him further due to her poor vision, and finally beats him to death with her safe deposit box once the gun runs out of ammunition. She imagines that Bill's corpse stands up and slow dances with her, and he and Linda absolve her of blame and tell her she just did what she had to do (\"Smith & Wesson\"). Taking her money back, she flees the house and pays for Gene's operation in advance. Not knowing about the murder, Jeff takes Selma to rehearsal, where her director calls the police to have her arrested (\"In the Musicals, Part 1\"). In court, she is accused of being a Communist sympathizer and of pretending to be blind to exploit the American healthcare system. Although she tells as much truth about the situation as she can, she refuses to reveal Bill's secret, saying that she had promised not to, even though revealing the secret could help to clear her name. When her claim of sending all her money to her father, Oldřich Nový, is proven false, she is convicted of murder and sentenced to death (\"In the Musicals, Part 2\"). Kathy and Jeff eventually figure out what happened and recover Selma's money, using it instead to pay for a trial lawyer who can free her. Selma refuses the lawyer, opting to face execution by hanging rather than let her son go blind, but she is deeply distraught as she awaits her death (\"107 Steps\"). As Selma reaches the gallows, she begins to panic and the guards strap her to a board. Kathy runs in with news that the operation has saved Gene's vision and gives his glasses to Selma. Relieved, Selma sings one final song on the gallows with no musical accompaniment, but is hanged before she can finish the last verse; the final lines are displayed as the proceedings conclude (\"Next to Last Song\").",

    "film_title": "Devils on the Doorstep",
    "Synopsis": "In a small village named Rack-Armor Terrace in Hebei, at the foot of the Great Wall of China, a local peasant called Ma Dasan is caught by surprise when a man bursts into his home one night and deposits two men in gunnysacks, instructing him at gunpoint to keep them captive but alive for the next few days and interrogate them. The man, identified only as \"Me\", leaves before Ma can catch a glimpse of him. One of the gunnysacks contains Kosaburo Hanaya, a belligerent Japanese sergeant; the other Dong Hanchen, an obsequious Chinese interpreter working for the Japanese Army. Ma hurriedly enlists the help of his fellow villagers. Fearing both the mysterious \"Me\" and the Japanese, the village decides to follow the instructions from \"Me\" and detains the prisoners in Ma's cellar. Hanaya repeatedly attempts to provoke the peasants into killing him, but Dong, fearing for his own life, alters Hanaya's words in translation to make him appear conciliatory. The mystery man fails to return by the eve of Chinese New Year as promised. Six months later, the villagers finally run out of patience and resolve to kill the prisoners. The task falls on Ma after a drawing of lots. Not daring to commit murder, Ma instead hides the prisoners in a watchtower along the Great Wall, where he visits them regularly to bring them food and water. However, an unsuccessful escape attempt by the prisoners reveals Ma's secret to the rest of the village. A bitter argument ensues and the village decides to hire an assassin from town to carry out the deed. Ma enlists the help of an old man known as One Stroke Liu, a former Imperial executioner. He is told that being beheaded by Liu feels like a passing breeze, and that the severed head will roll nine times on the ground, blink three times, and smile in a gesture of gratitude for such a painless death. However, Liu fails to harm either prisoner with one stroke. Claiming that it is the will of Heaven, Liu leaves with the prisoners uninjured. By this time, however, Hanaya has lost all his defiance and is filled only with gratitude towards the villagers. He promises to reward the village with two wagons of grain should he be released. The villagers agree and return the prisoners to the Japanese Army encampment in the nearby town. However, the Japanese Army has already made Hanaya a war hero, believing that he was killed in battle. Returning alive after being a prisoner shames the Army. The commander of the encampment, Captain Inokichi Sakatsuka, gives Hanaya a merciless beating but feels honor-bound to fulfill the agreement between the latter and the village. Captain Sakatsuka and his men bring a great bounty of food and wine to the village and hold a feast there that evening, as Ma goes off to fetch his lover Yu'er from a neighboring village. During the feast, Captain Sakatsuka demands to have the man who captured Hanaya. He also accuses Ma of sneaking off to fetch resistance fighters. Not given a satisfactory answer, he orders all villagers to be killed and the village to be burned. Ma and Yu'er return on a raft only to find the entire village in flames. Meanwhile, Hanaya is about to commit harakiri before being stopped by Captain Sakatsuka and informed that Japan has recently surrendered, and the war is over. After the Chinese National Revolutionary Army takes back the area, Dong is publicly executed for collaborating with the enemy. Ma, bent on revenge, disguises himself as a cigarette vendor and loiters outside the Japanese encampment, now converted into a POW camp. When two Japanese soldiers come out to buy cigarettes, Ma hacks them with an axe and breaks into the camp, killing more POWs. He finds and pursues Hanaya, but is brought down by guards before he can kill the latter. Major Gao, commander of the Chinese Army contingent administering the town, condemns Ma's act as too despicable to deserve death by the hands of a Chinese soldier, and instead orders a Japanese POW to carry out the execution before a massive crowd. Captain Sakatsuka hands a katana to Hanaya, who takes careful aim before delivering the fatal strike. As Ma's head falls to the ground, it rolls nine times, blinks three times, and smiles, just as 'One Strike' Liu's victims were supposed to have done.",

    "Synopsis": "Eureka is a drama set mainly in rural Kyushu, Japan, and is almost entirely shot in sepia tone. It tells the story of the lasting effects of a violent experience on three people, a teenage brother and sister, Naoki and Kozue Tamura and a bus driver, Makoto Sawai. These three are the sole survivors after the bus is hijacked by a gunman. The actual violent events which traumatise them are not shown in detail. The extent to which the three have been affected slowly becomes apparent. Naoki and Kozue do not return to school, do not speak and become dissociated from their parents. Some time after the hijack, their mother abandons the family. Later their father is killed in a car crash. It is not clear whether his death is suicide. The two children continue to live alone in the family home. Meanwhile, Makoto is finding it impossible to carry on normal life and takes to the road, leaving his estranged wife living in the family home with his elderly father, elder brother, his wife and their daughter. After some time, Makoto returns home to find that his wife has left him. He cannot return to driving a bus and takes a job as a day-labourer with an old school-friend. Relationships between Makoto and his brother begin to deteriorate and Makoto moves in with Naoki and Kozue. He takes over the housekeeping and makes sure they eat properly. Kozue now begins to communicate a little but Naoki remains mute. The detective who dealt with the hijacking begins to harass Makoto about the murder of a woman in the neighbourhood, apparently without any evidence. While Makoto is out at work one day, the children's older student cousin Akihiko arrives and states he intends to stay to look after the children. He and Makoto are uneasy with each other but the four people settle down into a kind of family arrangement. A further murder takes place and this time the victim is a friend of Makoto's. He is arrested and questioned by the detective but is finally released. He talks to his friend and co-worker about his wish to return to driving and forms a plan to get all of them, Naoki, Kozue, Akihiko and himself away from their troubles. He buys an old bus which they convert for living accommodation and they all set off on an extended tour of the island. Kozue becomes more relaxed as they travel around but Naoki appears more disturbed. It eventually becomes clear that it is Naoki who is the murderer. Makoto confronts him and persuades him to give himself up. The remaining three carry on with the journey until Makoto finally loses his temper with Akihiko's cynical and shallow outlook and throws him off the bus. Makoto and Kozue continue on their journey until, finally, when they reach the peak of the highest mountain in Kyushu, both realise they are able to face ordinary life again. As they reach this understanding the film turns to colour.",

Marianne had been happily married to Markus, an orchestra conductor, with a young daughter Isabelle. Her best friend is David, who is seeking funding for a film project.

In Paris, Marianne and David begin their affair. David also asks Marianne about her sexual history, and Marianne shares her list of experiences; but this mostly consists of her relations with Markus, who she said had satisfied her in ways no one else had.

Markus realises they are having an affair and eventually discovers the two together. Markus begins to seek a divorce, and seeks full custody of Isabelle. Marianne gets a lawyer, who tells her Markus has the upper hand, given her desertion of the home.

    "Synopsis": "Middle-class couple Michel (Laurent Lucas) and Claire (Mathilde Seigner) are taking their three daughters, Jeanne, Sarah, and Iris, on a trip to see Michel's parents. The car has no air conditioning and the children are feeling sick, so the family decides to make a rest stop and turn back. At the rest stop, Michel runs into Harry (Sergi López), a high school acquaintance of Michel's who he hasn't seen for years. Harry is doing very well for himself, and is traveling with his girlfriend Plum (Sophie Guillemin) to show her Switzerland. Harry asks if he and Plum can come back to Michel's house for a drink, and Michel accepts. Michel's summer home is a run-down house that the family plans to fix up. Michel finds that his father has renovated the bathroom without his consent. At dinner, Harry reminds Michel of a poem he had published in a school newspaper, as well as a science fiction story, The Flying Monkeys; he then offers to help the family out however he can, claiming money is no object. The next day, after Michel tries to fill in a deep well in the front yard, the family car dies in the middle of the road, but Harry purchases a new one for them, despite Michel and Claire's protests. Amidst all this, Michel hears from his parents, who insist on coming to his house instead; Michel's father is not supposed to drive, so Michel insists on picking them up. When he brings them to the house, Harry and Plum are there, and Harry sees the pressure they put on Michel. Harry and Plum leave to stay in a hotel for the night. But Harry sneaks out, steals a van, and goes to Michel's parents' house, claiming Michel is in trouble and they should follow him. They get in the car and follow him, but Harry tricks them into driving off the road and over a cliff, killing them both. Michel is distraught to learn his parents are dead, and the family attends their funeral. After the funeral, Harry gives Michel's brother Eric a ride home. Eric insults Michel and makes fun of his poem. Harry arrives back at the house on his own, claiming Eric thumbed a ride; Michel's daughter sees Harry trying to hide Eric's corpse in the back seat. Harry disposes of the body that night. Amidst all this family tragedy, Michel feels inspired to start writing The Flying Monkeys again but flies into a rage when Claire interrupts his writing. Harry tells Michel that he believes Claire is holding him back. The family has dinner with Plum and Harry again, and Harry tells Plum that Michel insulted her. She runs to the bathroom, crying; Michel goes up to apologize, and Plum kisses him while Harry leaves. Michel apologises to Claire and is inspired by Harry's favourite food to write a more personal story called The Eggs. In the night, Harry returns, killing Plum and enlisting Michel for help disposing of her body in the well. When Michel realise Harry plans to do the same to Claire, he stabs Harry with a knife and drops his body down the same well. Michel stays up all night filling in the well, surprising Claire, who also tells him that she read The Eggs and thinks it is brilliant. The film closes as the family goes on another trip in the car Harry bought them.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1962 British Hong Kong, Shanghainese expatriates Chow Mo-wan, a journalist, and Su Li-zhen (Mrs. Chan), a secretary at a shipping company, rent rooms in adjacent apartments. Each has a spouse who often works late, leaving them alone during overtime shifts. Due to the friendly but overbearing presence of Su's Shanghainese landlady, Mrs. Suen, and their bustling, mahjong-playing neighbours, Chow and Su are frequently left alone in their rooms and rarely dine with the other tenants. Although they are initially polite only out of necessity, they grow closer as they realise their spouses are having an affair with each other. Chow notices that his wife owns a handbag available only overseas—one that Su's husband had purchased for her. Su, in turn, observes that her husband wears a tie identical to one Chow owns, a gift from Chow's wife. As they piece together the truth, they begin to reenact how the affair might have started. While both accept that their spouses have betrayed them, they strive to avoid making the same mistake. Chow invites Su to help him write a martial arts serial. Their increased time together draws the attention of their neighbours, prompting Chow to rent a hotel room where they can work in private. As time passes, they acknowledge their growing feelings for each other. They continue reenacting scenes from their spouses' affair, but the emotional toll unsettles Su. They sometimes stop speaking, only to reconnect again later. When Chow receives a job offer in Singapore, he asks Su to come with him. She agrees, but arrives at the hotel too late and breaks down in his empty room. The following year, in Singapore, Chow tells a friend an old story: when someone had a secret, they would climb a mountain, carve a hollow in a tree, whisper the secret into it, and seal it with mud. Su later visits Chow's apartment in Singapore. She calls him but says nothing when he answers. Afterward, Chow notices a lipstick-stained cigarette butt in his ashtray and realises she had been there. Three years later, Su visits Mrs. Suen, who is preparing to emigrate to the United States, and inquires about renting her old apartment. Some time afterward, Chow returns to Hong Kong to visit his former landlords, the Koos, who have moved to the Philippines. He asks about the Suen family next door, and the new owner informs him that a woman and her son now live there. Chow leaves, unaware that Su and her young son are now living in the apartment next door. During the Vietnam War, Chow travels to Cambodia and visits Angkor Wat. As a monk looks on, he whispers into a hollow in a wall and seals it with mud.",

    "film_title": "Nurse Betty",
    "Synopsis": "In the small Kansas town of Fair Oaks, diner waitress Betty Sizemore is a fan of the soap opera A Reason to Love. She has no idea that her husband Del, a car salesman, is having a sexual affair with another woman, his secretary. She also doesn't know that her husband supplements his income by selling drugs. When Betty calls to ask about borrowing a Buick LeSabre for her birthday, Del tells her to take a different car. She manages to get the Buick's key and drives off, unaware that a large stash of drugs is hidden in the trunk. Two hitmen, Charlie and Wesley, come to Betty and Del's house. Charlie threatens to scalp Del if he doesn't reveal where the drugs are, and Del reveals that he has hidden the drugs in the trunk of a Buick; Wesley then scalps Del after misunderstanding Charlie's silent communication. The appalled Charlie shoots Del dead. Betty witnesses the murder and enters a fugue state, assuming the identity of a character in A Reason to Love who is a nurse. That evening, Sheriff Eldon Ballard, local reporter Roy Ostery, and several policemen examine the crime scene while Betty calmly packs a suitcase. She seems nonchalant about the murder, even with the investigation going on right in her house. At the police station, a psychiatrist examines her. Betty spends the night at her friend's house, sleeping in a child's bedroom. In the middle of the night, she gets into the LeSabre and drives off. She stops at a bar in Williams, Arizona, where the bartender talks about her vacation in Rome; Betty tells her that she was once engaged to a famous surgeon (describing the lead character from A Reason to Love). Meanwhile, the two hitmen are in pursuit, having learned that Betty saw Del's killing, and having realized that she probably has the car with the drugs. As they search, Charlie's heart begins to soften towards Betty, to Wesley's consternation. In Los Angeles, Betty tries to get a job as a nurse while looking for her long-lost \"ex-fiancé\". She is turned down because she has no resume or references, but when she saves a young shooting victim's life with a technique she learned from the show, the hospital offers her a job in the pharmacy but forbids her to touch any more patients. Despite her position, Betty becomes popular with patients and their families. She ends up living with Rosa, the older sister of the young man she helped earlier, in gratitude for saving his life. Rosa is also a legal secretary and offers to help Betty find her surgeon boyfriend. She learns from a colleague that \"David\" is a soap opera character, and goes to the pharmacy window to confront Betty. Thinking her friend is jealous, Betty is impervious to the revelation. Betty's lawyer supplies tickets to a charity function where George McCord, the actor portraying David, will be appearing. Betty meets George at the function. George is inclined to dismiss her as an over-imaginative fan, but something about her compels him to talk to her. He begins to think that Betty is an actress determined to get a part in A Reason to Love, so he decides to play along. After three hours of her \"staying in character\", he takes her home. George begins falling in love with Betty, and he and his producer decide to bring her onto the show as a new character: Nurse Betty. When Betty arrives on set, she falls out of her fantasy world and into real life. After two failed takes, she realizes that she is on a set and that the people she thought were real are just characters. George confronts her and Betty walks out. Back at Rosa's house, Betty is telling her roommate what happened when the two hitmen walk in and take Betty and Rosa hostage at gunpoint. Charlie and Wesley tie up the two women and are subsequently interrupted by Roy and Sheriff Ballard, who have also tracked down Betty. A standoff ensues until Ballard pulls a gun from an ankle holster and shoots Wesley dead, who is revealed to be Charlie's son. Charlie decides not to kill Betty and commits suicide in the bathroom. George apologizes to Betty and offers her a job on the show, while Roy and Rosa become a couple. Betty appears in 63 episodes of A Reason to Love and takes a vacation in Rome. Betty later plans to pursue nursing as a career.",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- The manual of style (MOS:FILMPLOT) – and the how-to-guide (MOS:PLOTLENGTH) recommend that editors try to keep the plot within 700 words. --> Three convicts, Pete, Delmar and leader Ulysses Everett McGill, escape from a chain gang to retrieve a buried treasure before the area is flooded to make a lake. The three get a lift from a blind man driving a handcar on a railroad. He tells them they will find a fortune, but not the one they seek. The trio make their way to the house of Wash, Pete's cousin, who breaks off their shackles and feeds them. They sleep in the barn, but Wash reports them to Sheriff Cooley, who, along with his men, torches the barn. Wash's son helps them escape. The next day, Pete and Delmar get baptized in a river, but Everett refuses to join them. They pick up Tommy Johnson, a young black man who claims he sold his soul to the devil in exchange for the ability to play the guitar. In need of money, the four stop at a radio station where they record a song as the Soggy Bottom Boys. That night, the trio part ways with Tommy after their car is discovered by the police, and they briefly fall in with outlaw Baby Face Nelson. Unbeknownst to them, the recording becomes a major hit. Near a river, the group hears singing and finds three sultry women washing clothes. The women give them corn whiskey and they lose consciousness. Upon waking, Delmar finds Pete's clothes lying next to him, empty except for a toad. Delmar is convinced the women were Sirens who transformed Pete into the toad. Later, one-eyed Bible salesman Big Dan invites them for a picnic lunch, then mugs them and kills the toad. On their way to Everett's hometown, Everett and Delmar see Pete working on a chain gang. Upon arriving Everett confronts his wife Penny, who has changed her last name and told his daughters he was dead. He gets into a fight with Vernon, her new \"suitor\". Later that night, they sneak into Pete's holding cell and free him. As it turns out, the women were undercover bounty hunters who had dragged Pete away and turned him in to the authorities. Under torture, Pete gave away the treasure's location to the police. Everett then confesses that there is no treasure. He made it up to persuade the men with whom he was chained to escape with him in order to stop his wife from getting remarried. Pete is enraged at Everett, because he had two weeks left on his original sentence, and will likely face fifty more years for the escape. The trio stumble upon a Ku Klux Klan rally, the Klansmen are planning to lynch Tommy. The trio disguise themselves as Klansmen and attempt to rescue Tommy. However, Big Dan, a Klan member, reveals their identities. Chaos ensues, and the Grand Wizard reveals his identity by stating that he is Homer Stokes, a candidate in the upcoming gubernatorial election. The trio rush Tommy away and cut the supports of a large burning cross, immolating Big Dan. Everett persuades Pete, Delmar and Tommy to help him win his wife back. They sneak into a Stokes campaign gala dinner which she is attending, disguised as hillbilly musicians. The group begins a performance of their radio hit. The crowd recognizes the song and goes wild. Homer recognizes them as the group who humiliated his mob. When he demands the group be arrested and reveals his white supremacist views, the crowd runs him out of town on a rail. Pappy O'Daniel, the incumbent candidate, seizes the opportunity, endorses the Soggy Bottom Boys and grants them full pardons. Penny agrees to remarry Everett with the condition that he find her original ring. The next morning, the group sets out to retrieve the ring, which is in a cabin in the valley which Everett had previously claimed was the location where his treasure was buried. The police, having learned of the place from Pete, arrest the group. Dismissing their claims of having received pardons, Sheriff Cooley orders their hanging. As Everett prays to God, the valley is flooded and they are saved. Tommy finds the ring in a desk that floats by, and they return to town. However, when Everett presents the ring to Penny, it turns out it was her aunt's ring. She declares that she will not marry him with that ring, but only her wedding ring, which is still lost. As the film ends, the blind man on the handcar is seen once more.",

    "Synopsis": "Uninterested in the pottery business, Jean Barnery is ordained as a pastor and marries Nathalie, a woman quite unsuited to the role. When her behaviour with another man excites comment, he sends her and their daughter Aline away with an allowance. When people start commenting that it is worse for a pastor to have a separated wife open to any mischief, he brings her back to the marital home. Then he meets Pauline Pommerel and loses his heart to her. He divorces Nathalie, gives up his calling, marries Pauline, and they move to a rural chalet in Switzerland, where they have a son they name Max. Though the three live simply on income from Jean's shares and are very happy together, as a divorced and unemployed ex-pastor Jean is despised in the conservative local community. The Barnery business is faltering, and none of the next generation have the clout to run it. When Jean is sounded out, he immediately accepts to be managing director with a mandate to innovate. Pauline is miserable, knowing that being at the top of any business is tough and that a family business is tougher still, but loyally goes along with his choice. Come the 1914 War, Jean takes no advantage of exemption for health, though weakened by tuberculosis, and serves throughout at the front, while Pauline nurses wounded soldiers. Come the peace, he tries to improve quality and efficiency at the factory and to expand sales in the USA, but profits remain elusive and labour relations tense. While young Max seems on the way to playing a role in the business, his daughter Aline goes off the rails with smoking, drinking, dancing, and staying out all night. Then, in a volte-face, the young woman accepts ordination as a Protestant deaconess. The 1929 Slump makes things far worse. Showing an American visitor round the works, Jean has a fall and from then on is confined to his bed, where he eventually dies. In his last moments, he confesses to Pauline that most of his life's effort was in vain and that the one true thing was his love for her.",

Maggie has a very close relationship with her millionaire father Adam, a widowed tycoon living in England who plans a museum in the United States to house his collection of art and antiquities. Unbeknownst to his fiancée and prior to their engagement, Amerigo had a brief, passionate affair with Maggie's friend Charlotte. Both were penniless, and Amerigo breaks off their affair when he becomes engaged. Charlotte is still in love with him when she visits mutual friend Fanny Assingham in London. Maggie invites her to the wedding, and at Maggie's request, Amerigo takes Charlotte to an antiques shop to look for a wedding gift. The proprietor Jarvis shows them a bowl, carved from a single piece of rock crystal, which he asserts is flawless. Amerigo notices a crack. Charlotte claims not to see the crack, only the bowl's beauty. She is unsure whether to buy the bowl so Jarvis reserves it pending her decision. Maggie and Amerigo marry and have a son. Adam and Charlotte also marry, much to Maggie's delight. Three years pass and the two couples' lives are closely interwoven. Maggie and Adam's closeness alienates their spouses. Fanny correctly suspects that Amerigo and Charlotte have rekindled their affair. Maggie also becomes suspicious and confides in Fanny, but Fanny, wanting to protect Maggie's feelings, tries to discourage such thoughts. Adam observes close interactions between Charlotte and Amerigo but stays silent, not wanting Maggie to be hurt. Maggie looks for a birthday gift for her father in Jarvis's shop, and chooses the bowl Jarvis had set aside for Charlotte years ago. Jarvis delivers it to her home. While there, he recognizes photographs of Amerigo and Charlotte and innocently reveals they were the couple who originally considered purchasing the bowl before the wedding. Maggie realizes that the two were not meeting for the first time, as she had always assumed, and vents her feelings to Fanny. Fanny breaks the glass bowl, saying it is the only proof of Amerigo and Charlotte being together, and she can pretend nothing happened. Maggie confronts Amerigo, who confesses. Maggie says the bowl represents their marriage, it appeared beautiful and perfect but was flawed. Amerigo begs Maggie not tell her father and not to leave. Maggie agrees not to tell her father for fear of hurting him, but is unsure how she feels about her husband. Adam is distant, and suggests to Charlotte that they return to the United States for the opening of his museum. She is strongly opposed. Tension grows when Amerigo and Maggie arrive with the Assinghams. Amerigo is distant to Charlotte, who worries that Adam and Maggie know of the affair. Maggie and Adam agree to move apart from each other to protect their families. Maggie and Amerigo prepare for a permanent move to Italy, while Adam puts Charlotte in charge of packing the artifacts in preparation for their move to America. Charlotte begs Amerigo to run away with her but he rejects the idea and expresses guilt at being unfaithful and lying to his wife. Charlotte reconciles to being with Adam, and the film ends with the couple arriving to fanfare in an American city.",

    "Synopsis": "Leo Handler visits his mother Val's house in Queens, New York, where she throws a surprise party celebrating his parole. There he meets up with Willie Gutierrez, his cousin Erica Soltz's boyfriend, who thanks him for serving time in prison, implying that Leo had taken a fall for their gang of friends. Eager to support Val, who has a heart condition, Leo follows Willie's suggestion of working for Erica's stepfather, Frank Olchin. The next day, at the offices of his railway car repair company, the Electric Rail Corporation, in Maspeth, Frank offers to help finance Leo's studies during a 2-year machinist program. Needing work immediately, Leo asks if Willie could be allowed to join the company, but Frank declines. Willie commiserates with Leo that night at a nightclub, saying Frank also unsuccessfully tried to get him into a machinist program. At Brooklyn Borough Hall, Willie explains the inherent corruption in the contract system for repair work on the subways. After a hearing to award contracts, Hector Gallardo, co-owner of the Puerto Rican-owned Weltech Corporation, a minority company, approaches Willie about leaving Frank's firm for his. Willie declines and instead brings Leo with him to Roosevelt Island, where he bribes an official charged with awarding contracts. One night, Willie brings Leo to the Sunnyside repair yards, where he and his crew sabotage Weltech's work, hoping to lower their quality rating and lessen their ability to get contracts. Leo is instructed to stand watch while the crew sabotages the train couplings. Willie enters yard master Elliot Gorwitz's office to pay him off with Knicks tickets, but is ordered to remove his crew from the tracks, as Gallardo has already brought him $2,000 in cash. Gorwitz activates the alarm, which draws police officer Jerry Rifkin to the scene. Terrified of potentially returning to prison, Leo attempts escape, but when Rifkin starts assaulting him with his night stick, Leo beats him into unconsciousness. As he escapes, he witnesses Willie fatally stabbing Gorwitz. With Rifkin in a coma at a hospital, the crew orders Leo to murder him to prevent him from identifying Leo when he awakens, but Leo is unable to do it. Upon awakening, Rifkin identifies Leo as his attacker, triggering a broad manhunt. The police, assuming Leo also killed Gorwitz, raid Val's apartment, causing her to suffer from a near-fatal heart attack. Despite being instructed by Willie to keep a low profile, Leo emerges from hiding to visit a sick Val. While he is tending to her, Erica discovers Willie was with Leo at the yards and realizes he was the one who murdered Gorwitz, consequently ending her romantic relationship with him. Frank disowns Willie, who tries unsuccessfully to accept a deal offered to him earlier by Gallardo for protection. Erica implores Frank to help, but instead Leo realizes that Frank is prepared to kill him. With no other options available, Leo desperately turns to Gallardo for protection. Accompanied by Gallardo's lawyers, Leo turns himself in at a public hearing into the rail yard incident and contract corruption. Realizing that Rifkin's testimony against Leo is in no one's interest, Frank and Gallardo negotiate a new split of the contracts with Queens Borough President Arthur Mydanick in a backroom deal. Willie visits Erica, wanting to reconcile with her, and disturbingly reveals to her that according to Frank, she and Leo had been in a romantic relationship when they were younger, and once were caught having sexual intercourse. Fearing his temper and jealousy, Erica triggers the silent house alarm. Willie frantically attempts to embrace her to avoid being exposed as unsuitable, but as she pulls away from him, he unintentionally throws Erica off the second floor landing to her death. Outside the house, he surrenders to the police, who have immediately responded to the alarm. Police arrive at the hearing to inform Erica's mother Kitty and Frank of Erica's death. After Erica's funeral, Frank pulls Leo aside to promise help in the future, if he abstains from testifying at a hearing by the Attorney General, but Leo disgustedly rejects his offer. He ultimately testifies against Frank, Arthur, Willie, and the others involved in the political corruption surrounding The Yards, before departing from Queens on the elevated train.",

    "Synopsis": "The Jian family—father NJ, mother Min-Min, daughter Ting-Ting, son Yang-Yang—is a middle-class family in Taipei. At the wedding of Min-Min's younger brother A-Di, NJ runs into his ex-girlfriend Sherry, who gives him her number before leaving. Sherry is married to an American and lives in Chicago. After the reception, Min-Min's mother, who lives with the family, suffers a stroke that leaves her comatose. She is put on life support and the doctor urges the Jians to talk to her daily. NJ is dissatisfied with his job, and his company is struggling financially. To secure a client named Mr. Ota, NJ's colleagues ask him to take Ota out for dinner, to which he reluctantly agrees. They get along well and NJ takes Ota to a bar, where Ota sings and plays the piano. That night, NJ phones and leaves a message for Sherry, apologizing for leaving her abruptly 30 years ago. Meanwhile, Min-Min becomes depressed by her mother's condition and leaves for a remote Buddhist retreat. After a failed investment, A-Di is kicked out of the house and asks his ex-girlfriend Yun-Yun for help. A-Di is allowed to return upon the birth of his child but a fight breaks out at the baby shower when Yun-Yun shows up uninvited. A-Di and his wife reconcile after she discovers him passed out due to a gas leak at their house. Ting-Ting feels guilty because her grandmother collapsed while taking out the trash Ting-Ting was supposed to take out. She befriends her new neighbor, Lili. After Lili breaks up with her boyfriend Fatty, he begins to relay letters for Lili through Ting-Ting. Fatty soon becomes attracted to Ting-Ting and asks her out. After their second date, the two check into a hotel room, but they hesitate and leave. Later, Ting-Ting sees Lili back together with Fatty and is later berated by Fatty himself. Ting-Ting becomes depressed and talks to her grandmother, asking her to wake up. She learns the next day that Fatty has been arrested for killing Lili's teacher, who was in a sexual relationship with both Lili and her mother. At home, Ting-Ting dreams of being comforted by her grandmother. Unwilling to speak to his grandmother because he feels like she cannot hear him, Yang-Yang starts taking photographs. To punish him for leaving school to buy film, Yang-Yang is forced to face a wall while his teacher circulates his photographs among the other students. Later, after seeing the girl who torments him (because she likes him) swimming, Yang-Yang teaches himself how to swim to learn more about his tormenter. NJ is sent by his company to Tokyo to continue talks with Ota; Sherry also flies to Japan. The two reunite and recount their past; Sherry remains affected by NJ's abrupt departure and NJ attempts to resolve their tensions. They travel to another city and check into a hotel, but when NJ rejects Sherry's requests that they start a new life together, Sherry berates him and breaks down. They return to Tokyo and check back into their respective rooms; before leaving, NJ tells Sherry that he has never loved anyone else. The next day, NJ is informed by his colleague that they have secured a deal with another client and he is to return to Taipei immediately. In response, NJ berates his colleague for abandoning Ota. Later, NJ goes to check on Sherry's room, learning that she has already checked out. Upon her mother's death, Min-Min returns home and is reunited with her family. At the funeral, NJ's colleague urges him to come back to work, but he refuses. In front of her shrine, Yang-Yang recites an intimate monologue. He recounts their time together, his hope of finding where she went, and a desire to \"tell people what they don't know, show them what they can't see.\" He concludes his poem by saying how his newborn cousin reminds him of her, always saying she is old, as he always wanted to say along with her, \"I am old too.\"",

    "Synopsis": "Three years ago, members of a cult sabotaged Tokyo's water supply, killing hundreds and poisoning thousands, before committing mass suicide on the outskirts of town and having their ashes supposedly dispersed by a lake. On the anniversary of the attack, four members of the families of the perpetrators make the trek to that lake to remember them. When they arrive, they find that a motorcycle was there parked before them. At the dock, they see a former member of the cult, Sakata, who had trained for the attack but had defected at the last minute. He is distant and doesn't interact with them. At the end of the day, they return to their vehicle only to find it missing. While they are discussing what to do as night approaches, Sakata comes and, finding that his motorcycle is also missing, leads them to the cabin where he and the deceased cult members stayed prior to the attack, and they pass the night reminiscing about people they have known and lost. Flashbacks illuminate the moments when the cult members told their families about leaving the real world to join the cult, Sakata's time with the cult and eventual escape, and the ensuing police investigation after the attack. Sakata and Atsushi talk about Yûko, Atsushi's sister, whom Sakata had a very close relationship with and had asked to run away with him the night before the attack. Atsushi, according to Sakata, looks nothing like Yûko. The next morning, they return by train to the city. On the train ride back, Sakata asks Atsushi who he really is, saying that Yuko told him her brother had killed himself a few years before. Atsushi says she was probably lying, and Sakata replies that she would not have said it that way if she were lying. When Atsushi goes to see the old man he had been visiting in the hospital, the man has died. The nurse says that she had thought Atsushi was the old man's son, as he visited often, until the old man's actual son had come to the hospital after his death. The film ends with Atsushi returning to the lake and dropping two flowers, one for his father, implied to be the cult leader, and one for his sister, while Sataka burns Yûko's family photos and memorabilia close by. The fire grows larger, and becomes a large conflagration as Atsushi walks away, leaving his past behind.",

    "Synopsis": "The film opens in a theater where Eugène Ionesco's Exit the King is staged. Gilbert Valence, playing the King on stage, is a distinguished actor of theater. In his dressing room he receives the shocking news that his wife, daughter, and son-in-law have been killed in a car accident, and he must bring up their little boy on his own. As time passes, Valence is apparently over his grief. He busies himself with his daily life in Paris and, with help from his housekeeper, looks after his 9-year-old grandson Serge. We see that he plays Prospero in a French language version of William Shakespeare's The Tempest. As a grand old man of the theater, he turns down well-paying roles in low-brow television productions. However, when an American filmmaker John Crawford urgently needs an actor to play young Irishman Buck Mulligan, in a film adaptation of James Joyce's Ulysses to be shot in Paris (in English) in three days, he was pushed into accepting the role. The result of this obvious miscasting becomes apparent during the shoot, and Vance, sensing the language barrier, his ill-preparation and old age, finds himself saying \"Je rentre à la maison\" and leaving the film set.",

    "film_title": "In Praise of Love (film)",
    "Synopsis": "The first half of the film, shot on black and white film, follows a man named Edgar who is working on an undefined \"project\" about what he considers the four stages of love: meeting, physical passion, separation, and reconciliation, involving people at three different stages of life: youth, adulthood, and old age. Edgar keeps flipping through the pages of an empty book, staring intently as if waiting for words to appear. He is unsure whether the project should be a novel, a play, an opera, or a film. In Paris, he interviews potential participants from all walks of life (including those people Victor Hugo dubbed les misérables, whom Edgar considers important to the project), but is continually dissatisfied. The person Edgar really wants is someone he met two years ago, a woman who \"dared speak her mind.\" At the urging of his financial backer Mr. Rosenthal, an art dealer whose father once owned a gallery with Edgar's grandfather, Edgar tracks down the woman, named Berthe, where she is working at night cleaning passenger cars at a railroad depot. Berthe remembers Edgar (and marvels at his memory) but emphatically does not want to be involved in his project. She holds down several jobs and also cares for her three-year-old son. Edgar continues to interview people, to his continuing dissatisfaction. He is able to visualize the stages of youth and old age but keeps having trouble with adulthood. Edgar runs into Berthe at a lecture at a Parisian bookstore by expatriate American journalist Mark Hunter about the Kosovo War. Edgar makes it a point to tell Berthe that Hunter is an example of a \"good American.\" Afterwards, the two wander the city of signs and monuments, talking through the night and into the next day, eventually stopping at an abandoned Renault plant, where they contemplate the collapse of the workers movement. They part company, and later Berthe speaks with Edgar over the phone; they talk about when they first met and she questions him as to why he has stopped talking about his project. They end the conversation with an air of finality. Edgar visits a homeless shelter and selects a man sleeping in one of the beds. In a tender but brief moment, Edgar directs two young people, to whom he had earlier assigned the roles of Perceval and his love Eglantine, to bathe the man in a shower. Mr. Rosenthal is there to witness the scene, but the status of \"the project\" is unclear. In the final scene of the black and white section, Edgar goes to meet a man who has some news for him about Berthe. The second section of the film is shot in DV video with over-saturated color. An intertitle announces that it is two years earlier. Edgar arrives in Brittany and is met by the same man he has just seen at the end of part one. The man, a minister of culture for the area, is there to take Edgar to meet Jean Lacouture, whom Edgar proceeds to interview about the role of Catholics in the French Resistance, in connection with a cantata he is writing for Simone Weil. This encounter leads Edgar to meet an elderly couple who fought in the Resistance and have been together ever since. The couple is meeting with delegates from the American state department who are helping to broker a deal on behalf of \"Spielberg Associates.\" The company wants to purchase the rights to the couple's story for a film written by William Styron and starring Juliette Binoche. The couple's granddaughter, in training to be a lawyer, is attempting to get them out of the contract, as they are afraid they have been shortchanged. The granddaughter is Berthe, and this is when she and Edgar first meet. Berthe attempts to nullify the contract by arguing that the signatories are not members of a defined nation, referring to themselves simply as \"Americans,\" when \"America\" is a term that encompasses two continents with many countries – but it is a futile effort. After spending time with Berthe, Edgar takes the train back to Paris, and reflects on his encounters. When you think of something (\"de quelque chose\"), he muses, you are always thinking of something else. If you see a landscape that is new to you, for example, you are comparing it to a landscape you already know. What Edgar cannot know is what awaits him in the future, about which he is informed at the end of the first part of the film – that Berthe commits suicide.",

Brigands rob them along the road to Kandahar. They decide to return to Iran, but Nafas must continue on her mission to save her maimed sister from suicide. She pays Khak, a boy recently expelled from a Qur'anic school, to be her guide. When Nafas gets sick from drinking unsanitized well water, Khak brings her to a village doctor. The doctor reveals himself to be an African American convert to Islam, who wears a fake beard (which he calls \"a man's burqa\") because he can't grow one. Fearing to be discovered, he dismisses Khak, and the doctor takes Nafas by horse cart to her sister. Along the way, he confides that he has no formal medical training and has become disillusioned with the turn the country has taken under the Taliban. Along her journey, Nafas records her impressions into a portable tape recorder. The country has allowed technological progress only in weaponry. Nafas learns more and more about the hardships women face; and even more so, how years of war have destroyed Afghan society. She sees children robbing corpses to survive, people fighting over artificial limbs that they might need in case they walk through a minefield, and doctors who examine female patients from behind a curtain with a hole in it. When the doctor turns back because he is afraid to enter Kandahar, she follows a man wearing a burqa who scammed a pair of artificial legs out of the Red Cross. The pair join a wedding party which is stopped by the Taliban because they are singing and playing instruments, which is forbidden by Taliban law. Her guide is unveiled and taken away. Nafas is cleared by the Taliban patrol to continue, along with other members of the wedding party. In the end, Nafas is within sight of Kandahar at sunset, but she is now a prisoner of the veil.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1900 in Paris, Christian, a young writer depressed and grief-stricken about the recent death of the woman he loved, begins writing their story on his typewriter. A year earlier in 1899, he arrives in the Montmartre district of Paris to join the Bohemian movement. He suddenly meets Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and his troupe of performers who are writing a play called Spectacular Spectacular. After Christian helps them complete the play, they go to the Moulin Rouge where they hope Christian's talents will impress Satine, the star performer and courtesan, who will in turn convince Harold Zidler, the proprietor of the Moulin Rouge, to let Christian write the show. However, Zidler plans to have the wealthy, powerful and unscrupulous Duke of Monroth sleep with Satine in exchange for potential financing to convert the club into a theater. That night, Satine mistakes Christian for the Duke and attempts to seduce him by dancing with him before retiring to her chamber with him to discuss things privately, but eventually Christian reveals his true identity. After the Duke interrupts them, Satine claims that the two of them and the Bohemians were rehearsing Spectacular Spectacular. Aided by Zidler, Christian and the Bohemians improvise a story for the Duke about a beautiful Indian courtesan who falls in love with a poor sitar player she mistook for a wealthy but evil maharaja. Approving the story, the Duke agrees to invest, but only if Satine and the Moulin Rouge are turned over to him. Later, Satine claims not to be in love with Christian, but he eventually wears down her resolve and they kiss. During construction at the Moulin Rouge, Christian and Satine's love deepens while the Duke becomes frustrated with all the time he thinks Satine is spending with Christian working on the play. To calm him, Zidler arranges for Satine to spend the night with the Duke and angrily tells her to end her affair with Christian. She misses the dinner when she falls unconscious, leading a doctor to diagnose a fatal case of consumption. She does try to end things by telling Christian that their relationship is endangering the production, but Christian writes a secret song to include in the show that affirms their unending, passionate love. At the final rehearsal, can-can dancer Nini hints to the Duke that the play represents the relationship between him, Christian, and Satine. Enraged, the Duke demands that the show end with the courtesan marrying the maharaja, instead of Christian's ending where she marries the sitar player. Satine promises to spend the night with him after which they will decide on the ending. Ultimately, she fails to seduce the Duke due to her feelings for Christian, and Le Chocolat, one of the cabaret dancers, saves her from the Duke's attempt to rape her. Christian decides that he and Satine should leave the show behind and run away to be together while the Duke vows to kill Christian. Zidler finds Satine in her dressing room packing. He tells her that her illness is fatal, that the Duke is planning on murdering Christian, and that if she wants Christian to live, she must cut him off completely and be with the Duke. Mustering all her acting abilities, she complies, leaving Christian devastated. On the opening night of the show, in front of a full audience, Christian denounces Satine and vows to give her to the Duke before walking off the stage, but Toulouse-Lautrec cries out from the rafters, \"The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.\" This spurs Satine to sing their secret song, causing Christian to change his mind. After Zidler and the company thwart several attempts by the Duke and his bodyguard to kill Christian, the show ends with Christian and Satine proclaiming their love as the Duke permanently storms out of the cabaret. The audience erupts in applause, but Satine collapses after the curtains close. Before dying in his arms, she tells Christian to write their story so she will always be with him. Six months later, the Moulin Rouge has closed down and is in disrepair; Zidler, the Duke, the Diamond Dogs, and the Bohemians are gone; and Christian overcomes his grief by finishing his and Satine's story, declaring their love will live forever.",

    "film_title": "Mulholland Drive (film)",
    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. --> The film opens with brightly lit images of couples dancing the jitterbug, over which a young blonde woman appears smiling and being applauded. This is followed by a point-of-view shot descending toward a pillow as someone lies down. At night on Mulholland Drive, a brunette woman in an elegant evening dress narrowly escapes being shot by her chauffeur when another car crashes into them. Left with amnesia, she wanders into Los Angeles and hides in a vacant apartment. The next morning, she is discovered by Betty Elms, an aspiring actress newly arrived from Deep River, Ontario, to stay at her aunt's place. The brunette adopts the name \"Rita\" after seeing a poster of Rita Hayworth and recalls only that she is in danger. The two become friends and discover a blue key and a large sum of cash in Rita's purse. A man eating at a diner with a friend recounts a nightmare in which he encounters a monstrous figure in the alley behind the diner. When he and his friend go outside to investigate, a homeless person covered in filth suddenly appears from around a corner and stares at him as predicted by his nightmare, and he collapses in shock. Film director Adam Kesher is pressured by mob-connected businessmen to cast an unknown blonde, Camilla Rhodes, in his new project The Sylvia North Story. When he refuses, the mob shuts down production and freezes his accounts. He returns home to find his wife cheating on him, is beaten and thrown out of his house, and rejects a sexual advance from his assistant. A mysterious cowboy warns him to cast Camilla. Elsewhere, incompetent hitman Joe Messing botches a job, killing bystanders. Rita remembers the name \"Diane Selwyn\" and Betty locates her address in a phone book. A seemingly psychic neighbor knocks on the apartment door, warning that \"someone is in trouble\", and the building manager Coco later cautions Betty about letting Rita stay. Betty leaves for an audition, where she performs marvelously; a casting agent is impressed and immediately brings her to Adam's audition for The Sylvia North Story. While Camilla auditions with a dull performance of \"I've Told Ev'ry Little Star\", Betty and Adam share a brief but intense glance before she slips away to keep her promise to meet Rita. Adam agrees to cast Camilla to please the mob. Betty and Rita visit Diane's apartment complex. A neighbor who recently exchanged units with Diane says that she has not been seen in some time and directs them to her apartment. Inside, the two discover a woman's decomposing corpse on the bed. Shaken, they leave. Rita panics and tries to cut off her hair, but Betty disguises her with a blonde wig. That night, they have sex and Betty twice confesses she is in love, though Rita does not respond. They fall asleep, but Rita wakes them both up by chanting \"silencio, no hay banda\" (Spanish for \"silence, there is no band\") in her sleep. Rita insists on visiting Club Silencio, where the host explains that there is no backing band and the performances are all pre-recorded. Betty and Rita cry as Rebekah Del Rio performs a Spanish rendition of \"Crying\", and Betty discovers a blue box in her purse that matches Rita's key. They return to the apartment, where Rita goes to unlock the box before she realizes that Betty has vanished. After unlocking the box, Rita also vanishes. The narrative shifts to Diane, a depressed and struggling actress who looks exactly like Betty. She awakens in the bedroom where the corpse was found, and the neighbor who switched apartments with her comes to pick up her belongings, warning Diane that two detectives have been looking for her. As Diane moves through her morning in a daze, she recalls memories of her former lover Camilla, a femme fatale actress who resembles Rita. These memories include a volatile sexual encounter and breakup, being forced to witness Adam and Camilla kiss in front of her during a film rehearsal, a dinner party at Adam's house where Diane explains that she moved to Los Angeles with money inherited from her late aunt and that she lost the leading role in The Sylvia North Story to Camilla (to whom Adam then announces his engagement), and hiring Joe at the diner to kill Camilla. During the latter, Joe indicates that Diane will receive a blue key as confirmation that the hit was successful. The homeless person behind the diner opens the blue box, releasing a tiny elderly couple who are laughing hysterically the same couple who had accompanied Betty upon her arrival in Los Angeles. In the present, a traumatized Diane stares at the blue key on her coffee table. As she tries to ignore the repeated knocks at her door, she is terrorized by the elderly couple, who had entered from underneath the door and grew back to their full size. She runs into her bedroom and shoots herself, dying in the same position as the corpse discovered earlier. As the room fills with gunsmoke, Betty and Rita are shown smiling at each other. At Club Silencio, a blue-haired woman whispers \"silencio\".",

    "Synopsis": "During the Bosnian War, two wounded soldiers, a Bosniak named Čiki and a Bosnian Serb named Nino, are caught between their lines in no man's land. The two soldiers confront each other in a trench, where they wait for dark. Trading insults at first, they eventually begin to find some common ground. Confounding the situation is another wounded Bosniak soldier named Cera who wakes from unconsciousness. A land mine has been buried beneath him by the Bosnian Serbs; should he make any move, the mine will explode. A French Army sergeant named Marchand, of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), gets involved in an effort to help the three trapped soldiers, despite initial orders to the contrary by high command. UNPROFOR's mission in Bosnia is to guard humanitarian aid convoys, remain neutral, and act as a mere bystander. Fortunately, a British reporter arrives on scene, bringing media pressure to bear that moves the UN high command to swing into action to try to save the soldiers. A row between the stressed out and fatigued Čiki and Nino gradually escalates even after being rescued. Eventually, Čiki shoots Nino and in turn is shot by a UN Peacekeeper. Meanwhile, it is discovered that the mine underneath Cera cannot be defused. The UN high command tries to save face; they lie, saying that Cera has been saved and they leave the area, along with the reporters and everyone else. In reality, Cera is left alone and desolate in the trenches, still immobilized by the mine. Meanwhile, the UN commander has arranged false information to be passed to both Bosnian and Serb forces, in order to make them believe that their enemies will be trying to reoccupy the trench at night (which each side would try to counter with an artillery barrage that will presumably kill Cera and destroy the evidence).",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP: FILMPLOT, plot summaries must be between 400 and 700 words. --> Shrek is an anti-social ogre who loves the solitude of his swamp and enjoys fending off mobs and intruders. One day, his life is interrupted after he inadvertently saves a talkative Donkey from some soldiers, prompting Donkey to forcibly stay with him. Donkey is one of many fairy tale creatures that are being exiled or sold by the dwarfish Lord Farquaad of Duloc to beautify his land. However, the creatures inadvertently end up in the swamp. Angered by the intrusion, Shrek resolves to visit Farquaad and demand that he move the creatures elsewhere, reluctantly allowing Donkey to accompany him as he is the only one who knows where Duloc is. Meanwhile, Farquaad is presented with the Magic Mirror, who tells him that he must marry a princess in order to become king. Farquaad randomly chooses Princess Fiona, who is imprisoned in a castle guarded by a Dragon. Unwilling to rescue Fiona himself, he organizes a tournament in which the winner will receive the \"privilege\" of performing the task on his behalf. When Shrek and Donkey arrive at Duloc, Farquaad announces that whoever kills Shrek will win the tournament; however, Shrek and Donkey defeat Farquaad's knights with relative ease. Amused, Farquaad proclaims them champions, and agrees to relocate the fairy tale creatures if Shrek rescues Fiona. Shrek and Donkey travel to the castle and the Dragon attacks them. Shrek locates Fiona, who is appalled by his lack of romanticism; they flee the castle after rescuing Donkey from the Dragon, who is revealed to be female and has fallen in love with him. When Shrek removes his helmet and reveals he is an ogre, Fiona stubbornly refuses to go to Duloc, demanding Farquaad arrive in person to save her, but Shrek carries Fiona against her will. That night, after setting up camp, and with Fiona alone in a cave, Shrek admits to Donkey that he is anti-social because he grew frustrated over being constantly judged for his appearance. Fiona overhears this and becomes kinder to Shrek. The next day, Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men harass the three, but Fiona easily defeats them in physical combat. Shrek becomes impressed with Fiona, and they begin to fall in love. When the trio nears Duloc, Fiona takes shelter in a windmill for the evening. Donkey enters alone and discovers that Fiona has transformed into an ogress. She explains that during her childhood, she was cursed to transform into an ogress at night but retain her human form during the day. She tells Donkey that only \"true love's kiss\" will break the spell and change her to \"love's true form\". Meanwhile, Shrek is about to confess his feelings to Fiona, when he overhears Fiona referring to herself as an \"ugly beast\". Thinking that she is talking about him, Shrek angrily leaves and returns the next morning with Farquaad. Confused and hurt by Shrek's abrupt hostility, Fiona reluctantly accepts Farquaad's marriage proposal and requests that they be married that day before sunset. Shrek dismisses Donkey and returns to his now vacated swamp, but quickly realizes that he feels miserable without Fiona. Donkey returns and lectures Shrek for jumping to conclusions and reveals that Fiona was not referring to him as an \"ugly beast\", although Donkey does not reveal Fiona's secret to Shrek. The two reconcile, and Donkey summons the Dragon, whom he had reunited with earlier in the day. Shrek and Donkey ride Dragon to Duloc so they can stop the wedding. Shrek interrupts the ceremony just before it ends and expresses his feelings for Fiona. The sun sets, and Fiona transforms into an ogress in front of everyone. Disgusted and enraged, Farquaad orders Shrek to be executed and Fiona re-imprisoned, so that he will still be king by technicality. The two are saved when the Dragon, ridden by Donkey, breaks in and devours Farquaad. Shrek and Fiona kiss, and Fiona's curse is broken; though she remains an ogress, Shrek reassures her that he still finds her beautiful. They marry in the swamp with the fairy tale creatures in attendance, then leave for their honeymoon.",

His wife Doris, a bookkeeper, struggles with a drinking problem, and their marriage is strained. One day, a customer named Creighton Tolliver tells Ed about an investment opportunity in a new technology called dry cleaning. Tolliver persuades Ed to invest $10,000, but Ed, desperate for money, decides to blackmail Doris's boss, \"Big Dave\" Brewster, whom he suspects of having an affair with her. Ed anonymously demands money from Brewster, who embezzles funds from his department store to meet the blackmail demands. However, Brewster soon uncovers the scheme and confronts Ed. After Tolliver implicates Ed in the plan, Brewster beats him to death. In a desperate attempt to protect himself, Ed fatally stabs Brewster with a cigar knife in self-defense. Despite this, the police discover discrepancies in the store’s financial records and arrest Doris, suspecting her of both embezzling the money and murdering Brewster. Ed hires Freddy Riedenschneider, a Sacramento defense attorney, who arrives in town and immediately starts living lavishly on the defense fund Doris’s family raised by mortgaging the barbershop. On the day of Doris’s trial, she is found dead, having hanged herself in her jail cell. It is later revealed that Doris was pregnant when she died, though she and Ed had not been intimate for years. Ed’s world unravels further as Frank, now deeply in debt and consumed by grief, turns to alcohol. Amid the chaos, Ed begins spending time with Rachel \"Birdy\" Abundas, a teenage girl and friend of the family, listening to her play the piano. Ed fantasizes about launching her musical career and becoming her manager, but his dreams are crushed when a music teacher bluntly informs him that Birdy has no talent. On the way home, Birdy makes an overt sexual advance toward Ed, causing him to lose control of his car and crash. Ed wakes up in the hospital to find himself arrested for murder. Tolliver’s body, beaten and found with Ed’s investment contract, leads the police to believe that Ed coerced Doris into embezzling the money and murdered Tolliver when he discovered the scheme. With no resources left, Ed mortgages his house to hire Riedenschneider for his defense. However, during Riedenschneider’s opening statement, Frank attacks Ed in a fit of rage, and the judge declares a mistrial. With his defense in shambles, Ed throws himself at the mercy of the court, but the judge sentences him to death. While awaiting execution on death row, Ed writes his life story to sell to a pulp magazine. One night, he sees a UFO outside the prison, which he walks away from. As Ed is led to the electric chair, he reflects on his life and decisions, finding peace with his past. He regrets nothing and holds hope that, in the afterlife, he and Doris will be free from the imperfections of the mortal world.",

On Adrien's arrival at the ward, all the mirrors are removed and staff are instructed not to give him one, but we see from the faces of others how bad the damage is. Adrien becomes increasingly desperate to see the damage done to his face, even asking a visitor to draw him. Dupeyron ensures that we do not see the horrifying extent of Adrien's injuries until he does - by seeing his reflection in a window. There is a focus on the fleeting romance between Adrien and Clémence, whom he met by chance shortly before the war, and his attempts to find her. When he finally does, she fails to recognise him. Whereas the novel follows the experiences of the group right up to World War II and beyond, the film ends just after the First World War, the final scene being Adrien's chance meeting with his future wife.",

    "Synopsis": "Erika Kohut is a piano professor at the Vienna Music Conservatory who resides in an apartment with her domineering elderly mother. Her late father had been a longstanding resident in a psychiatric asylum. Despite Erika's aloof and assured façade, she is a woman whose sexual repression and loneliness are manifested in her paraphilia, including voyeurism, sadomasochism, and self-harm. At a recital hosted by the Blonskij couple, Erika meets Walter Klemmer, a young aspiring engineer who also plays piano, and who expresses admiration of her talent for classical music. The two share an appreciation for composers Robert Schumann and Franz Schubert, and he attempts to apply to the conservatory to be her pupil. His audition impresses the other professors, but Erika, though visibly moved by his playing, votes against him; she cites his divergent interpretation of the Andantino from Schubert's Sonata in A major, D. 959, and questions his motivations. Despite this, Walter is admitted as Erika's pupil. Meanwhile, another pupil, Anna Schober, struggles with anxiety while pushed by her own ambitious mother. When Erika witnesses Anna and Walter socialising, she slips to an empty coatroom and smashes a glass, hiding the shards inside one of Anna's coat pockets. This cuts Anna's right hand, preventing her from playing at the forthcoming jubilee concert. Erika claims she feels ill at the sight of blood and runs to the bathroom. Walter follows Erika, climbs up and over her stall door, and unlocks it. He passionately kisses her and she responds by repeatedly humiliating and frustrating him. She proceeds to give him a handjob before performing fellatio on him, but abruptly stops when he does not abide by her orders to be silent and to look at her and not to touch her. She tells him she will write him a letter outlining her sexual rulebook for their next meeting. Later at the conservatory, Erika feigns sympathy for Anna's mother, who is distraught over her daughter’s injury. Anna’s mother asks who will fill in for her daughter at the forthcoming concert and Erika replies that she herself will play, as no student would play adequately on such short notice. Walter is increasingly insistent in his desire to initiate a sexual relationship with Erika, but Erika is only willing if he will satisfy her masochistic fantasies. She gives him the letter indicating acts she will consent to. He follows her home and tries to seduce her but she is resistant. She allows him to come inside, where the pair is greeted by Erika’s disgruntled mother. In Erika’s bedroom, Walter attempts to seduce her once more but she insists that he read the letter. He reads the letter aloud, pausing to ask her questions or to get angry with her, while she remains silent. Erika retrieves a box of BDSM paraphernalia from under her bed and takes some of the items out. She asks Walter to think about her request. Walter tells her that she’s sick and he leaves. Later that night, while they lie in bed together, Erika's mother is berating her for letting Walter into her bedroom in the middle of the night. Erika suddenly begins kissing and groping her mother. Her mother resists and tells Erika she is unwell. Erika finds Walter at an ice rink after his ice hockey practice to apologise. She begins to subjugate herself to him in a janitorial closet. Walter says he loves her and they begin to have sex, but Erika is unable to, and vomits while performing fellatio. Later that night, Walter arrives at Erika's apartment and attacks her in the fashion described in her letter. He locks her mother away in her bedroom before proceeding to beat and rape Erika, despite her pleas for him to stop. The next day, Erika brings a large kitchen knife to the concert where she is scheduled to substitute for Anna. When Walter arrives, he enters cheerfully, laughing with his family, and flippantly greets her. Moments before the concert is due to start, Erika calmly stabs herself in the shoulder with the kitchen knife and exits the concert hall into the street.",

    "film_title": "The Pledge (film)",
    "Synopsis": "Aging Reno, Nevada, police detective Jerry Black attends a retirement party hosted by his department during which Captain Pollack presents tickets to Jerry for a fishing trip in Mexico as a gift. The celebration is interrupted by the discovery of a murdered child, Ginny Larsen. Jerry decides to go with another detective, Stan Krolak, to the scene of the crime. Jerry delivers the bad news to Ginny's parents, and the mother, Margaret Larsen, makes Jerry swear on a cross, made by their daughter, that he will find the killer. A suspect, Toby Jay Wadenah, a Native American man with an intellectual disability, is found the next day. Stan uses Toby's disorder to his advantage, convincing him that he killed Ginny. After having confessed to doing so, Toby steals a deputy's gun and commits suicide. An autopsy on Ginny proves that she had consumed chocolate before she died; wrappers found in Toby's truck solidify the likelihood that he killed the little girl, and the case is closed, despite Jerry's suspicions. Still adamant about his pledge to find the killer, Jerry chooses not to go to Mexico and misses his flight. Instead, he visits Ginny's grandmother, Annalise Hansen, who tells him of the many stories that she and Ginny used to read; one tells of an angel who descends from Heaven in order to fly a deceased child over all the places it loved in life, before delivering it to God. Jerry then visits one of Ginny's friends, Becky Fiske, who reveals that she had made friends with a man she called \"The Giant\" shortly before Ginny was killed. Jerry finds a picture Ginny drew of \"The Giant\", but it does not resemble Toby, and features a black station wagon and not the red truck driven by Toby. He takes the drawing with him. Jerry goes to Stan and asks him to reopen the case. Stan refuses but gets Jerry more information about similar cases in the area. Jerry's investigations reveal three local, unsolved cases that bear the same modus operandi as seen with Ginny's, which Toby could not have possibly committed because he was incarcerated at the time. Jerry presents his research and Ginny's drawing to Captain Pollack and Stan, who are doubtful. While fishing, Jerry notices a gas station near the center of the cases. After buying the station, Jerry moves into the house behind it and meets local waitress/bartender Lori, and her daughter, Chrissy. He takes an interest in Chrissy and becomes friends with the small family. One night, Lori shows up at Jerry's house, bruised and battered, and explains that her ex (against whom Lori has a restraining order) attacked her. Jerry, out of concern for their safety, suggests that Lori and Chrissy move in with him temporarily; she agrees. Jerry slowly develops a fatherly relationship with Chrissy and even begins a romance with Lori herself. One day, local pastor Gary Jackson visits Chrissy outside the station. Jerry suspects that Jackson is Ginny's killer after he invites Chrissy to his church. Jerry rushes to the church after Jackson picks her up one day while he is fishing, but finds it was nothing more than a close call, and that Jackson is not the killer. Meanwhile, Chrissy meets a man who drives a black car with a toy porcupine hanging on the rear mirror; porcupines were another aspect of Ginny's drawing that stood out to Jerry. That night, while Jerry is reading a bedtime story to Chrissy, she tells him that she met a \"wizard\" who gave her porcupine candies and told her not to tell anyone about their interaction. (A later scene hints that the chocolates are laced with narcotics.) Chrissy tells Jerry she is supposed to meet the \"wizard\" again the next day at a nearby picnic area. Using Chrissy as bait, Jerry stages a sting operation with Stan's help to catch the killer. However, while on the way to the meeting, the \"wizard\" dies in a car accident; hours later, the SWAT team gives up and leaves Jerry alone. They inform Lori of what is happening. She confronts Jerry angrily about putting Chrissy in danger and breaks up with him. Sometime later, Jerry sits by himself on a bench in front of the ruined gas station. Despondent, destitute, and drunk, Jerry ends up all alone, mumbling to himself that the killer is still out there, unaware that he is actually dead.",

    "Synopsis": "In autumn 1526, during the War of the League of Cognac, Emperor Charles V sends veteran general Georg von Frundsberg with an army of German Landsknechte to march towards Rome. The outnumbered papal armies, commanded by Giovanni de' Medici, try to chase them in the midst of a harsh winter, relying on hit-and-run raids on the Imperial supply trains in order to delay their march. Federico II Gonzaga, the Marquis of Mantua, intent on avoiding war in his domain, allows the Imperial armies to pass through his fortifications at Curtatone, denying passage a few hours later to the papal troops. The Imperial army reaches Ferrara, where Alfonso I d'Este provides Frundsberg with four falconets capable of piercing any type of armor, in exchange for the marriage of his heir to an Imperial princess. The exhausted papal army manages to reach an Imperial detachment at Governolo, where de' Medici intends to capture Frundsberg. In the ensuing skirmish, de' Medici is wounded in the leg by a falconet shot and transported to Mantua. The attempts to cure his infected wound fail and he dies of sepsis. The Imperial armies assault Rome. The film ends straightforwardly with the declaration made after the death of Giovanni de' Medici by the commanders of the armies in Europe of ceasing to use firearms because of their cruelty.",

    "Synopsis": "In Ancona, Giovanni is a therapist whose 17-year-old son, Andrea, is accused of stealing a rare ammonite fossil from his school. Andrea is suspended and protests his innocence. However, he later confesses to his mother, Paola, that he and his friend stole it as a prank and intended to return it before it broke. Giovanni and Andrea make plans to go jogging together, but Giovanni is called to the distant home of a patient who is severely distressed about a possible cancer diagnosis. Instead, Andrea goes scuba diving with a friend and swims into an underwater cave, where he accidentally drowns. Giovanni, Paola, and their daughter Irene are left to mourn. Giovanni investigates the diving equipment model and becomes suspicious that Andrea's was defective. However, Paola reminds him that the verdict was that it was functioning properly. Giovanni, once a distant observer of his patients' struggles, begins having difficulty analyzing them, particularly the one he went to see on the day Andrea died, against whom he shows signs of impatience and hostility. One day, Paola receives a love letter sent to Andrea by a girl named Arianna, whom he had met at a camp. The family does not know Arianna and never knew Andrea had a girlfriend. They realize she does not know Andrea has died and attempt to contact her, eventually inviting her to their home. Giovanni stops by a music store to buy an album, ostensibly for a friend of Andrea, but more for Andrea. A clerk gives him a Brian Eno album. Arianna arrives on her way to a destination and sees Andrea's bedroom. She shows Giovanni photographs Andrea sent her of himself in his room, some of which are very amusing. The family welcomes Arianna and offers to host her in their home, but she informs them she is hitchhiking with her friend Stefano to spend vacation in France. The family offers Arianna and Stefano a short ride, but it lingers to a point where they drive into the night and reach Menton, on the border between Italy and France. Bidding Arianna and Stefano goodbye, the family watches their bus leave Italy and wanders on the beach as a new life awaits them.",

    "Synopsis": "After three years away, the actress Camille returns to Paris in an Italian troupe run by her husband Ugo, who is touring Europe with an Italian-language production of a Luigi Pirandello play Come Tu Mi Vuoi (As You Want Me). Camille is nervous because she still has feelings over leaving her lover Pierre, who she tracks down in a park. He seems unchanged and has still not finished writing his doctoral thesis on Martin Heidegger. While searching privately for a lost Goldoni play, Ugo runs into the attractive Dominique in a library, who advises him to approach a collector. The collector sends him to the private library inherited by Dominique's mother, who warns him that books have disappeared. She is happy for him to browse and Dominique helps him. When she takes him to her bedroom, however, her jealous half-brother Arthur intervenes (it is later revealed that he is her secret lover). Dominique warns Ugo that it is Arthur who steals books to sell. Pierre asks Camille and Ugo to dinner at his flat with his lover Sonia, which proves a disaster as the nervous Camille drinks too much and the jealous Ugo mocks Pierre. When Camille goes round the next day to apologise to Sonia, the two women begin to form a rapport. Now able to be friends with Sonia, Camille is still worried that she has not closed things with Pierre. When she goes to see him, he locks her in a room. Camille escapes by a skylight and barely makes the theatre curtain call of the performance, which Sonia attends. Afterwards in a bar, Arthur pretends to pursue Sonia while taking an impression of her very valuable diamond ring, which he later replaces with a worthless duplicate. In despair at this deceit, Sonia asks Camille for help. She goes round to Arthur's flat and offers him a simple deal: he can choose to either spend the night with her and never see her afterwards, or to have her walk out on the spot. He opts for the night and, once he is asleep, she searches until she finds the ring in the kitchen. Ugo then calls on Pierre and challenges him to a duel, place and weapons to be his choice. When Pierre accepts, he finds that the place is over the flies in the theatre and the weapons are a bottle of vodka each. As Pierre is the first to fall over, Ugo wins. In the meantime, Dominique has found the Goldoni play, not in the library but in the kitchen among her mother's cookbooks. When she brings it to Ugo, roaring drunk after his duel, he says it is so valuable that she must keep it and just give him a photocopy. Camille turns up with the ring and offers it back to Sonia, who says Camille has earned it and must keep it. Reunited and now rich, Camille and Ugo look forward to the next stop on their tour.",

Soon afterwards, Shiang-chyi stops by his stand to buy a dual-time watch, as she is taking a trip to Paris. She likes the watch on Hsiao-kang's wrist, which is out of stock. At first, he refuses to sell his watch, explaining that a recent death in his family would mean bad luck for her. She is persistent and eventually convinces him to sell the watch to her. Hsiao-kang's mother mourns her husband's death; she leaves out food and water for him and thinks that he could be reincarnated. Hsiao-kang watches a film set in Paris, The 400 Blows. During his daily routines, he changes every watch and clock he encounters to Paris time. Meanwhile, in Paris, Shiang-chyi experiences deep loneliness in her hotel room, shops, restaurants, and the subway. Hsiao-kang's mother notices that the clock in her common space has changed time and concludes that her husband is back. She turns off the lights in the house and blocks all the windows. When Hsiao-kang raises a fuss, she tells him that his father’s spirit fears the light, and the two argue.

    "Synopsis": "In 1976 television presenter Tony Wilson sees the Sex Pistols perform at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall for the first time. Inspired, Wilson starts a weekly series of punk rock shows at a Manchester club, where the newly formed Joy Division perform, led by the erratic, brooding Ian Curtis. Wilson founds a record label, Factory Records, and signs Joy Division as the first band; the contract is written in Wilson's blood and gives the Factory artists full control over their music. He hires irascible producer Martin Hannett to record Joy Division, and soon the band and label have a hit record. In 1980, just before Joy Division is to tour the United States, Curtis hangs himself. Joy Division rename themselves New Order and record a hit single, \"Blue Monday\". Wilson opens a nightclub, the Haçienda; business is slow at first, but eventually the club is packed each night. Wilson signs another hit band, Happy Mondays, led by Shaun Ryder, and the ecstasy-fuelled rave culture is born. Despite the apparent success, Factory Records is losing money. Every copy of \"Blue Monday\" sold loses five pence, as the intricate packaging by Peter Saville costs more than the single's sale price. Wilson pays for New Order to record a new album in Ibiza, but after two years, they still have not delivered a record. He pays for the Happy Mondays to record their fourth studio album in Barbados, but Ryder spends all the money on drugs. When Wilson finally receives the album, he finds that Ryder has refused to record vocals, and all the tracks are instrumentals. At the Haçienda, ecstasy use is curbing alcohol sales and attracting gang violence. The Factory partners try to save the business by selling the label to London Records. However, Wilson reveals that the Factory does not hold contracts with any of its artists and, therefore, does not own a catalogue of recordings. This renders the company ultimately worthless and the deal falls through. While smoking marijuana on the roof of Haçienda after its closing night, Wilson has a vision of God, who assures Wilson he has earned a place in history.",

    "film_title": "About Schmidt",
    "Synopsis": "Warren Schmidt is retiring from his position as an actuary with Woodmen of the World, a life insurance company in Omaha, Nebraska. After a retirement dinner, he finds it hard to adjust to his new life, feeling useless. Schmidt sees a television advertisement about a foster program for African children, Childreach, and decides to sponsor a child. He soon receives an information package with a photo of his foster child, a small Tanzanian boy named Ndugu Umbo, to whom he relates his life in a series of letters. Schmidt visits his young successor at the life insurance company to offer his help, but he is politely declined. As he leaves the building, he sees the contents and files of his office set out for the garbage. He describes to Ndugu his longtime alienation from Helen, his wife, who dies from a blood clot in her brain just after their purchase of a Winnebago Adventurer motor home. Jeannie, their daughter, and her fiancé, Randall Hertzel, a waterbed salesman, arrive from Denver. Consoling him at the funeral, she later berates him for taking his wife for granted, refusing to fully pay for the Winnebago, and getting her a cheap casket. He asks her to move back to take care of him, but she refuses. Meanwhile, Randall tries to rope him into a pyramid scheme. Schmidt feels that his daughter could do better than Randall. After they leave, he is overcome by loneliness. When he discovers hidden love letters disclosing Helen's long-ago affair with Ray, a mutual friend, Schmidt collects all her possessions and dumps them next to a clothing donations bin. He then confronts Ray for his betrayal. Deciding to take a journey in the new Winnebago to visit his daughter and convince her not to marry Randall, he tells her he is coming early for the wedding. She makes it clear she does not want him there until right before the ceremony, so Schmidt visits places from his past. At a trailer campground, he is invited to dinner by a friendly and sympathetic couple, John and Vicki Rusk. When John goes for beer, Schmidt makes a pass at Vicki, who tells him to leave. Sitting on the roof of his RV on a starry night, Schmidt forgives his departed wife for her affair, apologizing to her for his own failings. At that moment, he is amazed to see a meteor streak across the sky, taking it as a possible sign from Helen. Feeling full of purpose and energetic renewal, Schmidt arrives in Denver, where he stays at the home of Roberta, Randall's mother. He is appalled by her eccentric, lower-middle-class family and cannot dissuade Jeannie from the marriage. Schmidt throws out his back after sleeping on Randall's waterbed, infuriating Jeannie. Roberta assures him that a soak in her hot tub will help his back, but he flees after she makes a pass at him in the tub. The next day, Schmidt, exhausted from a restless night, attends the wedding and delivers a kind speech at the reception, hiding his disapproval. On his way home, Schmidt composes a letter to Ndugu. He questions his life's accomplishments, lamenting that he will soon be dead, that his life has made no difference to anyone, and that eventually it will be as if he has never existed. A pile of mail is waiting for him at home. Schmidt opens a letter from Tanzania. It is from a nun, who writes that Ndugu is six and unable to read and reply to Schmidt's letters on his own but appreciates them and Schmidt's financial support. An enclosed crayon drawing, of Ndugu and Schmidt holding hands on a sunny day, moves Schmidt to tears.",

    "Synopsis": "Diane de Monx is an executive trying to negotiate a deal to acquire the rights to the productions of a Japanese anime studio, which will soon include three-dimensional hentai, for the French-based Volf Corporation. To facilitate the acquisition, she debilitates her superior, Karen, and assumes control of her portfolio, her business partner Hervé, and her assistant Elise. Elise, however, despises Diane and works to frustrate her negotiations at every opportunity. Diane and Hervé travel to Tokyo to close the deal, and they enjoy a sexual flirtation. Having acquired the rights, the Volf Corporation attempts to enter into a deal for distribution with an American Internet company called Demonlover, represented by Elaine Si Gibril. Diane, however, has actually been a spy all along for Demonlover's main competition, Mangatronics, meeting with a mysterious handler on occasion to pass along information on the Demonlover deal. Meanwhile, Diane discovers that Elaine's company is a front for a website called the Hellfire Club, an interactive torture site on the dark web that broadcasts extreme sadomasochism in real-time. When confronted with these charges, Demonlover praises Hellfire Club but claims no ties to it whatsoever. In order to seal the deal for Mangatronics, Diane is sent by her handler to steal data from the computer in Elaine's hotel room. Before Diane can download the information, Elaine enters the hotel room and notices Diane's presence. A violent struggle ensues, and Diane slashes Elaine's throat with a piece of broken glass before suffocating her with a pillow in a supply closet outside the room. Elaine briefly regains consciousness and bludgeons Diane, before dying due to blood loss. When Diane awakens, she is in Elaine's hotel room, and everything is completely cleaned up. There is no evidence of a murder, burglary, or struggle. Diane subsequently meets with Elise, whom she drives home during a rainstorm. In conversation, Elise implies that Diane should be scared for her life before demanding to be dropped off on the side of the street. Returning to the Volf offices alone, Diane manages to log onto the Hellfire Club website, which displays disturbing footage and images of women being sexually tortured. Karen arrives at the office, and also gives Diane an ominous warning, confirming that Demonlover does indeed own and operate the Hellfire Club website. Karen leaves behind a camcorder tape for Diane to view, which shows Elise and several men cleaning up the crime scene from Elaine's murder, as well as carrying an unconscious Diane back to her room. Diane gleans that Elise is in fact an agent for Demonlover, working under Hervé, who is also a covert associate. Demonlover uses Diane's murder of Elaine as blackmail against her, forcing Diane to acquiesce and become part of the Hellfire Club. Elise escorts Diane to a mansion in the country, where she drugs her. Through flashbacks, it is revealed that Diane also murdered Hervé as he was sexually assaulting her for a second time. Some time later, Diane and Elise are flown by helicopter to a desert locale, where Diane again loses consciousness. When she awakens, she finds herself in a dungeonlike room, on a mattress, dressed in a vinyl suit and with a wig. Beside the mattress there are pictures of Diana Rigg as Mrs. Peel in The Avengers. Diane attempts to escape, and is almost successful. However, upon driving her getaway car she is involved in a car accident. The escape fails. Some time later, in the United States, a teenage boy logs onto the Hellfire Club with his father's credit card. He then fills out a detailed fantasy of what he would like done to the woman on the screen, who turns out to be Diane, bound and wearing a bondage suit. The boy allows his fantasy to play in the background as he completes his science homework, while Diane stares helplessly at the camera from her chamber.",

    "Synopsis": "Divine Intervention while being a series of interconnected sketches, is a glimpse at life of Palestinians living under military occupation going in between the cities of Nazareth and Ramallah. E.S. lives in Nazareth while his father lives in Ramallah. The film begins by focusing on life in Ramallah with the Father for the first part of the film, bouncing between different stories of the neighbors within this area and the conflicts they undergo. Disputes between neighbors, Israeli police coming and going, the seizing of Palestinian owned things and places by the Israeli settlers, Palestinians interacting with/watching one another, etc. In the second part of the film, E.S.'s Father has fallen ill and is in the hospital, he must now enter Ramallah and visit his father. While going in between Nazareth and Ramallah, E.S. begins meeting with The Woman in their cars at the border checkpoint between the two cities. The couple's clandestine meetings continue to take place throughout the rest of the film. Through them, viewers observe the Israeli military guards at the checkpoint as they interact with the Palestinians who are crossing into Nazareth. The film is characterized by a lack of dialogue. The characters of the film are only able to observe the happenings of their everyday life without being able to interfere much as they are under military occupation and must adhere to it. Sketches: In Nazareth, Santa Claus runs away from children as gifts fall from his basket. He's been stabbed and leans against the ruin of a Franciscan chapel atop Mount Fear. E.S.'s Father curses familiar faces as he drives through the streets. Neighbors bicker over small stuff. A Palestinian couple meets in a car at the border checkpoint between Ramallah and Nazareth. More bickering neighbors. A tourist asks an Israeli policeman for directions. Unable to help her himself, the policeman brings out a blindfolded Palestinian prisoner from the back of his van. The Palestinian tells her three different possible routes. The couple is in the car again. The man (E.S.) blows up a red balloon with the face of Yasser Arafat drawn on it. He releases it near an Israeli checkpoint. An Israeli soldier is about to shoot it down but his comrade stops him. In the confusion, the couple are able to drive through the checkpoint together. The balloon floats across Jerusalem, eventually settling against the Dome of the Rock. At night, the couple again in a car. The next morning, five Israeli men practice an elaborate sequence of dance-like moves. Armed with guns, they repeatedly fire at targets painted like a Palestinian woman under the direction of a choreographer-officer. When one of the targets fails to fall to the ground, a real Palestinian woman (dressed like the targets) appears. The officer instructs his men to fire at her. In a supernatural feat, she gathers their bullets in the air around her and rises from the ground. The bullets form a crown of thorns around her head until she lets them fall to the ground. She then uses crescent-adorned stars and rocks to kill all but the officer. A helicopter appears to reinforce the Israelis, which the woman also easily destroys throwing a sheld with the form of Palestine. The dance choreographer watches helplessly and the woman disappears. The film ends with E.S. and his mother watching their dinner cook in a pressure cooker.",

    "Synopsis": ").|source=The film's main message which appears at the end of the original cut when the movie transitions to a strobe effect.}} ).|source=In the Straight Cut, this message—which still appears at the end of the film—differs from the original.}} Alex and Marcus, a young couple, wake up together and discuss their relationship, as well as an upcoming party, while in the nude. Marcus voices concern about Alex's ex Pierre also being invited because he \"stole his girl\", to which Alex responds that he did not steal anything, because she is not an object and it was all her decision. Alex reveals she had a dream of herself standing in a red tunnel that breaks in two. The two talk about a potential pregnancy and Marcus expresses hope in one before Alex takes a pregnancy test, the result of which is never shown, but she seems particularly pleased with. On a public train, Pierre, Alex's ex who is also invited to the party, constantly bickers with Alex over his inability to satisfy her during their relationship, while Marcus shows no interest in their squabble. Alex explains to Pierre that he always focused too much on her, and a sexual partner can feel and is aroused by their partner's pleasure. At the party, Marcus gets drunk and takes cocaine, much to Alex's disapproval. She leaves the party, asking Pierre to look after Marcus. Alex descends into a red pedestrian underpass on her way back to the train when she notices a transgender prostitute getting attacked by a man. He immediately turns his attention to Alex, anally raping her before savagely beating her into unconsciousness. After Marcus and Pierre discover Alex being taken away by paramedics, they encounter street criminals Mourad and Layde, who offer to help them find the culprit. They use an ID left at the scene by the prostitute to locate her. Marcus verbally assaults Concha, the prostitute, and threatens to cut her face open in order to gather that the rapist's name is Le Ténia (\"the tapeworm\") and that he frequents a gay BDSM club called Rectum. The men are chased off by other prostitutes; Marcus and Pierre jump into a taxi cab and speed off into the night. When the cab driver doesn't know where Rectum is, Marcus attacks the driver, stealing his vehicle. The two end up finding Rectum, with Pierre reluctantly following behind Marcus. Leading the charge, Marcus proceeds to get into a fight with a man he suspects of being Le Ténia, who overpowers him and breaks his arm before attempting to rape him. Pierre comes to his rescue and beats the man to death with a nearby fire extinguisher as the man's companion, the actual rapist, watches in amusement. Marcus is carried out of Rectum on a stretcher while Pierre is arrested by police as Mourad and Layde deride them. Meanwhile, in a nearby small apartment, a man named the Butcher tells a friend that he was arrested for raping his daughter before dismissing the commotion going on outside.",

    "film_title": "Kedma (film)",
    "Synopsis": "The film is a historical tragedy set during the opening stages of Israel's 1948 War of Independence. The film takes place in the final stages of the civil war in Mandatory Palestine just before Israeli independence. It follows the fate of a group of Polish-, Russian-, and Yiddish-speaking refugees from the Holocaust who are illegally brought to Israel by the Palmach. When they arrive, they are chased by British soldiers. Once they escape, they are immediately drafted into the war, and take part in a grueling battle against Arab irregulars. Toward its ending, the film centers on two long monologues: one by an Arab peasant (played by Yussuf Abu-Warda) who pledges to oppose the Jews forever, in a reworking of a poem by Tawfiq Ziad; and one by an emotionally demolished refugee who laments the seemingly endless suffering of his people. Gitai intended the film to be a more realistic answer to the romanticized depiction of the war in Otto Preminger's Exodus. The final shot of Kedma, with a trail of military vehicles disappearing into the horizon, is identical to the final shot of Preminger's film.",

    "Synopsis": "Ernesto Picciafuoco, painter and illustrator of children's tales, is a part of a very important but impoverished family, which wants to regain its stature by having a member canonized. ns. The late mother of the protagonist seems to be the only true religious person in the weak and stupid family. Two of the young rebels are now in the 40s and are completely detached from the hypocrisy of religion. One of them pretends to be very religious, to get back his job. The other, the protagonist, is uncertain, beset by moral doubts, mainly because of his young son who could learn the hypocrisy from him. The film is a journey through the absurd and surreal episodes. Ernesto, the protagonist, is contacted by a mysterious cardinal who wants to question him about the process of sanctification of the mother, about which he knew nothing until then. Then the child goes to school for the hearings with teachers, where he meets a young and charming, \"religious teacher\", to whom he is attracted, but that will be an impossibility. He has a discussion with a religious man appointed to investigate circumstances of \"martyrdom\", which asks account the non-baptism of his son, showing that he is well informed about him and trying to know why Ernest had \"lost faith\". Ernesto is then challenged to a duel, for petty reasons, from a noble dream of an improbable restoration of the monarchy, but the duel is interrupted after a few seconds. He talks with his aunt, who has never shown much faith, but now, attracted by possible financial gain and popularity that the family would derive from sanctification, for a purely opportunistic attempt to bring her nephew on the \"right path\". Meanwhile, the wife of Ernesto administers a sort of baptism to the child sleeping, anxious to repair the previous \"non-\". Ernesto's aunt smiles cravingly while awaiting to be seen by his Holiness, with their familial collaborators, all but Ernesto, who prefers to walk with his child to school.",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 to 700 words. --> In Los Angeles, Barry Egan is a bachelor who owns a company that markets themed toilet plungers and other novelty items. He has seven overbearing sisters who regularly ridicule and emotionally abuse him, and he leads a lonely life punctuated by fits of rage and social anxiety. One day, Barry witnesses an inexplicable car accident, picks up an abandoned harmonium from the street, and meets Lena Leonard, a co-worker of Elizabeth, one of his sisters. Lena had orchestrated the meeting after seeing him in Elizabeth's family picture at work. Barry attends his sister's birthday party, where they tease him about his sexuality, leading to a violent outburst in which he breaks sliding glass doors. Afterwards, he privately asks his brother-in-law to refer him to a therapist. At home, Barry calls a phone sex line to cope with his loneliness. The phone sex operator tries to extort money from him and then sends four henchmen, who are brothers, to collect. This complicates his budding relationship with Lena, as well as his plan to exploit a loophole in a Healthy Choice promotion and amass a million frequent-flyer miles by purchasing large quantities of pudding. When Lena leaves for Hawaii on a business trip, Barry decides to follow her. He uses his sister to find Lena, who is overjoyed to see him. As the two spend time together, Barry's sister calls Lena, who lies to her about being in contact with him. The romance develops further, leading to Barry's relief from his emotional isolation. On the return trip, the four brothers ram Barry's car, mildly injuring Lena. After fighting them off with a tire iron, Barry leaves her at the hospital and sets out to end the harassment. He calls the phone sex line back and discovers the \"supervisor\" is the owner of a mattress store. Barry drives all the way to Provo, Utah, to confront the owner, Dean, face to face. At first, trying to intimidate Barry, Dean finds him more intimidating once he learns that he has come all the way from California. They both agree \"that's that\". Returning home, Barry visits Lena to explain why the accident happened. He begs for forgiveness, pledging his loyalty and to use his frequent-flyer miles to accompany her on all future business trips after his pudding miles are processed. Lena confesses she was more upset at being left at the hospital, but forgives Barry and they embrace.",

    "film_title": "Russian Ark",
    "Synopsis": "On a winter's day, a small party of men and women arrive by horse-drawn carriage to a minor side entrance of the Winter Palace, dressed in the style of the early 19th century to attend a ball hosted by the Emperor Alexander I. The narrator (whose point of view is always in first-person) meets another spectral but visible outsider, \"the European\", and follows him through numerous rooms of the palace. \"The European\", a 19th-century French diplomat who appears to be the Marquis de Custine, has nothing but contempt for Russians; he tells the narrator that they are unable to create or appreciate beauty as \"Europeans\" do, as demonstrated by the European treasures around him. Each room manifests a different period of Russian history, although the periods are not in chronological order. Featured are Peter the Great harassing and striking one of his generals; a spectacular presentation of operas and plays in the era of Catherine the Great; an imperial audience in which Tsar Nicholas I is offered a formal apology by the Shah of Persia, represented by his grandson Khosrow Mirza, for the death of ambassador Alexander Griboyedov in 1829; the idyllic family life of Tsar Nicholas II's children; the ceremonial changing of the various regiments of the Imperial Guard; contemporary tourists visiting the palace; the museum's director whispering the need to make repairs during the rule of Joseph Stalin; and a desperate Leningrader making his own coffin during the 900-day siege of the city during World War II. A grand ball follows, held in the Nicholas Hall, with many of the participants in spectacular period costume and a full orchestra conducted by Valery Gergiev featuring music by Mikhail Glinka, then a long final exit with a crowd down the grand staircase. The European tells the narrator that he belongs here, in the world of 1913 where everything is still beautiful and elegant, and does not want to go any further. The narrator then walks backwards out the hallway and sees many people from different time periods exiting the building together. As he watches them, the narrator quietly departs the procession, leaves the building through a side door and looks out upon the River Neva.",

    "Synopsis": "Dennis Cleg is a schizophrenic man who has just been released from a mental institution. Known as \"Spider\", he is given a room in a halfway house catering to mentally disturbed people which is run by unrelenting landlady Mrs. Wilkinson. While in his new abode, Spider starts piecing together his memory of an apparently fateful childhood event. Roaming the nearby derelict urban area and the local canal, Spider starts to relive a period of his childhood in 1950s London with his mother Mrs. Cleg and unfaithful father Bill. Here, Spider witnesses Bill murder his mother by hitting her on the head with a spade with the passive support of his mistress, a prostitute named Yvonne. Much to Spider's horror, she moves into the house and is presented as his \"mother\". Now grown up, Spider begins seeing Mrs. Wilkinson turn into Yvonne. He responds by using strands of yarn to form a web-like construction in his room, and steals Wilkinson's keys to gain access to different rooms. Meanwhile, Spider begins to relive a memory from childhood where he kills Yvonne by using a similar web-like pulley mechanism to turn on the gas in the kitchen. However, it appears to show Mrs. Cleg lying dead instead, implying it really was his mother all along, and Yvonne was actually a delusion. Spider comes to this realization when he sneaks late one night into Mrs. Wilkinson's room, still seeing her alternatively as the mistress, and appears ready to kill her, but backs away after she turns back to normal. He is then taken back to the asylum after she reports him.",

    "Synopsis": "In the Scottish town of Greenock, teenager Liam and his friends exemplify the violent ned subculture: they no longer attend school, and instead wander aimlessly all day long. They earn money by illegally selling untaxed cigarettes in a pub. Liam's mother, Jean, is currently in prison for a crime actually committed by her boyfriend Stan, who works as a drug dealer with Liam's grandfather, Rab. Jean is due to be released in a few weeks, in time for Liam's 16th birthday. Stan and Rab attempt to force Liam to smuggle drugs to Jean during a prison visit. Refusing to cooperate, Liam is beaten up by Stan and eventually thrown out of Rab's flat. Liam then moves in with his older sister Chantelle in nearby Port Glasgow. She urges Liam to do something constructive with his life. When Liam takes Chantelle's young son Calum for a walk along the Greenock Esplanade, his friend Pinball arrives in a stolen car and insists on taking them joyriding along the coast. They drive up through the Cloch caravan park where Liam sees a caravan for sale. Liam dreams of starting afresh by purchasing a caravan to live in with his mother and sister, away from Stan and Rab. To afford it, he and Pinball steal a delivery of drugs from Stan's house and sell them. They soon raise several thousand pounds, which they pay as a deposit towards the caravan in Liam's mother's name. Liam's efforts attract the attention of the local drug \"godfather\", Tony Douglas. Liam agrees to work with them after Tony tells him to \"stay away from our shops\". Pinball, meanwhile, is thrown into the health club showers due to his disrespectful behaviour towards the dealer, and vows revenge. Liam and Pinball continue selling drugs locally, with the help of Liam's other friends who deliver pizzas. Liam and Pinball meet again with members of Tony's gang, and Liam joins them in their car. Pinball is kicked out, angering him further; the gang members advise Liam to \"dump\" Pinball for good. They take Liam to a Glasgow nightclub and inform him that he has to kill someone to join the gang. Liam attempts to do so, but is stopped by the gang, who inform him it was a test—which he has passed. Liam, Chantelle, Calum and Suzanne (Chantelle's friend) drive to the caravan for a picnic, only to discover that it has been burned down. Liam believes Stan did it. That evening, Pinball turns up in Tony's stolen car, telling Liam that he wants revenge. He proceeds to crash the car into the health club. Liam speaks to Tony in the morning and is ordered to kill Pinball. The next morning, Pinball—aware of Liam's intentions—tries to stab Liam, before proudly revealing that he burnt down the caravan. He then cuts his own face in rage. Liam reassures his injured friend after phoning for an ambulance, but he then notifies Tony that the deed has \"been done\", implying that he has indeed murdered Pinball. Tony promises to buy Liam an upscale apartment, and on the day before his birthday, Liam's mother is released from prison and taken to this new house on the coast of Gourock where she is welcomed with a party. She appears uneasy, and the next morning is found to have escaped to Stan's house. Liam blames this on Chantelle, who is now fully aware that Liam is dealing drugs. She attempts to warn him about their mother probably not being so thankful for Liam's efforts because she is too devoted to Stan, but this only provokes Liam further. An enraged Liam goes to Stan's house, trying to convince his mother to return to their new home, only to be insulted by Stan. In a struggle, Liam stabs Stan. Liam walks alone on the beach. He is phoned by Chantelle, who reminds him that it is his 16th birthday on that day, meaning he can be tried in court as an adult. She also tells him that the police have been looking for him, and that despite everything that he has done, Chantelle still loves him. He walks towards the sea.",

    "film_title": "Ten (2002 film)",
    "Synopsis": "The film is divided into ten scenes, each of which depict a conversation between an unchanging female driver (played by Mania Akbari) and a variety of passengers as she drives around Tehran. Her passengers include her young son Amin (played by Akbari's real life child, Amina Maher ), her sister, a bride, a sex worker, and a woman on her way to prayer. The first vignette of the film is a conversation between Amin and his mother, as he is being driven to the local pool. Over the course of their conversation, the driver raises her voice to him and tensions escalate as he yells over her. It is revealed that, due to the limited rights women are given the court system, the driver obtained a divorce from her ex-husband, by falsely telling the court he was a drug addict. After their conversation erupts into a fight, Amin abruptly exits the car. The second vignette features the driver's sister who works as a teacher. They discuss the heavy burden and expectations children place on their parents. Both of their children have accused the women of not being good mothers. They eventually pick up a birthday cake for the driver's husband, Mortaza. The driver's sister advises her regarding Amin's rude behavior and tells her to let Amin live with his father, who will be able to \"set him straight\". During the third vignette, the driver picks up a pious old woman who goes to the Mausoleum three times a day to pray. She reveals that her husband and 12-year-old son have both died. She goes to the Mausoleum to pray for them. She has sold her possessions in order to go on a pilgrimage to Syria and has given away her other possessions to people who are less fortunate than her. Their conversation ends as the driver drops the old woman off at the Mausoleum after she is unable to convince the driver to go in and pray herself. The fourth vignette starts with a sex worker who mistakes the driver for a male client and gets into her car. The driver continues to drive around with the unnamed woman and persists in asking her personal questions. The sex worker, in turn, ends up lecturing the driver. She tells the driver that many of her clients are married men that get calls from their wives while they are with her. She admits to the driver that she feels bad for women who are idiotic enough to cling onto men and who actually believe that men are truthful. The sex worker was engaged to a man once until she realized she was \"foolish\". The conversation ends as she is dropped off and immediately picked up by a client. The fifth vignette features a woman whose relation to the driver is unclear. The woman is picked up just after she has prayed at the Mausoleum. The two women discuss religion and whether or not they are believers. The passenger confesses that she had not been a believer in the past, and now she is not so sure. The passenger tells the driver that she was supposed to get married and she now prays at the Mausoleum with the hope that the man she is dating will propose soon. In the next vignette, the driver picks up Amin from her ex-husband, who has been taking care of him. She and her ex-husband each stay in their cars, leaving Amin to cross a busy traffic-filled street. The driver asks permission to keep Amin overnight and he eventually agrees. Amin disagrees with his mother over a shortcut to his grandmother's house, but eventually realizes his mother is going the right way. Amin tells his mom that his father has been watching porn at home alone at night. The driver next picks up her crying sister who is distraught over her husband leaving after 7 years together. As she cries, the driver tells her, \"It is wrong to cling to him.\" The driver is reciting almost exactly what the sex worker had told her the night before. The driver is very frank and harsh with her sister. She tells her to toughen up and stop being so weak. During the eighth vignette, the driver is with Amin again. She says a woman told her that Amin is a man and therefore needs to live and learn from a man. The driver agrees that Amin should go live with his father, and they have a conversation about her ex-husband finding a new wife. Amin says that his new wife would be better than his mother by obeying her husband, doing more housework, and coming home earlier. They disagree again over a shortcut and soon their argument escalates to the point where Amin abruptly gets out of the car again. The ninth vignette features the same woman from the fifth vignette. She tells the driver that her boyfriend does not want to marry her, despite her hopes that he will. She feels jealous over the fact that he is thinking of another woman and that is what hurts her the most. The driver asks her passenger why her veil is so tight, and it is revealed that the passenger has shaved her head. The final vignette is the shortest. The driver picks up Amin from his father. The film ends as the driver is taking him to his grandma's house.",

    "Synopsis": "A nameless man arrives in Helsinki by train. After falling asleep on a park bench, he is mugged and beaten severely by three hoodlums. He is taken to a hospital where he is pronounced dead, but miraculously revives, fixes his broken nose, and wanders out. He collapses near the harbour and is found by a family living in an abandoned shipping container. The family—Nieminen, his wife Kaisa, and their two sons—nurse him back to health. The man has lost all memory of his identity, including his name and occupation. He begins to rebuild a life among the poor and marginalized residents of the container village. Anttila, a corrupt but helpful security guard, rents him a container. The man tries to find employment but is rejected at the labour exchange because he cannot provide a name or social security number. He visits the Salvation Army for food and clothes, where he meets Irma, a lonely officer. They begin a shy, awkward romance. The man finds work at the Salvation Army's thrift store and revitalizes the organisation's band, introducing rhythm and rock and roll into their gloomy repertoire. While watching workers at the shipyard, the man realizes he possesses welding skills. He secures a trial job but cannot be paid legally without a bank account. When he attempts to open one, a clerk refuses him. During the visit, bank robbers hold up the branch; the man is locked in the vault with the clerk. The police subsequently arrest the man for failing to identify himself. A Salvation Army lawyer assists him, ensuring his release, but the police publish his photo in the newspapers to seek his identity. The man is recognized by his wife in the town of Nurmes, who contacts the police. Irma is heartbroken when she learns he is married. The man travels to Nurmes to meet his past. He learns his name is Jaakko Lujanen and that he was a metalworker. His wife tells him they had already divorced because of his gambling addiction and that she has a new partner. Relieved that he has not abandoned a happy family, he leaves his past behind for good. He returns to Helsinki and Irma. In the harbour, he is confronted by the same thugs who beat him originally. This time, the community of homeless people and dock workers emerges to defend him, chasing the criminals away. The man and Irma walk away together towards the train station as the band plays \"Muistatko Monrepos'n\".",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words. --> In September 1939, Polish-Jewish pianist Władysław Szpilman plays live on the radio in Warsaw when the station is besieged during Nazi Germany's bombing of Warsaw. Szpilman and his family prepare to leave the city when they learn that Britain and France have declared war on Germany. Relieved at the news, Szpilman stays in Warsaw with his family but with Poland’s invasion, Warsaw falls under Nazi occupation. Jews are persecuted by the new government, stripped of privileges and forced to wear blue Star of David armbands. Szpilman and his family sell their belongings, including his piano, to survive. The Szpilmans are forced to abandon their home in late 1940 into the overcrowded Warsaw Ghetto where disease and starvation are rampant. Szpilman performs in a café frequented by upper-class Jews, who smuggle in forbidden goods to live comfortably. Szpilman witnesses a young boy savagely beaten by a guard and left for dead while attempting to escape the ghetto. The boy dies despite Szpilman's attempt to save him. Szpilman and his family also witness the SS murder an entire family while raiding a nearby apartment, in which a wheelchair-using man is thrown off the building. Having failed to obtain legitimate German work certificates, the Szpilmans are ordered to be transported to Treblinka extermination camp in August 1942 as part of Operation Reinhard. Jewish Ghetto Police separates Szpilman from his family at the railhead, allowing him to escape while his family is taken to the death camp. Szpilman becomes a slave labourer and learns of an upcoming Warsaw Ghetto uprising. He smuggles weapons into the ghetto and goes into hiding with help from Andrzej Bogucki and his wife Janina Godlewska. Szpilman watches the uprising unfold and fail in April 1943. When a female neighbor attempts to report Szpilman, he travels to another hiding place in the German quarter from the husband of his friend Dorota. The new apartment has a piano which Szpilman refuses to play to prevent his identity from being discovered. Szpilman suffers from malnourishment and jaundice, and following a final visit from Dorota and her husband, they obtain a doctor to treat him. Szpilman recovers by August 1944 when he witnesses the Warsaw Uprising unfold. When Home Army forces attack the Schutzpolizei hospital across the street from Szpilman's apartment building, his home is destroyed by a German tank. Szpilman narrowly escapes and hides in the now abandoned hospital as Warsaw is destroyed in the fighting. When German troops later attack the hospital with flamethrowers, Szpilman flees through the city's ruins and is discovered by Wehrmacht officer Wilm Hosenfeld, who learns he is a pianist. When Szpilman plays Frédéric Chopin's \"Ballade No. 1 in G minor\" on the house's grand piano, the officer allows him to continue to hide in the house, providing him food. When the Germans retreat from the Soviet offensive in January 1945, Hosenfeld promises Szpilman he will listen to him on Polish Radio after the war and leaves him a large supply of food and his greatcoat. After Warsaw is liberated, Szpilman is nearly killed by People's Army troops who mistake him for a German because of his coat. Hosenfeld is held after the war in a Soviet POW camp. When surviving concentration camp inmates abuse the prisoners, one laments his former career as a violinist. Hosenfeld asks if he knows Szpilman and the violinist promises to bring Szpilman as a character reference but when they return to the site, Hosenfeld and the camp are gone. Szpilman resumes his career, performing Chopin's \"Grande polonaise\" with an orchestra to a large, prestigious audience.",

    "Synopsis": "Olivier (Olivier Gourmet) is an impersonal and stern master carpenter at a youth trade training center. Despite dissatisfaction with his workload, he hesitantly takes on an additional apprentice: Francis Thorion (Morgan Marinne), a boy recently released from juvenile detention for the murder of Olivier’s son five years prior. Olivier takes interest in the boy’s training and follows him home, although Francis is unaware of their connection. He tells his ex-wife Magali (Isabella Soupart), who is remarried and pregnant, that Francis was denied from the center, but that he considered taking the boy on; she is upset by his suggestion. Francis makes an attempt to befriend Olivier, who reacts coldly. Despite this, Olivier steals Francis's keys and sneaks into his barren, impoverished apartment. Later, when Olivier offers to drive Francis home from the center, Magali confronts him, who admits that the boy is her son's murderer. She faints in shock, and when she regains consciousness she asks Olivier why he has taken the boy under his wing. He replies that he does not know. The next day, while taking Francis on a training excursion to a sawmill, Olivier asks about the circumstances of Francis’s detention. Francis is evasive. Despite this, when the pair stops for lunch, Francis asks Olivier to be his guardian. Olivier replies inconclusively. While they play table football, Olivier coaxes Francis to admit that he killed someone. As they continue the drive, Francis confesses that he strangled a boy to death in the process of stealing a car radio. Olivier is briefly angered by Francis's confession and apparent lack of remorse. The pair arrive at the sawmill and work together until Olivier abruptly states that the boy Francis killed was his son. Despite Olivier’s pleas, Francis runs away; worried that Olivier intends to avenge his son, he hides and throws planks at Olivier. Olivier eventually catches Francis and begins to strangle him before letting go. He returns to the mill alone, only for Francis to reappear. The pair silently resumes their work.",

    "Synopsis": "Unknown Pleasures follows three disaffected, aimless young people in the industrial city of Datong in China's Shanxi province throughout 2001. Nineteen-year-old Bin Bin (Zhao Weiwei) lives with his mother, an adherent of the Falun Gong, in a small apartment near Datong's textile mill. Bin Bin's best friend, the reckless Xiao Ji (Wu Qiong), lives in an even smaller apartment with his father, and spends his time riding his motorbike around the city. The two friends eventually meet Qiao Qiao, a young singer and dancer working for the Mongolian King Liquor company as a spokesmodel. Xiao Ji immediately becomes enamored with Qiao Qiao, which gets him in trouble with Qiao Qiao's boyfriend, the loan shark and local thug, Qiao San (Li Zhubin). For much of the early parts of the film, the three characters seem to follow an aimless lifestyle. Unemployed, Bin Bin meets with his girlfriend to watch television on most days, while Xiao Ji seems to do nothing at all aside from flirt with Qiao Qiao. When an explosion rocks part of the city's textile mill, the characters are briefly pushed into action. Qiao Qiao, desperate to get her injured father into the hospital, has Xiao Ji rush to the bank in order to withdraw ¥2000 for the entry fee. As thanks, she takes Xiao Ji and Bin Bin first to lunch, where Xiao Ji references watching Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, and then to a discotheque. While dancing, Xiao Ji is led away by Qiao San's men, who humiliate and beat him. Enraged, Xiao Ji tries to avenge himself but is stopped by Bin Bin, who tells him that Qiao San keeps a gun on his person. Undeterred, Xiao Ji continues to pursue Qiao Qiao, who is eventually abandoned by her boyfriend. When the two young people end up in a hotel room, Qiao Qiao tries to explain to Xiao Ji the philosophy of Zhuangzi who, in his poem Ren Xiao Yao, \"philosophized that we should do what feels good.\" Soon afterward, it is learned that Qiao San has died in a car accident. The film implies that Qiao Qiao nevertheless leaves Xiao Ji and is last seen wearing a blue wig as a prostitute in a run-down club. Bin Bin, meanwhile, following the advice of his mother, tries to join the PLA, but is rejected when it is discovered that he suffers from hepatitis. Shattered, he borrows ¥1500 from a small-time crook Xiao Wu (Wang Hongwei). Bin Bin uses the money to purchase a cell phone for his girlfriend, but when she tries to get close to him, he refuses, and notes only that there is no future for him anymore. Bin Bin and Xiao Ji decide to rob a bank, as they have seen so often in American films. Attaching a fake bomb to Bin Bin's chest, Xiao Ji drives Bin Bin to a China Construction Bank, where the latter is immediately arrested. Fleeing, Xiao Ji drives his motorbike down the highway until it breaks down and he hitches a ride to locations unknown. Bin Bin is left at the police station, where an officer informs him that robbery is a capital crime. The film ends as the police officer forces Bin Bin to stand and sing. Bin Bin chooses to sing Ren Xiao Yao, a pop song about being spiritually free through love.",

Nogreh is one of the few girls at the school who dreams of one day becoming president. While searching for water one day after school she comes across several truckloads of refugees returning from Pakistan and helps them resettle in the ruins she calls home. However, the number of refugees overwhelms the shelter where her family have been living and they are eventually forced out by several other families. They manage to find shelter in an abandoned airplane but this, too, is eventually overcrowded by the returning refugees. Nogreh meets a refugee among the ruins who is a poet. She asks him if he knows whether the president of Pakistan is a man or a woman and he, like everyone else, does not know. However, after befriending Nogreh and learning of her ambitions to be president, he helps procure political speeches and goes with her to a photographer to get photos of her that she can use to campaign. Nogreh's father learns from one of the refugees that his son has died. Unwilling to tell his daughter-in-law, he moves the family further into the desert where his grandson dies of starvation and malnourishment.

    "film_title": "Carandiru (film)",
    "Synopsis": "This episodic story is set in São Paulo's notorious prison Carandiru, one of Latin America's largest and most violent prison systems. Carandiru tells the stories of different inmates at Sāo Paulo's Carandiru Penitentiary through the filter of Dr. Varella, who goes to the prison to test the inmates for HIV. Similar to many Brazilian crime films, Dr. Varella narrates Carandiru, however, it is not his story that is told. He (like Buscapé in City of God) acts as a filter for the stories of those that cannot speak. The inhumane conditions of the prison, such as the 100 square foot cells inhabited by sometimes up to 16 prisoners, are shown, as well as the lack of control that the guards have. Order in the prison is entirely controlled by the prisoners themselves, which leads them to face problems such as murders, rampant drug use, and disease all within the prison. Several stories are developed, ranging from drug addiction to murder to family struggles to romance. Some of the more memorable stories are Lady Di (a trans woman) and No Way's marriage, Deusdete and Zico's family dynamic, Ezequiel and Zico's crack addictions, and Majestade's \"affairs.\" The prisoners are humanized to the audience by telling their stories, which makes the riot and the Carandiru Massacre even more painful for the audience to watch. Thus, when the film ends with real shots of Carandiru Penitentiary's demolition, Babenco employs catharsis.",

    "film_title": "Dogville",
    "Synopsis": "Prologue: \"Which introduces us to the town and its residents\": Set in the isolated Rocky Mountain town of Dogville, near an abandoned silver mine, the film opens with a narrator introducing its 15 residents. Through the perspective of Tom Edison Jr. (Paul Bettany), an idealistic philosopher who organizes meetings on \"moral rearmament,\" the townsfolk are depicted as quaint but flawed. Tom aspires to replace his physician father as the community's moral leader. Chapter 1: \"In which Tom hears gunfire and meets Grace\": Tom encounters Grace Mulligan (Nicole Kidman), a fugitive fleeing gangsters. After hiding her in the mine, he convinces her to stay, arguing the mountains are impassable. When gangsters arrive searching for Grace, Tom lies about her whereabouts but accepts a reward card. At a town meeting, Tom proposes sheltering Grace as a test of their morality. The skeptical residents agree to a two-week trial, during which Grace must earn their trust. Chapter 2: \"In which Grace embarks upon physical labor\": Grace begins chores for the townspeople: comforting blind recluse Jack McKay, babysitting for Chuck and Vera, and assisting shopkeeper Ma Ginger. Her willingness to help softens initial reluctance, and she gradually integrates into Dogville. Chapter 3: \"In which Grace indulges in a shady provocation\": Grace bonds with Jack, who pretends to see. She tricks him into admitting his blindness, earning his respect. After the trial period, the town votes unanimously to let her stay. Chapter 4: \"Happy times in Dogville\": Grace continues her work, saving wages to buy porcelain Hummel figurines from Ma Ginger. Tensions rise when police post a \"Missing\" notice with Grace's name. Though divided on cooperating, the town opts to protect her—for now. Chapter 5: \"Fourth of July after all\": During Fourth of July celebrations, Tom confesses his love for Grace, reciprocated warmly. The mood sours when police replace the notice with a \"Wanted\" poster, accusing Grace of bank robbery. The town insists she's innocent but demands more labor as a . Reluctantly, Grace agrees. Chapter 6: \"In which Dogville bares its teeth\": Grace's expanded workload strains relations. Mistakes invite scorn: men sexually harass her, women grow abusive, and Vera's son Jason manipulates Grace into spanking him. The abuse culminates in Chuck raping Grace in his orchard. Chapter 7: \"In which Grace leaves Dogville and sees daylight\": Grace confides in Tom, who plans her escape. Vera retaliates for the spanking, while Martha exposes Chuck's assault. Vera smashes Grace's figurines, mocking her Stoic teachings. Tom arranges for trucker Ben to smuggle Grace out, but Ben rapes her and returns her to Dogville. Blamed for Tom's theft of his father's money, Grace is enslaved—chained, raped, and tormented by the town, including the children, who mock her suffering by ringing the church bells every time she is raped. Chapter 8: \"In which a meeting reveals the truth\": At a town meeting, Grace details her abuse, prompting residents to vote to hand her to the gangsters. Tom, feigning loyalty, attempts to sleep with her but is rebuffed. Realizing his hypocrisy, he betrays Grace by retrieving the reward card and calling her pursuers. Resigned, Grace mutters, \"Nobody's gonna sleep here\"—echoing Pirate Jenny's vengeance anthem. Chapter 9: \"In which Dogville receives its awaited visit\": The gangsters arrive, led by Grace's father. Revealed as a mob boss's daughter, Grace initially resists his harsh worldview but, after introspection, condemns Dogville. She orders the town's annihilation: Vera must watch her children die unless she stifles tears, echoing her own torment. Dogville is razed, its residents massacred. Tom, applauding Grace's \"illustration,\" is executed by her. Only the dog Moses—whose bone Grace once took—is spared. The credits roll over Jacob Holdt's stark photos of American poverty, set to \"Young Americans\" by David Bowie.",

    "Synopsis": "An ordinary day at a high school in Portland, Oregon, is shown through the perspective of several students. Among them are John, who struggles with dealing with his alcoholic father; Elias, a photography student who is building a portfolio of other students; Michelle, an outcast who struggles with her body issues; Nicole, Brittany, and Jordan, three bulimic teens who gripe about their parents; popular athlete and lifeguard Nathan and his girlfriend, Carrie; and Acadia, a close friend of John's who attends a gay–straight alliance meeting. Unbeknownst to anyone, two other students, Alex and Eric, are preparing to carry out a mass shooting and bomb attack at their school. Their motives are vague and inconclusive, with several scenes showing them being bullied and exposed to violent media. Flashbacks throughout the film show them preparing for the massacre by ordering weapons online and formulating an attack plan, which is to detonate bombs in the cafeteria during lunch hour and shoot people as they try to escape. On the day of the shooting, the pair makes their way to school in Alex's car, armed with a rifle, a shotgun, and several pistols. John encounters them outside the school and is told by Alex to leave. Realizing what is about to happen, John tries to warn students and teachers outside, then goes looking for his father after finding his car still outside the school from when they arrived earlier that morning. Inside the school, the bombs that Alex and Eric had planted fail to go off, so they decide to start shooting indiscriminately. The pair heads to the library and opens fire on the students there, killing Elias (who photographed them right before they started shooting) and Michelle. Other students and teachers in the building hear the gunfire and begin to evacuate. The gunmen then split up and head to opposite ends of the school. Alex enters the girls' bathroom where he surprises Nicole, Brittany, and Jordan, presumably shooting all three. Acadia becomes frozen in fear after witnessing a student being shot dead in the corridor before she is rescued by Benny, a student athlete who helps her out a window before deciding to find the gunmen. Outside the school, John finds his now-sober father, who tries to comfort him as they observe the ongoing attack. In the corridor, Eric encounters Mr. Luce, the principal, whom he chastises for treating kids like him and Alex poorly. Benny encounters the two and is shot dead, before Eric seemingly lets Mr. Luce go, only to kill him moments later. Alex and Eric reunite in the cafeteria, now strewn with overturned chairs, backpacks, several dead bodies, and numerous abandoned half-eaten lunches. The pair have a brief conversation about who they've shot while Alex casually drinks from a cup, which ends when he suddenly shoots Eric mid-sentence. Alex leaves the cafeteria, showing no emotion over killing Eric, and discovers Carrie and Nathan hiding in a freezer. He tauntingly recites \"Eeny, meeny, miny, moe\" to them to decide whom he should kill first, though the film ends before he makes his decision.",

    "film_title": "Father and Son (2003 film)",
    "Synopsis": "A father (Father) and his son Aleksei share a rooftop apartment in an unidentified seaside city. The Father is a former combat helicopter pilot, and Aleksei attends military school where he is studying to become a sports trainer. Given Father's youthfulness, he and Aleksei seem to understand each other, yet their life experiences separate them, and over the course of the film a rift gradually develops between them, that rift and Aleksei's reaction to it becoming the source of his subsequent nightmares. Regarded by some as \"plotless,\" like many Sokurov films, Father and Son combines two narrative structures, one circular, the other linear. The film opens and closes with scenes from the circular structure, in which Father comforts Aleksei, who has just had one of his nightmare; the film concludes when Father retires to the rooftop to await Aleksei's next cry for help. The mise-en-scene of the framing scenes (e.g., Father's sitting down in the snow in his pajamas) together with intertextual references to famous painterly depictions of angels Sokurov quotes (e.g., Rembrandt's Jacob Wrestling with the Angel) identify Father as Aleksei's guardian angel, who returns from death (the result of his combat wounds) to protect and comfort his son. Father's status as Aleksei's guardian angel explains the physical closeness displayed by the two men, which has been interpreted by some as sexual intimacy. The film's linear narrative, enclosed within the circular frame, collapses into a weekend events that have occurred over time, but which Aleksei has linked together in his nightmare into a single series of events, through which he relives Father's unlimited love for him and his own failure to understand and/or appreciate that love. During those two days Aleksei and Father encounter two young men Aleksei's age––Sasha and Fyodor, both of whom are fatherless for different reasons, their fathers' absences evoking the sons' emotional and even mental distress. During those same two days Aleksei's unnamed girlfriend breaks up their relationships, Aleksei's unwillingness to assume fatherhood a point of contention between them. Father and Son comprises an allegory of fatherly love and filial regret, a variation on one of Sokurov's recurring themes, the 'Parable of the Prodigal Son'.",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 to 700 words. --> In 1975,<!--Do not change 1975 to 1977, even though the 25 years do not add up to 2002. The film's credits indicate a character as being a \"'75 Reporter\"--> Irish-American neighborhood friends Jimmy Markum, Sean Devine, and Dave Boyle are playing street hockey in Charlestown, Boston. After the boys write their names in a patch of wet concrete on the sidewalk, two predators posing as police officers abduct Dave and rape him for four days until he escapes. One of the kidnappers dies before they can be caught, and the other is arrested and later dies by suicide in prison. 25 years later, Jimmy is an ex-convict and neighborhood convenience store owner; Sean is a detective with the Massachusetts State Police whose pregnant wife Lauren recently left him, and Dave is a blue-collar worker continually haunted by the abduction and rape he suffered. Jimmy and Dave are connected by marriage: Dave's wife Celeste and Jimmy's second wife Annabeth are cousins. Jimmy's daughter from his first marriage, Katie, plans to run away to Las Vegas with Brendan Harris, a boy from a family Jimmy despises that she has been secretly dating. One night, Dave sees Katie and her friends at a local bar. That same night, she is murdered, and Dave comes home bloodied and injured, claiming he fought off a mugger and possibly killed him. Sean and his partner Whitey Powers investigate the murder while Jimmy, distraught at Katie's death, conducts a separate investigation using his neighborhood connections. A witness statement suggests that Katie may have known her killer. The detectives learn that the gun used to kill her, a .38 Special revolver, was also used in a liquor store robbery in 1984 by \"Just Ray\" Harris, Brendan's father. Harris has been missing since 1989, but Brendan claims he still sends his family $500 monthly and feigns ignorance about Ray's gun. Whitey suspects Dave, who keeps changing the story about how his hand got injured. Dave continues to behave erratically, which upsets Celeste to the point that she leaves their home and tells Jimmy she suspects Dave is Katie's murderer. Jimmy and his friends invite Dave to a local bar, get him drunk and confront him when he is about to vomit. Jimmy admits to Dave that he killed \"Just Ray\" for implicating him in the liquor store robbery, which resulted in his imprisonment. Dave reveals to Jimmy that he did kill someone that night, but it wasn't Katie; he beat to death a child molester whom he found with a child who was being sex-trafficked. Jimmy, not believing him and after forcing him to admit to Katie's murder, kills him and disposes of his body in the adjacent Mystic River. Meanwhile, after finding his father's gun missing, Brendan confronts his mute younger brother \"Silent Ray\" and his friend John O'Shea about Katie's murder. He beats the two boys, before John pulls out Ray's gun and is about to shoot Brendan. Sean and Whitey, having connected the teens to the murder, arrive in time to disarm and arrest John and Ray. The next morning, Sean tells Jimmy that John and Silent Ray confessed to killing Katie as part of a prank gone wrong. Sean asks Jimmy if he has seen Dave, who is wanted for questioning in the murder of a known child molester. Jimmy does not answer, instead thanking Sean for finding Katie's killers. Sean reunites with Lauren after apologizing for pushing her away, while Jimmy confesses what he's done to Annabeth. During a local parade, Sean sees Jimmy and points a finger gun at him, but Jimmy shrugs it off.",

    "Synopsis": "In June 1940, as German troops are advancing on Paris, Odile, an attractive widow in her late thirties, joins the exodus from the city with her two children: 13-year-old Philippe and 7-year-old Cathy. Like many others, they are heading south in a long line of refugees escaping Paris by whatever means of transport possible. After fifty kilometers, German planes bomb the choked road filled with civilians. Odile's car is destroyed and in the chaos, she runs from the roadside fields into the nearby woods, looking for shelter. They are helped by a shaven-headed wiry teenager, Yvan, who recommends that they continue off-road. Resourceful and fiercely independent, Yvan, who is seventeen, can hunt and knows his way around the forest, so he can be of big help to Odile and her children. Odile regards this enigmatic scamp with overt suspicion, but Yvan charms Cathy and especially Philippe, who admires his rogue self-sufficiency and take-charge attitude. Afraid that Yvan will leave them, Philippe bribes him to stay, using his late father's watch as an inducement. After a night in the open, the four fugitives stumble upon a large house. Yvan unhesitatingly breaks in. Odile just would like to make a phone call, but Yvan convinces them all that the abandoned house is a safe and comfortable refuge from the war, at least temporarily. As he goes inside, Yvan cuts the phone lines and hides an existing radio, before opening the door to the others, ensuring their isolation from what is happening in the outside world.. An almost idyllic peaceful life follows for the four refugees, away from the war around them. The house is large and comfortable and as Odile soon discovers it was a country retreat owned by a Jewish married couple of musicians who left for abroad. Odile takes on house chores providing a sense of normalcy for her children. Her husband was killed recently fighting the Germans and she, a former school teacher, was ill prepared by the subsequent upheavals created by the war. With time, Odile's suspicions about the young stranger begin to fade away, as Yvan makes himself indispensable providing food. Knowing the countryside and its dangers well, he hunts rabbits and catches fish from a nearby river during the day; at night he makes excursions to retrieve objects from dead soldiers and provisions from abandoned homes. Cathy enjoys his company and Philippe admires him as an ideal older brother, but when Yvan finds a gun and grenade, Odile hides it from him. Philippe refuses to tell Yvan where it is and they quarrel. Realizing that Yvan is illiterate, Odile begins to teach him how to read and write. She begins to open up to him, but Yvan does not give much information about his past only that he was orphaned and it is evident that he was in a reformatory. As he lays aside his brash attitude, he confesses to her that he loves her and wishes to become her husband. She is surprised and bemused, but flattered. Days later, two French soldiers named Georges and Robert arrive leaving the war. There has been an armistice. Odile provides the soldiers with food and shelter but Yvan, who hides from them, does not trust them. Certain that they want to rape Odile, he intends to kill them, but ends up hitting Philippe when he tries to stop him. Yvan decides to stay away. At night Odile walks out of the house where the soldiers sleep to find Yvan. They make love passionately, since he does not know any other way, they have anal sex. As he is hungry, Yvan leaves to find something to eat. He promises to come back the next day and celebrate the soldier’s departure. The next morning policemen arrive at the house, having caught Yvan stealing. The clothing Yvan was wearing led the police to the abandoned house. Yvan and Odile remain silent, but Philippe confesses that they know him, he is their friend. Odile then tells the police how the young man helped them. Sometime later Odile and her children are seen with many others in a camp for refugees. The policeman approaches Odile in private. He wants to see if she has more information about Yvan, but she lies and tells him that he never even mentioned his name. The policeman bluntly informs her that her friend committed suicide by hanging the night before. Yvan's real name was Jean Delmas, a fugitive from a reformatory in Mettray. When Philippe asks his mother about Yvan, Odile lies and says that he escaped.",

    "Synopsis": "Sarah Morton, a middle-aged English mystery author based in London, who has written a successful series of detective novels, is experiencing writer's block that is impeding her next book. Her publisher, John Bosload, offers her his country house near Lacoste, France, for some rest and relaxation. Sarah takes him up on the offer, hinting that she hopes John may visit. After settling into the spacious, sun-filled house and meeting the groundskeeper, Marcel, Sarah finds her quietude disrupted by a young woman claiming to be John's daughter, Julie. She arrives late one night explaining that she is taking time off from work herself. She eventually tells Sarah that her mother used to be John's mistress, but that he would not leave his family. Julie's sex life consists of one-night stands with various men, and a competition of personalities develops between the two women. At first, Sarah regards Julie as a distraction from her writing. She uses earplugs to sleep during Julie's noisy sexual encounters, but develops a voyeuristic fascination with them, abandoning the earplugs during one of Julie's trysts. Sarah sneaks into Julie's room and steals her diary, using it in the novel she is working on. The competition comes to the fore when a local waiter, Franck, is involved. Julie is attracted to him, but he appears to prefer the more mature Sarah, having struck up a relationship with her during her frequent lunches at the bistro. An unexpected tragedy occurs after a night of flirting among the three. After swimming together in the pool, Franck refuses to allow Julie to continue performing oral sex on him once Sarah, who is watching them from the balcony, throws a rock into the water. Franck tells Julie he is leaving. The next day, Franck is missing. While investigating Franck's disappearance, Sarah is told that Julie's mother died years earlier, though Julie had spoken of her mother as if she were alive. She returns to the villa, where a confused Julie thinks Sarah is her mother and has a breakdown. Julie eventually recovers and confesses that Franck is dead after she repeatedly hit him over the head with a rock as he tried to leave her at the pool. His body is in one of the sheds. When Marcel becomes suspicious of the mound of fresh soil where Sarah and Julie have buried Franck's body, Sarah seduces him to distract him. Julie leaves, thanking Sarah for her help and leaving her the manuscript of an unpublished novel she claims her mother wrote, which she had previously said John made her mother burn. Sarah uses the mother's manuscript in her novel. Sarah returns to London and visits John at his publishing office with her new novel, titled Swimming Pool, which she anticipated he would reject, so she had it printed by another publisher. His daughter, Julia, arrives just as Sarah is leaving, but is revealed to be a different person than the girl who came to John's house in France.",

    "Synopsis": "Livia, a young but mentally unaware woman, lives on an expansive state with a significant wealth. It is revealed through her somewhat childish behavior that she suffers from delusional visions, ones that she writes in her notebooks and shares with strangers. Her father and surrounding family members, seeing an opportunity to accumulate her inheritance, seek out a solution to have her die in order for others to receive the wealth she holds. They find a mental patient named Pointpoirot, whose sociopathic demeanor and violent tendencies lead to Harald choosing him for the job. Pointpoirot is released from the institution, given instructions to kill Livia. At Livia's estate, she encounters Pointpoirot as he wanders outside, finding herself oddly curious with his behavior (such as his mirrorless switchblade shaving). She allows him in, charmed by his politeness and seemingly innocent behavior, until he snaps and attempts to attack her. In retaliation, Livia knocks out Pointpoirot with a hammer, then accidentally killing one of her unsuspecting relatives with the same weapon. Following this, Livia finds herself wandering around the estate, seemingly oblivious to the crime she had committed. Pointpoirot, once awakened, finds himself intrigued by Livia's behavior, begins to aid her, murdering family members one by one as they appear at the estate. Forming an affectionate bond, Pointpoirot and Livia share time together, singing and playing piano as well as conversing. Meanwhile, the inspector and police officer assigned to the case appear to do nothing, instead allowing the conspiracy to unfold as it will. As family members progressively continue to die, it becomes clear that Livia is unaware of the fact that they are actually dead, going so far as to set up her relatives' bodies for supper. Livia and Pointpoirot continue to fall in love, whilst Harald continues to investigate the disappearances of the family. Upon realizing what is coming, Pointpoirot escapes, declaring his love for Livia as he makes his getaway. Harald arrives at her home, horrified by the carnage that had ensued. An investigator looking into the murderers discovers the motivations of the family to inherit the fortune. Harald, although tempted to end the madness by killing Livia, finds himself trapped, and with few options, commits suicide. As the film ends, we see schoolchildren walking in a line to class as military trucks drive by in a caravan. Over a disembodied radio, we hear a voice describing the massacre at the estate.",

    "Synopsis": "Seventeen years after the events of The Decline of the American Empire, Sébastien is enjoying a successful career in quantitative finance in London when he receives a call from his mother, Louise, that his father and Louise's ex-husband Rémy is terminally ill with cancer. Sébastien is not enthused about seeing Rémy, whom he blames for breaking up the family with his many adulteries. Rémy and his friends of the older generation are still largely social-democrats and proponents of Quebec nationalism, positions seeming somewhat anachronistic long after the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s. Rémy does not like Sébastien's career, lack of reading and fondness for video games. The father and son travel to the U.S. state of Vermont to briefly receive medical care before returning to the overcrowded and disorganized Quebec hospital. Sébastien attempts to bribe hospital administration for better care, and calls Rémy's old friends about a possible visit. Upon hearing heroin is \"800%\" more effective than morphine, he tracks some down for Rémy from a drug addict, Nathalie. Meanwhile, Rémy is reunited with his friends, including Pierre, Dominique, Claude and Diane, Nathalie's mother, and they share a conversation on their old sex drive and the gradual decline of their vitality. Diane is concerned for Nathalie, while Rémy, a history professor, lectures the hospital chaplain Constance on the relative peace of the 20th century compared to past centuries. At the same time, another scholar describes the September 11 attacks as historically small except as a possible beginning of modern barbarian invasions. After Rémy and his friends retreat to the countryside, they speak of their devotion to constantly evolving -isms. Rémy dies in the company of his friends and Sébastien, after a heroin injection from Nathalie, whom Rémy calls his guardian angel.",

    "Synopsis": "Motorcycle racer Bud Clay undertakes a cross-country drive, following a race in New Hampshire, in order to participate in a race in California. All the while he is haunted by memories of his former lover, Daisy. On his journey he meets three women, but Bud seems to be a lost soul, and he is unable to form an emotional connection with any of them. He first meets Violet at a gas station in New Hampshire and persuades her to join him on his trip. They stop at her home in order to get her clothes, but he drives off as soon as she enters the house. Bud's next stop is the home of Daisy's parents, the location of Daisy's brown bunny. Daisy's mother does not remember Bud, who grew up in the house next door, nor does she remember having visited Bud and Daisy in California. Next, Bud stops at a pet shelter, where he asks about the life expectancy of rabbits (he is told it is about five or six years). At a highway rest stop, he meets a distressed woman, Lilly. He comforts and kisses her, before starting to cry and eventually leaving her. Bud appears more distressed as the road trip continues, crying as he drives. He stops at the Bonneville Speedway to race his motorcycle. In Las Vegas, he drives around prostitutes on street corners, before deciding to ask one of them, Rose, to join him for a lunch. She eats McDonald's food in his truck until he stops, pays her, and leaves her back on the street. After having his motorcycle checked in a Los Angeles garage, Bud stops at Daisy's house, which appears abandoned. He leaves a note on the door frame, after sitting in his truck in the driveway remembering about kissing Daisy in this place and checks in at a hotel. Daisy eventually appears there. She seems nervous, going to the bathroom twice to smoke crack cocaine, while Bud waits for her, sitting on his bed. As she proposes to go out to buy something to drink, Bud tells her that, because of what happened the last time they saw each other, he does not drink anymore. They have an argument about Daisy kissing other men. At this point, Bud undresses Daisy and she fellates him. Once done, he insults her as they lie in bed, talking about what happened during their last meeting. Bud continuously asks Daisy why she had been involved with some men at a party. She explains that she was just being friendly and wanted to smoke marijuana with them. Bud becomes upset because Daisy was pregnant, and it transpires that the baby died as a result of what happened at this party. Through flashback scenes, the viewer understands that Daisy was raped at the party, a scene witnessed by Bud, who did not intervene. Daisy asks Bud why he did not help her, and his feelings of guilt about this are considerable. He tells her that he did not know what to do, and so he decided to leave the party. After he came back a bit later, he saw an ambulance in front of the house and Daisy explains to Bud that she is dead, having passed out prior to the rape and then choked to death on her own vomit. Bud awakens the next morning, alone; his encounter with Daisy turns out to have been a figment of his imagination. The movie ends as Bud is driving his truck in California, alone again and still not with what he needs.",

    "Synopsis": "Yusuf, a young factory worker who recently lost his job, travels to Istanbul to stay with Mahmut, one of his relatives, while looking for a job. Mahmut is a rather wealthy and intellectual photographer, whereas Yusuf is almost illiterate, uneducated, and unsophisticated. The two do not get along well. Yusuf assumes that he will easily find work as a sailor but there are no jobs, and he has no sense of direction or energy. Meanwhile, Mahmut, despite his wealth, is aimless too: his job, which consists of photographing tiles, is dull and inartistic; he can barely express emotions towards his ex-wife or his lover. When Yusuf goes to bed during a film, Mahmut switches channels to watch porn the moment he's gone. Mahmut attempts to bond with Yusuf and recapture his love of art by taking him on a drive to photograph the beautiful Turkish countryside, but the attempt is a failure on both counts. At the end of the film, Yusuf leaves without telling Mahmut, who is left to sit by the docks, watching the ships on his own.",

    "Synopsis": "There are four main story arcs, listed in approximate order below. In typical Wong fashion, they are presented in non-chronological order. Knowledge of Days of Being Wild and In the Mood for Love is assumed, but not necessary to understand 2046. Returning to Hong Kong after years in Singapore, Chow has become a suave ladies' man to cover up his pain from losing Su. Chow meets Lulu, taking her home but accidentally keeps her room key. Upon returning the key, Chow later learns that Lulu was stabbed the night before by a jealous boyfriend. The landlord's daughter Jing-wen is seeing a man her father strongly disapproves of. Eventually, Jing-wen breaks up with him. The next tenant is Jing-wen's younger sister Jie-wen who attempts and fails to seduce Chow. Soon after, Chow runs into financial difficulties so he starts writing a series. Bai Ling is a nightclub ballroom dancer seeking a long-term relationship. Bai runs into Chow after her boyfriend leaves her before a planned trip to Singapore and they become friends. The relationship quickly turns sexual. Chow wants to keep the relationship purely physical, continuing to see other women; when Bai realizes she has feelings for Chow and asks for exclusivity, Chow refuses and they break up. Bai then returns to prostitution. After Bai leaves, Jing-wen is released from institutional care and still depressed over her previous relationship. Chow develops feelings for Jing-wen and attempts a relationship but nothing develops as she is still in love with her previous lover. Jing-wen gets engaged. Depressed over the loss of Jing-wen, Chow runs into Bai Ling and believes she is likely to remain content with her misery. He resolves to get over Su. Some time later, Bai calls Chow and they go out to dinner. She informs Chow of her plans to leave for Singapore, asking for a reference. Chow met Su after arriving in Singapore, financially spent. Su agrees to help him win money so he can return to Hong Kong and they become lovers. When he asks Su to return to Hong Kong with him, Su challenges him to a final draw that Chow loses, and so she refuses to go with him and also refuses to tell him why. When Chow returns to Singapore to visit her a second time, he does not find her and hears rumors that Su either returned to Cambodia or was killed. The night before Bai leaves for Singapore, Chow dines with her again. She insists on paying for dinner and hands him a stack of cash, each $10 bill representing a night they spent together. After dinner, Chow walks her back to her apartment and Bai begs him to spend the night. He cannot, and leaves by taxi.",

    "Synopsis": "Emily Wang (Maggie Cheung), a former video jockey, who has been in a tempestuous relationship for several years with Lee Hauser (played by James Johnston of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds), a rock musician. Lee's friends feel that Emily is bad for him, describing her as a junkie. Their young son, Jay, is living in Vancouver with Lee's parents. As the film opens, the pair have arrived in Hamilton, Canada, to see Metric perform. Following an argument in their motel room, Emily walks out and, after taking heroin, falls asleep in her car. When she returns the following morning, she finds that Lee has died of a drug overdose, and the Ontario Provincial Police are investigating. As Emily attempts to force her way into the room, the police find heroin in her bag and she is arrested. Emily spends six months in jail and, upon release, discovers that custody of her son has been awarded to Lee's parents. She resolves to return to Paris, where she used to live. Before leaving, she briefly meets Albrecht, Lee's father (played by Nick Nolte), who tells her that he would prefer that she not see Jay for a few years. In Paris, Emily begins work in a Chinese restaurant owned by relatives but does not enjoy it. She has become addicted to methadone and relies on her friends for prescriptions. Meanwhile, Lee's mother, Rosemary (played by Martha Henry) falls ill and she and Albrecht travel to London with Jay for medical treatment. While they are there, Albrecht decides to take Jay to meet Emily, but the boy has been told by his grandmother that Emily was responsible for his father's death and does not want to see her. Emily eventually decides that she must get clean in order to be able to spend time with her son. She stops taking methadone and prepares for Jay's arrival. When the boy eventually meets her, she takes him to a zoo and explains her relationship with his father and why they took drugs. Emily also has become a singer; when she is given the opportunity arising from meeting a fellow musician in prison, she must make some serious decisions about her life.",

    "Unnamed: 0": 1380,

    "film_title": "Fahrenheit 9/11",
    "Synopsis": "The documentary begins by suggesting that friends and political allies of George W. Bush at Fox News Channel tilted the election of 2000 by prematurely declaring Bush the winner. It then suggests that the handling of the voting controversy in Florida constituted election fraud. The documentary then segues into the September 11 attacks of 2001. Moore says that Bush was informed of the first plane hitting the World Trade Center on his way to an elementary school in Florida. Bush is then shown sitting in an Emma E. Booker Elementary School classroom with children. When told that a second plane has crashed into the World Trade Center and that the nation is \"under attack\", Bush allows the students to finish their book-reading, and Moore notes that he continued reading The Pet Goat for nearly seven minutes. Moore then discusses the tangled relationships among the U.S. government and the Bush family, the bin Laden family, the Saudi Arabian government, and the Taliban, which span over three decades. Moore then states that the United States Government had evacuated 24 members of the bin Laden family on a secret flight shortly after the attacks, without subjecting them to any form of interrogation. Moore moves on to examine George W. Bush's Texas Air National Guard service record. Moore contends that Bush's dry-hole-oil-well attempts were partially funded by the Saudis and by the bin Laden family through the intermediation of James R. Bath, whose name is shown to have been blacked out from Bush's records. Moore alleges that these conflicts of interest suggest that the Bush administration does not serve in the interests of Americans. The movie continues by suggesting ulterior motives for the War in Afghanistan, including a natural gas pipeline through Afghanistan to the Indian Ocean. Moore suggests that the Bush administration induced a climate of fear among the American population through the mass media. Moore then describes purported anti-terror efforts, including government infiltration of pacifist groups and other events, and the signing of the USA PATRIOT Act. The documentary then turns to the subject of the Iraq War, comparing the lives of Iraqis before and after the invasion. The citizens of Iraq are portrayed as living relatively happy lives prior to the country's invasion by the U.S. Armed Forces. The film also takes pains to depict war cheerleading in the U.S. media and the general bias of journalists, with quotes from news organizations and embedded journalists. Moore suggests that atrocities will occur in Iraq and shows footage depicting U.S. abuse of prisoners. Later in the film, Lila Lipscomb appears with her family after hearing of the death of her son, Sgt. Michael Pedersen, who was killed on April 2, 2003, in Karbala. Anguished and tearful, she questions the purpose of the war. Tying together several themes and points, Moore thanks those serving in the U.S. military. He claims that the working class of America are always the first to join the Army, while people of higher class display less such readiness. He states that those valuable citizens should not be sent to risk their lives unless it is truly necessary to defend America. The credits roll while Neil Young's \"Rockin' in the Free World\" plays. (Moore had originally intended to use The Who's \"Won't Get Fooled Again\" but was denied permission by Pete Townshend). Moore dedicated the film to his friend who died in the World Trade Center attacks and to those servicemen and women from Flint, Michigan, who died in Iraq: \"Michael Pedersen, Brett Petriken, and all the men and women from the Flint Area who have died in the Iraq War ... Bill Weems and the 2,973 who died on 9/11/01 ... and the countless thousands who have died in Afghanistan and Iraq as a result of our actions.\"",

    "Synopsis": "The film opens just as construction has been completed on a railway connecting mountainous regions of eastern Bosnia and western Serbia in 1992. Luka, a Serbian engineer, has moved to Bosnia from Belgrade with his mentally unstable wife, Jadranka, and his football-playing son, Miloš, to run a railway station and act as caretaker. Luka is at work preparing the opening of the railway while Miloš attempts to become a professional footballer with the Partizan team. Utterly engrossed in his work and blinded by natural optimism, Luka remains deaf to the increasingly persistent rumblings of war, which has broken out in Croatia and threatens to spread. When the conflict explodes, Miloš is denied his place on the football field when he is enlisted into the Serbian army, and Jadranka disappears on the arm of a Hungarian musician. Eventually, Luka receives news that Miloš has been taken prisoner of war. Luka considers suicide, but a profiteering acquaintance presents him with Sabaha, a Bosnian Muslim whom he has taken hostage. Luka intends to exchange Sabaha for Miloš, but the two fall in love after they are forced to flee deeper into Serb-controlled territory. When a UN-enforced prisoner exchange is finally arranged, Luka and Sabaha try to escape to Serbia at an attempt to cross the Drina river, but Sabaha is wounded by a Bosnian sniper after squatting to urinate behind a tree. Army nurses narrowly manage to save Sabaha's life, and she is exchanged for Miloš, along with other prisoners. Jadranka also returns, and the family is reunited in their old home, but Luka is lovesick. He lies down in front of a train, but when the train stops to avoid running over a mule, it is revealed that Sabaha is on board, and the two ride away on the mule.",

    "Synopsis": "A young mother and her four children move into a small apartment in Tokyo. Only the eldest, Akira, is known to the landlord; he and his mother Keiko smuggle the youngest boy and girl, Shigeru and Yuki, into the apartment inside suitcases. The elder sister, Kyōko, comes separately by train. Each of the children has a different father. Their mother does not allow them to go to school or be seen by others, and only Akira is allowed to go outside. After a few months, Keiko tells Akira that she has a new boyfriend, and that after she gets married, the children can lead normal lives, but Akira seems doubtful. Without warning, Keiko leaves home and is away for months, leaving only a small amount of money for the children. Akira is forced to take charge of paying the rent and other expenses and caring for his younger siblings. When they run out of money, Akira goes to see several men who may be Yuki's biological father and asks them for money. At length, Keiko returns, bringing all the children gifts, but soon leaves again. Though she promises she will be back in time for Christmas, she breaks this promise, and the season changes to the New Year and then to spring without her returning, forcing Akira and Kyōko into the roles of surrogate parents. Akira soon finds evidence that she has already married and left them forever, though he does not tell his siblings. Again running out of money, they are unable to pay their rent any longer and subsist on inexpensive food from the convenience store. On Yuki's birthday, she asks to go outside to wait for their mother at the train station. The siblings enjoy a day out together, and though their mother does not return, Akira promises Yuki that one day he will take her on the Tokyo Monorail to see the airplanes take off at Haneda Airport. Akira befriends two boys his own age at a game arcade who start frequenting the family's apartment, playing games and roughhousing, and he begins to neglect his siblings. The apartment is falling into disrepair with no one cleaning or keeping up with other chores. When Akira and the two boys go to the convenience store one day, they dare him to shoplift. Akira refuses, and the two boys leave him. Several months later, when the two have entered junior high school, Akira comes by their school and invites them over to play, but they refuse, and Akira overhears them saying that his house smells like garbage. In an apologetic gesture, Akira takes his siblings to a nearby park to play and buys them candy and toys at the convenience store. They start a garden on the veranda of the apartment, planting seeds from wildflowers inside instant noodle cups. Eventually the electricity, gas, and water in the apartment are all turned off. The children start using the public park's toilet to wash themselves and the tap there for their water. On one of these visits, Shigeru starts a conversation with Saki, a high school student who is cutting class, which blossoms into a friendship between her and the siblings, and she begins to visit them and help Akira and Kyoko care for the family. However, when she tries to help Akira out of financial difficulties by offering him money obtained through enjo kōsai, Akira rejects it and runs away. With summer approaching, the children have little money and are growing weary. Akira goes out one day to watch a junior high school's baseball match. The team's coach spots him and, short a player, asks him to sub in. Akira joins the game and enjoys playing baseball. While he is away, Yuki falls from a stool while trying to reach for something and dies. Akira goes to find Saki again, finally accepting her offer of financial support, and they buy as many boxes as they can find of Yuki's favorite chocolate candies, which they place with Yuki's dead body in a suitcase. With Saki's help, Akira takes the suitcase to a field near Haneda Airport's runway. They sit and watch planes come in, and then he and Saki dig a grave and bury the suitcase. They then return to the apartment, and the film ends with Akira, Kyōko, Shigeru, and Saki still together, walking home. Saki now has her hair in pigtails, almost like the longer pigtails Yuki used to wear.",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. --> In 1988, businessman Oh Dae-su is arrested for assault and drunkenness, causing him to miss his daughter's fourth birthday. His friend Joo-hwan collects him, but Dae-su disappears and awakens in a sealed hotel room. Takeout food is delivered through a pet door, and his only diversion is a television; from it, Dae-su learns that he has been framed for his wife's murder. As years pass, Dae-su grows deranged from solitude and attempts suicide by wrist-cutting, but is resuscitated. Dae-su then begins practicing martial arts against the wall and attempting to dig an escape tunnel. Fifteen years later, Dae-su is sedated, hypnotised, and released. He awakens on a rooftop, where he saves a suicidal man and recounts his story; once finished, Dae-su allows the man to commit suicide. Dae-su receives money and a phone from a beggar, and enters a sushi restaurant. Taunted by his captor over the phone, Dae-su orders and consumes a live octopus before collapsing. He is taken in by the young sushi chef, Mi-do, who reads his journals. Dae-su searches for his daughter, but gives up after learning she was adopted and emigrated. Focusing on his captors, he eats at Chinese restaurants until he identifies which one prepared his prison meals. Chasing a deliveryman, Dae-su finds a private prison where people pay to have others incarcerated. He tortures and interrogates the warden, Mr. Park, who divulges that Dae-su was imprisoned for \"talking too much\". Park's guards attack Dae-su, but he fights his way through. Dae-su reconnects with Joo-hwan, who now works at an internet café. Dae-su becomes suspicious of Mi-do and binds her, but his captor calls and sends him to a neighboring apartment. Using the pseudonym \"Evergreen\", he gives Dae-su an ultimatum: if he can uncover his motive within five days, Evergreen will remotely deactivate his pacemaker; otherwise, Evergreen will kill Mi-do. Dae-su returns to Mi-do to find Park and his thugs molesting her. Park prepares to torture Dae-su, but stops when Evergreen sends a briefcase of cash; Dae-su threatens to remove Park's hand, but Park leaves. Mi-do is upset by the ultimatum, but she and Dae-su grow closer and have sex in a love hotel. Dae-su wakes to find Park's hand wrapped in a box; he investigates his possessions, and has his shoe debugged. Dae-su and Mi-do follow Evergreen's pseudonym to Dae-su's high-school motto: \"Evergreen Old Boys\". Identifying Evergreen as Lee Woo-jin in a yearbook, Dae-su calls Joo-hwan. Joo-hwan recalls a girl in his class, Lee Soo-ah — who is revealed to be Woo-jin's sister — and crassly describes her sex life and suicide; an eavesdropping Woo-jin angrily stabs Joo-hwan to death. Dae-su seeks out Park, who wants revenge for his hand removal; Park agrees to temporarily imprison Mi-do to keep her safe. Talking to Soo-ah's friends, Dae-su recalls witnessing her having sex with Woo-jin. Unaware it was incest, Dae-su had told Joo-hwan of her promiscuity, who then spread gossip. Woo-jin, in denial of the truth that he got his sister pregnant, claims Soo-ah developed a false pregnancy, which drove her to suicide. At Woo-jin's penthouse, Dae-su reveals Woo-jin's motive. An amused Woo-jin gifts Dae-su a family photo album, the contents revealing that Dae-su's daughter grew up into Mi-do. Woo-Jin's bodyguard fights Dae-Su, who stabs him in the ear and deafens him. Realising that his bodyguard will kill Dae-Su, he shoots him dead before continuing to monologue. Woo-jin reveals that he used hypnosis to orchestrate their meeting and incestuous relationship, and that he paid Park to imprison Mi-do. Woo-jin threatens to tell Mi-do the truth, and Dae-su desperately grovels; when Woo-jin is unmoved, Dae-su cuts out his tongue as penance. Woo-jin accepts his apology, instructing Park to not tell Mi-do and dropping his pacemaker remote. Dae-su uses it, but it only plays a recording of Dae-su and Mi-do having sex, making him collapse in despair. Woo-jin leaves the penthouse apparently satisfied with his work. However, he hallucinates his sister's suicide as he is in the elevator and breaks into a flood of tears. Realising that despite his vengeance he will always be tormented by his past, he pulls out his derringer, presses it to his head, and kills himself. Sometime later, Dae-su locates the hypnotist and requests she erase his knowledge of Mi-do being his daughter. Touched by a specific line in his letter, she guides Dae-su to envision the part of himself that knows the truth dying. A concerned Mi-do finds Dae-su lying alone in the snow. Mi-do confesses her love for him, and the two embrace; Dae-su smiles, but it becomes a tortured grimace.",

Shrek worries he is losing Fiona, especially after finding her childhood diary and reading that she was once seemingly infatuated with Prince Charming. Harold is secretly reprimanded by Fairy Godmother, who had arranged with Harold for her son—Charming—to be the one to rescue and marry Fiona; she hopes to use the marriage to rule Far Far Away through Charming. She orders Harold to get rid of Shrek or else lose his own happy ending, so Harold hires swashbuckling outlaw and mercenary Puss in Boots to assassinate Shrek. Unable to overpower Shrek, Puss reveals that he was paid by Harold and offers to help him in gratitude for having his own life spared. Shrek, Donkey, and Puss meet with Fairy Godmother at her potions factory to find something to help Shrek appeal to Fiona, but she coldly rejects his request, insisting ogres do not deserve happy endings. They retaliate by stealing a potion labeled \"Happily Ever After\" and accidentally trashing the factory. Shrek and Donkey drink the potion and soon fall asleep. Back in Far Far Away, Fiona notices Shrek is missing and tries to find him, but she too falls asleep. The next morning, Shrek and Fiona awaken to find they are now human, and Donkey is a white stallion. To make the change permanent, Shrek must kiss Fiona by midnight. Shrek, Donkey, and Puss return to the castle; however, Fairy Godmother, having discovered the theft, has sent Charming to pose as human Shrek and win Fiona's love. At Fairy Godmother's urging, Shrek leaves the castle, believing that the best way to make Fiona happy is to let her go. Fiona is skeptical of Charming; therefore, to ensure the two will wed, Fairy Godmother gives Harold a love potion to put into Fiona's tea. This exchange is overheard by Shrek, Donkey, and Puss, who are arrested by the royal knights after Donkey inadvertently exposes them. While the ball begins, the fairy tale creatures - having seen the arrest on the news - rescue the trio from the dungeon. They all storm the castle with the help of Mongo, a monstrous living gingerbread man created by the Muffin Man. Though Mongo is destroyed, the group manages to break into the ball. Shrek fails to prevent Charming from kissing Fiona, but instead of falling in love, Fiona knocks him out. Harold reveals that he swapped Fiona's tainted teacup with his own, refusing to go through with the plot. Livid, the Fairy Godmother tries to strike Shrek with a spell from her magic wand. Harold jumps in front of it and is struck; the rest of the spell reflects off his breastplate and hits the Fairy Godmother, causing her to disintegrate into bubbles. Harold reverts to his true form as the Frog Prince, having used the \"Happily Ever After\" potion years earlier to gain Lillian's love. He approves of Shrek and Fiona's marriage, while Lillian assures Harold that she still loves him. As the clock strikes midnight, Fiona declines Shrek's offer to remain human, and they revert to ogres, while Donkey also returns to normal, much to his sadness. Everyone celebrates as the ball continues. In a mid-credits scene, Dragon, who had recently married Donkey, arrives with several dragon-donkey hybrid babies.",

    "film_title": "The Consequences of Love",
    "Synopsis": "Titta Di Girolamo is a middle-aged loner who has spent the last eight years living in an upmarket hotel in Lugano, Switzerland. Every day he puts on his suit and wanders around, avoiding contact with people. In the morning, he solves the chess puzzles in the paper and in the evening he plays Grabber with a bankrupt aristocratic couple who are marooned in the hotel they used to own. Occasionally, he rings his family in Italy but his wife is always reluctant to talk, and his grown-up children despise him. He develops feelings for Sofia, the beautiful and stylish waitress at the bar of the hotel but he refuses to speak to her because, in his shyness, he fears that love would complicate his monotone but quiet life. The reasons behind Titta's strange existence gradually become apparent. Eight years ago, it is revealed, Titta was a broker who invested large sums of money. One day, he invested 250 billion Italian liras on behalf of Cosa Nostra, losing 220 billions in a few hours. By way of punishment, Titta was forced to live for the rest of his life as a mafia pawn, making regular deliveries of suitcases full of money to a Swiss bank. Titta's other secret is that he is a heroin user. Every Wednesday at ten a.m., he goes up to his hotel room and injects himself with the drug. One day, things start to happen: Titta's gregarious younger stepbrother turns up. He encourages Titta to engage with Sofia more. Later, two Mafia men suddenly arrive in his hotel room, which they intend to use as a base in order to carry out an assassination. As the two gangsters leave, they notice the suitcase containing the money that Titta must deliver that week. Sofia and Titta begin an awkward relationship which is romantic but not sexual. They go shopping together, and Titta buys her some shoes. Meanwhile, during Titta's trip to the bank that week, the bank staff counting the money by hand discover that there is $100,000 missing. Titta is already aware of this, but calmly pretends to be disgusted at their \"mistake\" and asks to close his account. His bluff achieves the intended result: in order to avoid offending him, and partly out of fear of the Mafia, the bank staff pretend that they miscounted, and so his theft goes unreported. It eventually turns out that Titta has stolen the money in order to buy an expensive car for Sofia. She is initially appalled by this gift, as she feels she does not know him well enough, but later comes up to his room to apologise and to try to discover more about him. Titta reveals all his secrets to her, and Sofia is so touched that she offers to celebrate his 50th birthday with him on the following evening. He accepts. The next day, the two Mafia assassins return and steal that week's suitcase. Titta panics and immediately telephones his Mafia contact, Pippo, who tells him to fly to Southern Italy that day to explain, but Titta says he will arrive in two days because he has an appointment to keep. However, when Sofia fails to turn up to celebrate his birthday, a despondent Titta, thinking that no-one loves him, leaves for the airport early. In reality, Sofia does not turn up because she has been in a car crash, and her ambulance passes Titta's car on the way out of town. Arriving at his destination, Titta is taken to a nearby hotel and, after waiting in a guestroom, is interrogated by the boss. Titta explains that he has recovered the money [in a flashback we see that when the money was initially stolen by the two men, Titta regained his composure, grabbed his gun and switched off the power for the elevator, forcing them to use the stairs as a getaway. This slowed them down, and Titta was able to use the lift himself to get to the carpark ahead of them. He hid in his car, and killed the duo when they arrived]. The boss asks Titta why he did not just deposit the money and save himself a trip, but Titta tells him that he does not want to give it back, because they stole his life. At this point, the Mafia boss ominously tells a subordinate to transfer Titta's account to someone else before asking Titta to tell him where the money is. Titta again refuses. He is led away by guards and the next morning is taken to a building site. Here he is suspended from a crane above a container of fresh concrete, and told that unless he reveals the money's whereabouts, he will be drowned in the concrete. As he has already given the money to the elderly aristocrats in the hotel, he refuses. The film ends with Titta being lowered into the concrete and thinking of his long-lost best friend Dino, who works as an electrician in the Alps.",

    "film_title": "The Edukators",
    "Synopsis": "Set in 2004, the film revolves around three young anti-capitalist activists in Berlin's city centre: Jule (Julia Jentsch), her boyfriend Peter (Stipe Erceg) and his best friend Jan (Daniel Brühl). Jule is a waitress struggling to pay off a €100,000 debt she incurred a year ago when she crashed into a Mercedes-Benz S-Class belonging to a wealthy businessman named Hardenberg (Burghart Klaußner). After her eviction for non-payment of rent, she moves in with Peter and Jan, who are often out all night. While Peter is in Barcelona, Jan tells Jule that he and Peter spend their nights \"educating\" upper-class people by breaking into their houses, moving furniture around and leaving notes saying \"die fetten Jahre sind vorbei\" (\"the days of plenty are over\") or \"Sie haben zu viel Geld\" (\"you have too much money\"). After hearing this, Jule convinces the reluctant Jan to break into Hardenberg's home in the affluent Berlin suburb of Zehlendorf while he is away on business. During the break-in, the thrill of the moment entices them to kiss before Jan leaves Jule alone for a few minutes; he does not want to destroy his friendship with Peter. As she wanders around outside Jule accidentally sets off the house's floodlights, and they quickly leave. When Peter returns the next day, Jan and Jule do not tell him about their activities the night before. Jule realises that her mobile phone is gone, and she and Jan leave later that night to look for it in the house. After she finds it, Hardenberg walks in the door and struggles with Jule when he recognises her. Hearing them, Jan comes downstairs and knocks Hardenberg unconscious with a flashlight. Not knowing what to do, they call Peter and he comes to their aid. The three cannot decide what to do with Hardenberg and take him to a remote, rarely used cabin belonging to Jule's uncle in the Tyrolean Austrian Alps near Jenbach, overlooking Achensee. As they try to decide how to deal with their hostage, they learn that Hardenberg was a radical himself during the 1960s. A leader of the Socialist German Student Union, he was a good friend of Rudi Dutschke before marrying, getting a good job and abandoning his ideals. As the story progresses, political ideology and the characters' relationships become the main issues. Peter and Jan temporarily fall out over Jan's developing romance with Jule, and Hardenberg seems to regain some of his former self. The trio finally decides that kidnapping Hardenberg was wrong and take him back to his house to let him go. As they prepare to leave, Hardenberg gives Jule a letter forgiving her debt and promising not to involve the police. The film ends with Peter, Jan and Jule asleep in the same bed as a group of heavily armed police (Spezialeinsatzkommando) gather outside their flat and knock on the door. Jule wakes up when she hears a knock, and the police force their way into the almost-empty flat. Apparently in Barcelona, Jule opens the door to a hotel maid who wishes to clean their room. In the Berlin apartment, the police find a note: \"Manche Menschen ändern sich nie\" (\"some people never change\"). In the original German version, the Edukators set off in Hardenberg's boat in the Mediterranean, presumably to disrupt the island signal towers supplying most television programming to Western Europe.",

Amalia lives with her attractive divorced mother, who owns the hotel, and her uncle Freddy. During this time, in Amalia's mind, spiritual and sexual impulses are getting mixed up with each other. A medical conference converges at the hotel. One day, in the midst of a large crowd watching the performance of a musician playing the theremin, Dr. Jano, a participant in the conference and hotel guest, rubs up sexually against Amalia.

    "film_title": "The Ladykillers (2004 film)",
    "Synopsis": "Mrs. Marva Munson, a strict, religious and elderly widow, meets \"Professor\" Goldthwaite Higginson Dorr, a classics professor who expresses interest in the room she has for rent and asks to use her root cellar for rehearsals of an early music ensemble he directs, to which she agrees. The fellow musicians in the pretend ensemble are actually a gang of criminals. The band is composed of a dim football player named Lump as the \"muscle\", the overconfident movie effects technician Garth Pancake as the \"jack of all trades\" (who suffers from IBS), the crass and sloppy Gawain McSam as their \"inside man\", and the Vietnamese, tough-as-nails General as their \"tunneling expert\" (who hides his chain smoking from the disapproving Mrs. Munson by concealing his cigarette in his mouth). The group of criminals plan to dig a tunnel through the exposed wall in the cellar in order to break into the underground vault for a nearby riverboat casino. The dirt they remove is taken out at night and tossed off a bridge onto a garbage barge as it passes below. A series of mishaps threaten to derail their plan, including \"inside man\" Gawain losing his janitorial job at the casino, Mrs. Munson's cat Pickles running off with Garth's finger when he accidentally sets a plastic explosive off in his hand, and a visit from the local sheriff. Nonetheless, the group manages to break through the wall of the vault and snatch the loot. Before the group can get away, Mrs. Munson uncovers the plot and tells Dorr to return the money and go with her to church on Sunday, or face the authorities. Dorr attempts to persuade her otherwise, by claiming that the casino's insurance company will replace the money, resulting in each shareholder losing only a single penny. He also claims he will donate a full share of the stolen funds to Bob Jones University, a Bible college which Mrs. Munson admires, but she insists on her judgment. The gang decides they have no choice but to murder her. None of them are eager to kill an old woman so they draw straws. The task falls to Gawain but he fails to go through with it after he realizes Mrs. Munson reminds him of his mother. This starts a fight between Garth and Gawain which results in Gawain being fatally shot with his own gun; the group dumps his body off the bridge onto the trash barge. Garth then attempts to steal the entire sum of money and escape with his girlfriend, \"Mountain Girl,\" but the General kills them both with a garotte wire and discards their bodies onto the barge. After drawing lots again, the General is about to kill Mrs. Munson in her sleep, concealing his cigarette in his mouth as per usual. He is suddenly startled by a cuckoo clock, accidentally swallowing his cigarette. In a frenzied search for water, The General trips over Mrs. Munson's cat and falls down the stairs to his death. As Lump and Dorr dispose of The General's body onto the barge, Lump has a change of heart and tells Dorr he wants to do what Mrs. Munson says. When Dorr refuses, Lump attempts to shoot him with a revolver but the chamber is empty; he peers down the barrel and accidentally shoots himself with the round that was in the next chamber, falling off the bridge onto the barge. Dorr, now alone, pauses to admire a passing raven and recite poetry until the raven dislodges the head of a crumbling gargoyle on top of the bridge. The head falls, knocking Dorr over the railing, and his cape gets caught on the ironwork and breaks his neck, killing him instantly. As the barge passes under the bridge, the fabric tears and he too falls onto it. Finding the stolen money in her basement, Mrs. Munson believes that the criminals have fled and left it behind. She informs the police about the money, but they think she is insane and tell her to keep it; she decides to donate it to Bob Jones University. The Ladykillers ends by showing Pickles dropping Garth's severed finger onto the barge.",

    "film_title": "The Life and Death of Peter Sellers",
    "Synopsis": "The film opens with Peter Sellers walking to a director's chair. An unseen live audience applauds as Peter directs his gaze toward the movie of his life. In 1950s London, Peter Sellers became a household name as a performer on The Goon Show but failed to branch out into film. He returns home to his family after a failed audition but is urged by his controlling mother Peg (Miriam Margolyes) to \"bite the hand that feeds you\". A now-inspired Peter uses his talent for impersonation to become the elderly World War I veteran character he auditioned for. Once the casting agent (Alison Steadman), who rejected him earlier, has said that he is perfect for the role, Peter reveals himself and is reluctantly given the part. Peter wins a British Academy Award for I'm All Right Jack. Peg and Peter's father, Bill (Peter Vaughan), watch their son's acceptance speech but are dismissed by Peg, a dejected Bill walks away leading to the first transformation of the film; Peter is now playing his father, and with a heavy Yorkshire accent breaks the fourth wall to tell us about Peter's childhood. Before the shooting of The Millionairess has begun, Peter is already besotted with his co-star Sophia Loren (Sonia Aquino), while his marriage to wife Anne (Emily Watson) is becoming strained and his children are subjected to their father's rages and subsequent extravagant gifts as compensation. When Sophia mentions that Peter is too far away in the countryside to take her home, he takes this as a cue to buy a house in the heart of London. To subdue some of the guilt Peter feels about his feelings for Sophia, he hires a decorator, Ted Levy, and insists that his wife and Ted should have drinks together. Peter leaves them and goes to have dinner alone with Sophia, who is surprised that Peter's wife is not joining them and slowly realises that this is a date. She rejects Peter's advances and tells him to go home to his family. Seeing Carlo Ponti (Joseph Long) has come to visit his wife Sophia on set, Sellers distracts himself with Sophia's stand-in, and the two have sex in Peter's Rolls-Royce. Meanwhile, a weary Anne surrenders to quietly spending the night with Ted. Once Peter returns home and realises his wife has left, he wreaks havoc in the house. Anne comes home the morning after to find Peter on the balcony threatening to jump if she leaves. The two argue and Anne walks out. We then see Peter's second transformation, this time in drag as Anne, who is dubbing the breakup to make it look as though they had reconciled. Peter returns home to Peg's care to recuperate after the divorce and begins to see Maurice Woodruff (Stephen Fry), a clairvoyant to the stars, hoping to gain some direction; Woodruff's influence leads him to the Pink Panther series. Filming of The Pink Panther begins and his portrayal is a huge success, but Peter is disappointed with the final product and blames Blake Edwards (John Lithgow). Peter returns to England to find his father on life support, which Peg had been keeping from him. After Bill has stated how proud he is of his son, he dies. Peter is heartbroken and cannot forgive Peg for not calling him; their close bond is irreversibly severed and Peter leaves. At The Dorchester Hotel, Stanley Kubrick (Stanley Tucci), persuades Peter to be in his new film, Dr. Strangelove. Peg comes to visit Peter on-set, but Peter decides to stay in character as the titular scientist to avoid confronting reality. Peg is unsettled and eventually leaves, feeling as though she has not truly seen her son. While Stanley and Peter are discussing the fourth character he is due to play, Peter grows aggravated about his workload, insisting he will not play the American bomber pilot. After he storms off, we watch the third change; Peter becomes Stanley, who turns to look at us with the Kubrick stare and tells us that Peter Sellers was not a person, simply a vessel, “but even an empty vessel can become too full”. Meanwhile, Maurice Woodruff is taking a bribe to convince Peter to do another Pink Panther film. Peter instead pursues his new neighbour Britt Ekland (Charlize Theron). He asks her to be his date at the cinema where they see Dr. Strangelove. They marry just ten days after meeting. While on their honeymoon in Hollywood, Peter inhales amyl nitrites during sex, causing him to have a series of eight heart attacks. He is rushed to the hospital and Peg watches the breaking news of Peter's critical condition. During the resuscitation, a dream sequence takes place in Peter's consciousness with his many characters surrounding him, before he notices that he has a ticking bomb attached to his chest. When he wakes, he believes himself to now be invincible. Peter's next film is Casino Royale, but with his new lease of life, he wants to play it straight, much to the dismay of everyone involved. He abandons the film after no-one takes him seriously. Britt informs Peter that she has fallen pregnant, but is met with an unimpressed Peter, who doesn't want more children and suggests an abortion. However, Britt insists on keeping the baby. Once the baby is born, Peter and Britt's relationship becomes strained and they fight as the newborn interrupts scenes of After The Fox. Peter receives a call from Peg, who tells Peter that she is in the hospital and that she needs to see him. However, Peter pretends to be called away and hangs up. The fourth narrative change is Peter becoming Peg, who defends Peter's behaviour, just as the real Peg always did. As Peg, he climbs into a coffin before reverting to himself. Peter is distraught at Peg's funeral and Britt tries to comfort him, but he instead cries on his first wife Anne's shoulder. When they get home, Peter antagonises Britt while she is trying to comfort him. A physical fight ensues and Britt smashes a picture of Peg over Peter's head. She leaves for good, taking their daughter with her, and Peter is alone with his thoughts, triggering a psychedelic sequence that swiftly takes Peter through the 70s. During one of their sessions, Woodruff listens to Peter talk about his obsession with Being There, a book Peter loves so much that he wants it to be his next film. However, Woodruff uses the spirit of Peg to persuade Peter to instead make The Pink Panther Strikes Again and a superstitious Peter relents. At the screening for the film, a drunken Peter gives a speech which becomes more and more uninhibited until he abruptly leaves. Watching his home movies alone, Peter gets a voicemail from his now adult son Michael, who wishes him well with his new pacemaker. Once the recording ends, Peter looks to the table beside him and opens the script for Revenge of the Pink Panther. In costume as the \"old salty Swedish sea dog\", Peter collapses in his trailer while an unaware Blake bangs at his door. The fifth and final transformation is Peter into Blake Edwards, who tells us what it is like to work with the \"difficult\" but \"mesmerising\" Peter Sellers. The only project Peter never gave up on was Being There. Scenes of Peter carefully constructing the main character in his home are interspersed with him destroying his memorabilia, including some of his home movies. Peter is exasperated that he can not find the look of Chance but meditates on the memory of his lowly father and bases the look on him. Peter quietly rewatches scenes from Being There, proud of something he made. A tired and visibly prematurely aging Peter walks through the Swiss snow to meet with Blake Edwards, who has the script for The Romance of the Pink Panther. Instead of entering, Peter hesitates and watches through the window, eventually turning to stand motionless under a streetlight. Blake comes out, confused to find Peter standing perfectly still. They do not share a word and Blake kisses Peter on the cheek, eventually leaving him alone. Facts about the final years of Sellers' life are shown over the motionless Peter in the snow. The film finishes with the same version of Peter that we saw at the start. The movie about his life has now ended. He sits in the director's chair and shrugs, stands up, and walks through the film's set pieces, surrounded by bustling crew, to his trailer and smiles to the camera, \"You can't come in here.\"",

    "film_title": "The Motorcycle Diaries (film)",
    "Synopsis": "In 1952, a semester before Ernesto \"Fuser\" Guevara is due to complete his medical degree, he and his older friend Alberto Granado, a biochemist, leave Buenos Aires to travel across South America. While there is a goal at the end of their journey – they intend to work in a leper colony in Peru – the main purpose is initially fun and adventure. They desire to see as much of Latin America as they can, more than in just four and a half months, while Granado's purpose is also to bed as many women as will fall for his pickup lines. Their initial method of transport is Granado's dilapidated Norton 500 motorcycle christened La Poderosa (\"The Mighty One\"). Their planned route is ambitious, bringing them north across the Andes, along the coast of Chile, through the Atacama Desert and into the Peruvian Amazon in order to reach Venezuela just in time for Granado's 30th birthday on 2 April. However, due to La Poderosa's breakdown, they are forced to travel at a much slower pace, often walking, and do not make it to Caracas until July. During their expedition, Guevara and Granado encounter the poverty of the indigenous peasants, and the movie assumes a greater seriousness once the men gain a better sense of the disparity between the \"haves\" (to which they belong) and the obviously exploited \"have-nots\" (who make up the majority of those they encounter) by travelling on foot. In Chile, for instance, they encounter a penniless and persecuted couple forced onto the road because of their communist beliefs. In a fire-lit scene, Guevara and Granado ashamedly admit to the couple that they are not out looking for work as well. The duo then accompanies the couple to the Chuquicamata copper mine, where Guevara becomes angry at the treatment of the workers. However, it is a visit to the ancient Incan ruins of Machu Picchu in Peru that solidifies something in Guevara. His musings are then somberly refocused to how an indigenous civilization capable of building such beauty could be destroyed by the creators of the eventually polluted urban decay of nearby Lima. Later, in Peru, they volunteer for three weeks at the San Pablo leper colony. There, Guevara observes both literally and metaphorically the division of society, as the staff live on the north side of a river, separated from the deprived lepers living across the river to the south. To demonstrate his solidarity, and his medical belief that leprosy is not contagious, Guevara refuses to wear rubber gloves during his visit as the head nun requires, choosing instead to shake bare hands and interact normally with the surprised leper patients. At the end of the film, after his sojourn at the leper colony, Guevara confirms his nascent egalitarian, revolutionary impulses, while making a birthday toast, which is also his first political speech. In it, he calls for the unification of South America on the basis of the unity of the Mestizo people. These encounters with social injustice transform the way Guevara sees the world and his purposes in it, and by implication motivates his later political activities as a Marxist revolutionary. Guevara makes his symbolic \"final journey\" at night when, despite the danger and his asthma, he swims across the river that separates the two societies of the leper colony, to spend the night in a leper shack, instead of in the doctors' cabins. Later, as they bid each other farewell at an airport, Granado reveals that his birthday was not 2 April, but rather 8 August, and that the aforementioned goal was simply a motivator: Guevara replies that he knew all along. The film closes with an appearance by the real 82-year-old Alberto Granado, along with pictures from the actual journey and a brief mention of Che Guevara's eventual 1967 CIA-assisted execution in the Bolivian jungle.",

    "Synopsis": "Keng (Banlop Lomnoi) is a soldier assigned to a post in a small city in rural Thailand. The troop's main duty is to investigate the mysterious slaying of cattle at local farms. While in the field one day, Keng briefly meets a villager named Tong (Sakda Kaewbuadee). Later, Keng sees Tong riding in a truck, they talk some more, and a romantic friendship soon develops between them. Keng helps Tong with his job at an ice factory. One night while driving an ice delivery truck, they find a sick dog on the side of the road. They bring it to a veterinarian, but learn that it has cancer. Tong signs a form to allow it to undergo chemotherapy. Later, the two of them go to a movie theater. While sitting together the next day, they are approached by an older woman who tells a story on how two poor farmers lost an opportunity to become rich. In the story, a young monk instructed them to collect rocks from a nearby pond. When the farmers brought the rocks back, those turned to silver and gold. When they greedily went back for more though, the silver and gold bars they had previously obtained turned into frogs. Keng, Tong, and the older woman spend the rest of the afternoon together, walking through a cave and meeting the woman's friends. One night, Keng and Tong ride around the city on a motorcycle. While stopped on the side of the road, they share a brief romantic moment, only for Tong to abruptly wander off into the dark. Keng and his troops leave the village the next day. Some time later, Keng overhears some people saying a monster keeps killing their cattle. A soldier (Lomnoi) is sent alone into the woods to kill the spirit of a tiger shaman (Kaewbuadee). He follows its pawprints and waits by a tree once it gets dark. When he wakes up the next morning, he finds himself face to face with the shaman in human form. He chases and fights it, but is knocked unconscious and pushed down a steep slope. When he wakes up, he still has his gun, but his radio and backpack are destroyed. A monkey tells the soldier he needs to kill the shaman; otherwise, the soldier will be devoured and will enter the shaman's ghost world. When it gets dark again, the soldier hears a sound in the distance and fires his gun in that direction, only to discover he killed a cow. The cow's spirit then rises from its body and walks towards a glowing tree. As the soldier walks away, the shaman (now in the form of a tiger) follows him. The soldier loses his gun and begins walking on his hands and knees until he comes across the tiger shaman in a tree. After staring at each other for a while, the soldier says \"I give you my spirit, my flesh, and my memories\" as a graphical image of the tiger shaman absorbing him is shown. The soldier continues looking up at the tiger shaman as the wind picks up.",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words --> Tom Stall is a diner owner who lives in the rural town of Millbrook, Indiana, with wife Edie, teenage son Jack, and daughter Sarah. One night, two spree killers attempt to rob the restaurant. When a waitress is threatened, Tom deftly kills both robbers with skill and precision. He is hailed as a hero, and the story is picked up by the national news media. Soon after, Tom is visited by Philadelphia-based mobster Carl Fogarty, who alleges that Tom is actually a former mob hitman named Joey Cusack. He vehemently denies this, but Carl remains persistent and begins to stalk the Stall family. Under pressure from him and his newfound fame, Tom's relationship with his family becomes strained. Following an argument with Tom over the use of violence on a bully at his school, Jack runs away. He is caught by Carl, who, with Jack as his hostage, goes with his henchmen to the Stall house and demands that \"Joey\" return to Philadelphia with them. After the gangsters release Jack, Tom efficiently kills one of the two henchmen and severely injures the other, but Carl shoots and incapacitates him. Tom finally admits he is Joey. Before Carl can shoot him dead, Jack kills him. At the hospital, Edie confronts Tom, who admits to being Joey Cusack. He tells her that he ran from Philadelphia to escape his criminal past. This admission deepens the tensions in their marriage. After Tom gets out of the hospital, the local sheriff Sam expresses his concern and suspicions. Just as he is about to confess, Edie lies to Sam and convinces him to leave. The couple then gets into a domestic dispute, culminating in violent sex. Afterward, Edie and Jack continue to further distance themselves from Tom, leaving him isolated. Tom's brother, crime boss Richie Cusack, calls him and demands his return to Philadelphia, threatening to come to Indiana if he does not. In Philadelphia, Tom learns that the mobsters he offended took out their frustrations on Richie, penalizing him financially and delaying his advancement in the organization. Tom offers to make peace, but Richie orders his men to kill his brother. Tom manages to kill most of the gangsters and escapes. As Richie and his last henchman are hunting for him, Tom kills the henchman, takes his gun, and kills Richie with a single gunshot to the head. Tom returns home, where the atmosphere is tense and silent as the family sits around the dinner table. His young daughter eventually hands him a dinner plate. Some moments later, his son offers him a communal plate of food, and Edie looks at Tom with tears in her eyes.",

    "Synopsis": "Marcos (Marcos Hernández) is a working class man in Mexico City, employed by \"the general.\" Marcos learns that the baby that he and his wife kidnapped for ransom had accidentally died. The remainder of the film follows a despondent Marcos, seemingly haunted by the moral and/or legal implications of his actions. Marcos stands next to his wife Berta (Berta Ruiz) at the subway as she sells clocks and sweets at a stand. He travels to the airport to meet the \"general's\" upper-middle class daughter, Ana (Anapola Mushkadiz) whom he has known since she was a child. Ana orders Marcos to take her to the \"boutique\" where she works in the sex trade. While driving, Marcos is very distracted, and at one point stalls the car. Ana recognizes that something is wrong, but Marcos claims he's distracted only because of his wife's supposed ill health. Ana invites Marcos into the \"boutique\" so that he can have sex with one of her \"friends.\" Marcos is apparently not aroused by the \"friend.\" The friend tells Ana that Marcos would prefer her instead. Ana goes to talk to Marcos, and reminds him that they have known each other since her childhood. Marcos then reveals that he and his wife kidnapped a baby but the baby died before they could collect any ransom. Ana seems to remain composed at hearing this news. Back home, Marcos has sex with his wife, Berta. They seem united in their sorrow regarding the dead baby. Marcos tells Berta that he told Ana about the kidnapped baby, indicating that the confession brought him relief. Berta, upset, demands that he make sure that \"the princess\" does not tell anyone. The next day, Marcos visits Ana. She seems annoyed by his visit, but drives him to her place where they have sex. Ana advises Marcos to turn himself in to the police. Marcos, Berta, their son, and a few friends (including the mother of the dead baby, who does not know who took her child, nor that it has died) go out to the countryside. Marcos tells Berta that he is going to turn himself in. She asks him to wait until after the pilgrimage (which is in honor of the Lady of Guadalupe), an event that Marcos had earlier shown disdain for. Marcos seems to agree with his wife. Marcos' mental state seems to worsen. Instead of driving back with his party, he treks through the countryside. He reaches a peak with Christian crosses, overlooking a valley. Marcos buries his face in his hands. Marcos visits Ana at her home. He tells her that he will turn himself into the police that day. She gives him a goodbye kiss. Marcos leaves the apartment. He urinates his pants, goes back to the apartment and fatally stabs Ana. The police become aware of both the attack on Ana and the death of the baby, and are in search for Marcos. Marcos seems to have joined the pilgrimage to the Basilica, at first on foot, and then on his knees. Someone places a hood over his face, but Marcos continues to hobble forward. The hood becomes increasingly stained with blood as he makes his way into the Basilica during the church service. Eventually the pilgrims are gone, and the Basilica is vacant. The police allow Berta to go in to see her husband. She touches him on the head and he collapses. The film ends with a scene of Ana giving a fellatio to Marcos as he says \"I love you, Ana\". She replies \"I love you too, Marcos\".",

    "Synopsis": "Don Johnston, a former Don Juan who made a small fortune in the computer industry, wants to live in quiet retirement. He is content to lounge around watching old movies and listening to classical or easy listening music. His current girlfriend, Sherry, is ending their relationship and moving out of his house when a letter in a pink envelope arrives. Later Don reads the letter; it purports to be from an unnamed former girlfriend, informing him that he has a son who is nearly nineteen years old, and who may be looking for him. Initially, Don does not intend to do anything about it, but his busybody neighbor Winston, who is a mystery novel enthusiast, urges Don to investigate. Winston researches the current locations of the five women most likely to have written the letter and gives Don the information along with maps and flight reservations, and persuades him to visit them. Ultimately Don meets with four women (the fifth one had died before the events of the film), each encounter worse than the last and each woman damaged in some way: * Laura works as a closet and drawer organizer and is the widow of a race car driver. She is very warm and receptive to Don's visit, but has an uninhibited daughter, Lolita, who walks around the house without any clothes on before her mother arrives. Both mom and daughter are oblivious to the implications of the name \"Lolita\". That night, Laura sleeps with Don. * Dora is a realtor. Once a \"flower child\" of the 1960s, she is now living a suburban conservative upper-middle class existence married to Ron. The couple sell neatly prefabricated houses and serve Don a meal of similar construction and character. The encounter, while friendly on the surface, belies a great deal of tension with Ron coming across as threatening, and Dora as pained and nervous. * Carmen Markowski works as an \"animal communicator\". Don recalls how she was formerly so passionate about becoming a lawyer. She is cold to Don and seems to have a close relationship with her secretary, who is very protective of her and unimpressed by Don's sudden visit. * Penny lives in a rural area amongst bikers. She appears to still harbor a great deal of resentment toward Don, and when he asks if she has a son, she becomes furious. Two men appear and beat Don up. The next morning, Don finds himself in his car, in the middle of a field, with a nasty cut near his left eye. Later, Don stops at a florist to buy flowers from a young woman named Sun Green who treats his cut. Don leaves the flowers at the grave of the fifth woman, Michelle Pepe. Finally, Don returns home where he finds a pink letter from Sherry, admitting she still likes him. He discusses the trip and second letter with Winston, who theorizes that Sherry might have written the original letter as a hoax. He then goes home to compare the two letters. Don then meets a young man in the street (who was seen earlier) whom he suspects may be his son. He buys him a meal, but when he remarks that the young man believes that Don is his father, the young man becomes agitated and flees. Don attempts to chase the man but gives up, standing in the middle of a crossroads. Don watches a Volkswagen Beetle drive past and sees in it a young man who resembles him. The young man wears the same type of Fred Perry tracksuit as Don and makes eye contact with him, while the same music Don had listened to on his trip plays from the passing car.",

    "Synopsis": "Affluent Parisian couple Anne and Georges Laurent discover on their property a videotape that shows hours of footage of their residence, implying they are under surveillance. They debate its origin and purpose, considering whether it is a practical joke from friends of their 12-year-old son, Pierrot, or the work of fans of Georges, who hosts a literary television show. A second tape arrives, accompanied by a childlike drawing of a person with blood streaming out of his mouth. Similar drawings are mailed to Georges's workplace and Pierrot's school. Disturbed, the Laurents turn to the police, who do not consider the tapes and drawings criminal activities. Another videotape, with a drawing of a chicken bleeding at its neck, is delivered amidst a dinner party hosted by the Laurents. As Anne discloses the incidents to their friends, Georges plays the tape, which shows the estate where he grew up. Georges begins to have vivid dreams about Majid, a boy he knew in childhood. Majid's Algerian parents worked on Georges's family estate but disappeared in the Paris massacre of 1961. Georges's parents intended to adopt Majid, but the process was never finalised. Suspecting Majid might be responsible for the tapes, Georges visits his ailing mother, who surprisingly professes not to remember Majid well. The Laurents receive another tape showing a low-income housing apartment. Georges tells Anne he has a suspect in mind, but will not say who until he can confirm his suspicion. Anne is shocked by the perceived lack of trust. Following the clues in the tape, Georges locates the apartment off Avenue Lénine in Romainville, where Majid lives. Majid denies knowledge of the tapes or drawing, but the suspicious Georges threatens him. A hidden camera recorded the conversation with Majid, who breaks down crying after Georges leaves, and tapes of the encounter are sent to Anne and Georges's employer. Georges explains to Anne that he was six when he learned of his parents' plan to adopt Majid. Disliking the plan, he told lies about Majid, who was sent away. When Pierrot disappears, the Laurents frantically contact the police, who check Majid's apartment and arrest Majid and Majid's son, though they deny involvement in kidnapping. Pierrot returns to his family, having spent time with friends, and hints to Anne that he thinks she is too close to Pierre, a family friend. Majid calls Georges and asks him to come back to the apartment. When Georges arrives, Majid denies having sent the tapes, says he wanted Georges present, and kills himself by slashing his throat. Georges confesses to Anne that as a boy, he had claimed Majid was coughing up blood and convinced Majid to kill the family's rooster, falsely claiming his father wanted him to. The police confirm the cause of death as suicide, but Majid's son appears at Georges's workplace to confront him. Believing the son is responsible for the tapes, Georges threatens him to cease surveillance, but the son replies he was not involved with the tapes and wanted to know how Georges felt about being responsible for a death. Later, Majid's son converses with Pierrot after school.",

    "Synopsis": "In Hong Kong, the Hongmen-descendant and 50,000-strong triad Wo Lin Shing elects a new chairman every two years. The two leading contenders of the current election, Lok and Big D, carry out some last-minute \"campaigning\". Lok is calm, patient and even-tempered, while Big D, who attempts to buy the election with bribes, is boisterous, impatient and quick-tempered. After some quarrelling among both candidates' supporters, the triad's elders elect Lok as the new chairman. Big D refuses to honour the result, and instead attempts to obtain the triad's dragonhead baton, a symbol of the chairman's authority, from Whistle, the previous chairman. Whistle orders for the baton to be hidden. Lok also has his supporters search for the baton. The police step in to prevent infighting and maintain the peace by arresting the triad's key figures, including Whistle, Big D, and Lok, who is handcuffed and taken away in front of his young son. However, due to a lack of incriminating evidence, the triad members can only be temporarily detained. During the arrest, Big D attacks Whistle, causing Whistle to be hit by a car. A grievously injured Whistle indicates intent to testify to the police's anti-triad unit to expose Big D; this extends Big D's detention. Not wanting the triad's crimes to be exposed, Lok has his lawyer convince Whistle to kill himself to ensure Whistle's family's safety. While in custody, the police allow the triad elders to try to broker peace, but Big D threatens to break away from Wo Lin Shing and form a new triad, which would upset triad tradition and bring about much violence; this causes most of the triad to unite against Big D. Various triad members attempt to retrieve the baton, including Jimmy, whose triad member uncle and boss were both severely injured by Big D for supposedly costing him the election. After some intercepting and fighting between triad members, Jimmy ultimately acquires the baton, and gives it to Lok after Lok states that he can improve the triad's earnings. Lok rewards those who assisted him in obtaining the baton (Big Head, Jet, Jimmy, Kun, and Mr. So) with privileges of becoming his godsons. Big D is released on bail after it is paid by Lok. Using the baton, Lok secures his position as the triad's new chairman and offers a deal to Big D. If Big D accepts Lok as chairman, they will take over the lucrative Tsim Sha Tsui area together, Lok will protect Big D's businesses and support Big D for chairmanship at the next election in two years; Big D accepts. The high-ranking triad members, including Lok and Big D, pledge loyalty to each other and the triad during Lok's swearing-in ceremony. When a rival triad boss offers Big D the chance to improve his earnings on the condition that Big D betray Lok, Big D reacts by calling Lok in for an apparent ambush. This is a double cross; Lok and Big D trap and murder the rival triad boss. Eventually, Lok and Big D successfully take over Tsim Sha Tsui. During a fishing trip, Big D expresses interest in becoming a co-chairman of the triad along with Lok, pointing out that other triads have such arrangements. Lok responds that this is not their triad's tradition, but Big D does not change his mind. Lok feigns supporting Big D's idea, then murders Big D with a rock; this is witnessed by Lok's son and Big D's wife. She tries to flee, but Lok strangles her to death. Lok buries Big D and his wife and leaves the scene with his shaken son.",

She has just ended her marriage with a Jewish man, Breitberg, after he tells her of having raped a Palestinian woman while he was a soldier. Rebecca herself has a Jewish father but a gentile mother and so, despite her Jewish upbringing, is not considered a Jew according to religious tradition. Crying openly, Rebecca enters a tourist cab, driven by a Jewish Israeli woman, Hanna (Hanna Laslo), who is the daughter of Holocaust survivors. Hanna's destination, to which Rebecca agrees to accompany her, is the free-trade zone or \"Free Zone\" near Jordan's borders with Syria, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia to collect money owed to her husband, who has recently been wounded in a rocket attack. Upon reaching the Free Zone, they meet up with Laila (Hiam Abbass), a Palestinian woman who serves as the contact for Hanna's husband's black market partnership with a man known as \"the American.\" The three women set off on a tense journey to retrieve Hanna's money and to find the American's son, Walid, who may have absconded with the money. The film is bookended by a rendition of the traditional Passover song \"Had Gadya\", performed by Chava Alberstein. The song \"Ain Ani\" by Shotei Hanevua also plays in the taxi at the end of the film.",

    "Synopsis": "The story begins with a road trip story set in Iraqi Kurdistan during the Iran–Iraq War in 1988. The radio announcer is describing the events happening. The scene then switches to a Kurdish village a few weeks before the Halabja poison gas attack where Ako, a young Kurdish man, is forced to join the Iraqi Army, while he is dreaming of escaping the country. A few dramatic scenes follow, some of them being flashbacks of home. Ako is sent to the frontline with a few Kurdish comrades and is subject to abuse by the other Iraqi soldiers, due to his Kurdish background. There are other scenes depicting abuse also. In one, a man is beaten for refusing to run laps with the others. In another, a firing squad is seen in executing captured Kurdish guerillas. When Ako is given a mission to escort the coffin of a dead Iraqi soldier to his family, an unexpected opportunity for escaping comes up. His driver turns out to be an Arab with strong feeling against the Kurds. They are given a small car with the coffin draped in an Iraqi flag, strapped to the top.

The next day, he gets home and changes his clothes. He walks around in the house with a shotgun, pointing it at his sleeping roommates Scott, Luke, Asia, and Nicole. He is greeted by Yellow Pages representative Thadeus A. Thomas who talks to him about placing an ad in the upcoming book. He receives a phone call from his record company telling him that he and his band have to do another tour and that it is important they make the booked dates, but Blake hangs up. He goes upstairs and falls asleep on the floor in one of the rooms. Asia awakes and finds him asleep as two LDS missionaries arrive at the door.

    "Synopsis": "Alain Getty is a Home Automation Engineer who accepts a job in the south of France to work on a small camera drone in a technology company owned by Richard Pollock, and moves to a suburb of Toulouse with his wife Bénédicte. After three months, Richard invites himself and his wife Alice to dinner at Alain's house. They arrive late and create a scene with their marital problems; Alice is very rude to Bénédicte. Alain discovers a rodent lodged in the S-bend of the kitchen sink, which recovers after Alain retrieves it. A veterinarian identifies it as a lemming, a Scandinavian animal that does not live in France in the wild. The next evening Alice visits Alain, working late at his office. She says that Richard once tried to kill her and that the only reason she is still with him is to see him die. She attempts to seduce Alain, who resists her advances, but doesn't tell Bénédicte about the incident. Alice visits Bénédicte alone, and alludes to having had sex with Alain, before saying she feels tired. Bénédicte shows her the guest bedroom, where she creates a mess and eventually shoots herself. Bénédicte feels an urge to spend the night in the guestroom where Alice committed suicide. Despite Alice's death, Richard and Alain go on a business trip to Biarritz the next day. During the drive, Alain asks Richard if he had really tried to kill Alice. In response, Richard asks Alain if he and Alice had sex, which Alain denies. That evening, Alain calls Bénédicte, who initially doesn't answer, then abuses him. Concerned, Alain decides to drive home immediately, although it is late and he is tired. He finds Bénédicte sleeping and is unable to wake her. He hears noises coming from the kitchen, discovers it is full of lemmings and faints. Alain wakes up in a hospital; he crashed after falling asleep at the wheel, and the previous night's events were apparently a dream. Upon Alain's release from the hospital, he and Bénédicte visit Richard's lakeside holiday chalet. Bénédicte continues to behave coldly. She asks why Alain hadn't told her about Alice's attempt to seduce him, using the exact words Alice used that night and asks Alain to call her \"Alice\". They have sex and Alain falls asleep. When he wakes, Bénédicte and their car are gone. Alain hitches a ride home and discovers that Bénédicte started an affair with Richard while he was in hospital and is about to move into his house. Alain uses his drone to observe Richard's house, and finds Bénédicte as expected. As Richard and Bénédicte are about to have sex, the camera fails. It appears that Alice has taken control of Bénédicte and resumed her life with Richard inside Bénédicte's body. Meanwhile, the vet returns the lemming to Alain's house. The lemming bites Alain and disappears in the house. The next day, Richard confronts Alain at work with pieces of the drone he found in the garden. That evening, \"Alice-Bénédicte\" visits Alain to offer him a deal: If he kills Richard, he would get Bénédicte back. She gives Alain the key to Richard's house and leaves. That night Alain goes to Richard's house. He finds Richard and \"Alice-Bénédicte\" asleep in the bedroom, and smothers Richard with a pillow while \"Alice-Bénédicte\" watches. Alain carries Richard's body to the kitchen, where he operates the coffee-machine and the gas stove. \"Alice-Bénédicte\" follows him to the car in a trance-like state. Back at their house, \"Alice-Bénédicte\" goes straight to bed. When she wakes up, she is Bénédicte again—she says she dreamt of Alice, but doesn't remember any of the recent events. The next day, the couple are in their garden when they receive news of Richard's apparent suicide by causing a gas explosion in his house. Bénédicte innocently asks Alain if he believes Richard committed suicide because of Alice's death. She then discovers the dead lemming and throws it away. The mystery of its origin is resolved by Alain in a voice over: Their neighbours' son had brought the animal from a family holiday to Finland; his upset father then flushed it down the toilet. Finally, Alain mentions that Bénédicte is pregnant.",

    "film_title": "Manderlay",
    "Synopsis": "The film is told in eight straight chapters: # In which we happen upon Manderlay and meet the people there # \"The freed enterprise of Manderlay\" # \"The Old Lady's Garden\" # In which Grace means business # \"Shoulder to Shoulder\" # Hard times at Manderlay # \"Harvest\" # In which Grace settles with Manderlay and the film ends Set in 1933, the film takes up the story of Grace and her father after burning the town of Dogville at the end of the previous film. Grace and her father travel in convoy with a number of gunmen through rural Alabama where they stop briefly outside a plantation called Manderlay. As the gangsters converse, a black woman emerges from Manderlay's front gates complaining that someone is about to be whipped for stealing a bottle of wine. Grace enters the plantation and learns that within it, slavery persists, roughly 70 years after the American Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation. Grace is appalled and insists on staying at the plantation with a small contingent of gunmen and her father's lawyer, Joseph, in order to guarantee the slaves' safe transition to freedom. Shortly after Grace's father and the remaining gangsters depart, Mam, the master of the house, dies, but not before asking Grace to burn a notebook containing \"Mam's Law,\" an exhaustive code of conduct for the entire plantation and all its inhabitants, free and slave. She reads the descriptions of each variety of slave that can be encountered, which include: * Group 1: Proudy Nigger * Group 2: Talkin' Nigger * Group 3: Weepin' Nigger * Group 4: Hittin' Nigger * Group 5: Clownin' Nigger * Group 6: Losin' Nigger * Group 7: Pleasin' Nigger (also known as a chameleon, a person of the kind who can transform himself into exactly the type the beholder would like to see) The principal seven divisions are each populated by a single adult slave at Manderlay, who congregate daily and converse on a \"parade ground,\" with Roman numerals of the numbers 1 through 7 designating where each slave stands. \"Mam's Law\" contains further provisions against the use of cash by slaves, or the felling of trees on the property for timber. All of this information disgusts Grace and inspires her to take charge of the plantation in order to punish the slave owners and prepare the slaves for life as free individuals. In order to guarantee that the former slaves will not continue to be exploited, no longer as slaves but instead as sharecroppers, Grace orders Joseph to draw up contracts for all Manderlay's inhabitants, institutionalizing a form of cooperative living in which the white family works as slaves and the blacks collectively own the plantation and its crops. Throughout this process, Grace lectures all those present about the notions of freedom and democracy, using rhetoric entirely in keeping with the ideology of racial equality which most contemporary Americans had yet to embrace. However, as the film progresses, Grace fails to embed these principles in Manderlay's community in a form she considers satisfactory. Furthermore, her suggestions for improving the conditions of the community backfire on several occasions, such as using the surrounding trees for timber, which leaves the crops vulnerable to dust storms. After a year of such tribulations, the community harvests its cotton and successfully sells it, marking the high point of Grace's involvement. Subsequently, she un-enthusiastically has sex with one of the ex-slaves who also steals and gambles away all of the cotton profits. Finally admitting her failure, Grace contacts her father and attempts to leave the plantation only to be stopped by the plantation's blacks. At this point it is revealed that \"Mam's Law\" was not conceived and enforced by Mam or any of the other whites, but instead by Wilhelm, the community's eldest member, as a means of maintaining the status quo after the abolition of slavery, protecting the blacks from a hostile outside world. The people of Manderlay then tell Grace to punish Timothy for what he did by whipping him. Grace then finds a letter from her father, explaining that he came to get her while she was whipping Timothy. He assumed that this was what she meant by claiming that Manderlay had come upon new times and that she had accepted them as slaves. Grace then runs away to another unrevealed place. As in many von Trier films, the idealistic main character becomes frustrated by the reality he or she encounters.",

Junior is the son of the corrupt and powerful Senator Roark, who has bribed Hartigan's corrupt partner, Bob, to cover up his son's crimes. Bob tries to persuade Hartigan to walk away; Hartigan knocks him out. Hartigan, fighting pain from a bad heart, heads into the warehouse where Roark Junior is holding Nancy. After defeating his accomplices, Hartigan confronts Junior and shoots off his ear, hand and genitals. Bob, now recovered, arrives and shoots Hartigan in the back. As the sirens approach, Bob leaves and Nancy lies down in Hartigan's lap. Hartigan passes out, reasoning his death is a fair trade for the girl's life. After a one-night stand with a woman named Goldie, Marv awakens to find she has been killed while he slept. He flees the frame-up as the police arrive, vowing to avenge her death. His parole officer, Lucille, advises him to give up, for Marv may have imagined it all due to his \"condition\". Marv interrogates several informants, working up to a corrupt priest, who reveals that the Roark family was behind the murder. Marv kills the priest. As he leaves, Marv is attacked by a woman who looks like Goldie, which he dismisses as a hallucination. Marv goes to the Roark family farm and is subdued by the silent stalker who killed Goldie. He awakens in the basement to find Lucille has been captured after looking into his story. She tells Marv that the killer is a cannibal named Kevin and that Goldie was a prostitute. They escape the basement, but Lucille is shot by a squad of corrupt cops. Marv kills the cops except for their leader, who reveals Cardinal Patrick Henry Roark arranged for Goldie's murder. Marv goes to Old Town, Sin City's prostitute-run red-light district, to learn more about Goldie and is captured by her twin sister, Wendy. Once he convinces Wendy that he is not the killer, the two return to the farm where Marv traps and kills Kevin. He confronts Cardinal Roark, who confesses his part in the murders. Kevin was the cardinal's ward; the two men ate the prostitutes to \"consume their souls\". Marv kills the cardinal. He is then shot and captured by his guards. Marv is nursed back to health. Corrupt cops threaten to kill his mother to get him to confess to killing Roark, Kevin and their victims. He is sentenced to death in the electric chair. Wendy visits him on death row and thanks him for avenging her sister. Marv is then executed. Shellie is being harassed by her abusive ex-boyfriend Jackie Boy. Her boyfriend Dwight McCarthy violently warns him to leave Shellie alone. Jackie Boy and his cronies drunkenly drive to Old Town. Dwight follows and sees them harass Becky, a young prostitute. Gail, the prostitutes' leader and Dwight's on-and-off lover, also witnesses the scene. When Jackie Boy threatens Becky with a gun, Miho, a martial arts expert, kills Jackie Boy and his friends. They realize Jackie Boy is actually Detective Lieutenant Jack Rafferty of the Basin City Police, considered a \"hero cop\" by the press. If the cops learn how he died, their truce with the prostitutes would end and the mob would be free to wage war on Old Town. Dwight takes the bodies to a tar pit, where he is ambushed by an ex-IRA mercenary hired by mob boss Wallenquist. He nearly drowns in the tar before Miho saves him. The mercenary flees to the sewer with Jackie Boy's severed head but Dwight and Miho retrieve it and return to Old Town. Meanwhile, mob enforcer Manute kidnaps Gail. Becky, threatened with the death of her mother, betrays the prostitutes. Manute prepares the mob's invasion of Old Town. Dwight trades Jackie Boy's head for Gail's freedom but the head is stuffed with explosives; Dwight detonates it, destroying the evidence and Gail's captors. The other prostitutes gun down the mercenaries while Becky, injured in the fight, escapes. Hartigan is recovering in a hospital when Senator Roark informs him that Junior is in a coma and the Roark legacy is in serious jeopardy. Hartigan will be framed for Junior's crimes; if he tells anyone the truth, his family will die. A grateful Nancy promises to write to him every week. Hartigan goes to jail, though he refuses to confess. He receives weekly letters from Nancy, as promised. After eight years, the letters stop and he receives a severed finger instead. Hartigan confesses to all charges, leading to his parole. He searches for an adult Nancy, not knowing he is being followed by a deformed, yellow man. He eventually finds her at Kadie's Bar, where she has become an exotic dancer. Hartigan realizes he was set up to lead \"them\" to Nancy and the two drive away in her car, followed by the deformed man. As they hide in a motel, Nancy confesses her love for Hartigan, who is unable to reciprocate her feelings. The deformed man ambushes Hartigan and reveals himself as Roark Junior, disfigured by years of treatment to regenerate his body parts. Junior hangs Hartigan and takes Nancy away. Hartigan escapes and tracks down Junior to the Roark farm. He fakes a heart attack, causing Junior to lower his guard. He castrates Junior a second time and brutally beats him to death. He sends Nancy away in her car, promising to join her soon. Knowing that Senator Roark will never stop hunting them, Hartigan commits suicide to ensure Nancy's safety. An injured Becky departs from a hospital, talking on a cell phone with her mother. In the elevator she encounters The Salesman, dressed as a doctor. He offers her a cigarette, calling her by name, and she abruptly ends the call with her mother.",

Unsure of his own emotional preparedness in rekindling the relationship, he decides to watch a play while waiting for her to complete her work shift, delaying the decision to meet her later in the evening. The final words of anguish in the play, uttered by a desperately ill child unable to be comforted by his mother, would later be echoed by Sangwon from the rooftop of his parents' apartment after his own failed act of despair. In the film's corollary chapter, Tongsu, a struggling, rootless, and inscrutable filmmaker who has become obsessed with a short film directed by his former classmate - and in particular, the devoted and obliging woman in the film - encounters the young actress in person and begins to ingratiate himself into her company, acting out his projected image of her by imitating gestures and revisiting locations from the film in an attempt to realize his own created image of her.",

    "Synopsis": "Melquiades Estrada, a Mexican illegal immigrant working in Texas as a cowboy, shoots at a coyote which is menacing his small flock of goats. A nearby United States Border Patrol officer, Mike Norton, thinks he is being attacked and shoots, killing Melquiades. Norton buries Melquiades and does not report anything about the event. Melquiades' body is found and is reburied in a local cemetery by the sheriff's office. Evidence that he may have been killed by Border Patrol is ignored by the local sheriff, Frank Belmont. Pete Perkins, a rancher and Melquiades' best friend, finds out from a waitress, Rachel, that the killer was Norton. Perkins had promised Melquiades that he would bury him in his home town of Jiménez, if he died in Texas. Perkins ties up Norton's wife, Lou Ann, kidnaps him and forces him to dig up Melquiades' body. Then he begins a journey on horseback into Mexico with the body tied to a mule and his captive Norton in tow. Sheriff Belmont realizes that Perkins has kidnapped Norton, and so police officers and the Border Patrol begin to search for them. Belmont sees them heading towards the Mexico border, but as he takes aim at Perkins, he can't bring himself to shoot, and he returns to town, leaving the pursuit to the Border Patrol. On their way across the harsh countryside, the pair experience a series of surrealistic encounters. They spend an afternoon with an elderly blind American, who listens to Mexican radio for company. The man asks to be shot since there is no one left to take care of him. He does not want to commit suicide because, he argues, doing so would offend God. Perkins refuses as that too would offend God. Norton attempts to escape and is bitten by a rattlesnake. They are eventually discovered by a group of illegal immigrants crossing into Texas. Perkins gives one of them a horse as barter payment for guiding them across the river to a herbal healer. She turns out to be a woman whose nose Norton had broken when he punched her in the face during an arrest. At Perkins's request, she saves Norton's life and then breaks Norton's nose with a coffee pot. The duo encounter a group of Mexican cowboys watching American soap operas on a television hooked up to their pickup truck. The program is the same episode that was airing when Norton had sex with his wife in their trailer earlier in the movie. Norton is visibly shaken and is given half a bottle of liquor by one of the cowboys. We see Norton's wife as she decides to leave the border town to return to her home town of Cincinnati. She has grown distant from her husband and seems unconcerned about his kidnapping, stating that he is \"beyond redemption\". Perkins and Norton arrive at a town that is near the location of Jiménez, but no one in the town has heard of it. Perkins has some luck in locating a woman Melquiades described as his wife but, when Perkins confronts her, she states that she has never heard of Melquiades Estrada and lives in town with her husband and children. She does visibly react to a photograph Perkins shows her of Melquiades standing behind her and her children, stating that she does \"...not want to get in trouble with her husband\". Perkins continues onward searching for Melquiades' descriptions of a place \"filled with beauty\". Eventually they come upon a ruined house which Perkins feels was the one Melquiades had mentioned. Perkins and Norton repair the walls, construct a new roof and bury Melquiades for the third and final time. Perkins then demands that Norton beg forgiveness for the killing, but Norton responds with obstinacy. Perkins fires several shots from his pistol around Norton until he complies, asking for forgiveness from Melquiades. Perkins accepts his hysterical grief and in passing calls him \"son\". Leaving Norton the second horse, Perkins rides away as Norton calls out and asking if he will be okay.",

    "Synopsis": "(Chinese: 戀愛夢; pinyin: liàn ài mèng) Set in Kaohsiung in 1966 (the year of the Cultural Revolution in mainland China and consequently a time of great freedom in Taiwan) with dialogue in Taiwanese Hokkien, the first story follows a young soldier, Chen, who is awaiting deployment to his station, and his encounter with a young woman, May, who works in a poolhall. Chen and May meet while playing pool together and often exchange glances while trying to remain discreet about their mutual attraction. As May begins to close the hall for the night, Chen promises to write to her before departing and she is flattered. Three months later, May receives a letter from Chen in which he writes that he hopes to see her soon. After working at the poolhall for a few months, she decides to return to Chiayi, where she had previously worked. One day, while off duty, Chen gets a chance to visit the Kaohsiung poolhall only to discover that May no longer works there. He begins to follow her trail, finally tracking her down at a different pool hall in Huwei. They spend some time together before heading to the train station so that he may return to his post, but arrive too late, missing the departure. She suggests they wait for the next bus and as they stand at the stop, he takes her hand and they huddle together underneath their umbrella. (Chinese: 自由夢; pinyin: zì yóu mèng) Set in Dadaocheng in 1911 (when Taiwan was occupied by the Japanese), with dialogue presented only through on-screen titles (as in a silent film), the second segment follows a singing courtesan living in a brothel who wants to be freed by becoming a concubine to Mr. Chang, a customer whose occupation as a traveling writer and political freedom fighter keeps him away for months at a time. When he visits her, he often shares stories of his travels and she sings to him (the only times we hear a voice during the segment). Despite being fond of her, he denies her the opportunity of freedom because he disagrees with the system of concubinage and is overcommitted to the political cause of fighting the Japanese through diplomacy. When her younger sister, Ah Mei, who also works as a courtesan, is impregnated by a customer who can't afford to buy her out, Mr. Chang decides to help buy the younger sister's freedom. After being bought, Ah Mei goes to speak with her sister and they say their farewells. One month later, Mr. Chang returns to the brothel to visit the courtesan. She tells him that she has been asked by her Madame to remain until Ah Mei's position is replaced and hopefully glances at him. Mr. Chang doesn't respond. A few days later, the new courtesan is brought in and speaks with her. She asks her age; the girl says she is ten. After Ah Mei comes to visit, the courtesan asks Mr. Chang if he has any plans to make her his concubine. He remains silent and she begins to cry. Three months later, the courtesan listens to the new girl's singing lessons when she receives a letter from Mr. Chang. In it, he writes of a poem that reflects on the sorrow that may befall Taiwan after being liberated by its captors. After reading the poem, the courtesan wipes her tears away. (Chinese: 青春夢; pinyin: qīng chūn mèng) Set in Taipei in 2005, with dialogue in Mandarin, the third segment begins with Jing, an epileptic club singer in a lesbian relationship, who has a sexual encounter with a photographer, Zhen, in her apartment and begins an affair. During one of her performances, he comes onstage to photograph her up close, prompting other photographers to follow suit, all while her girlfriend watches from the crowd. After Jing begins to interact with Zhen on stage, his girlfriend (presumably) walks out on the performance. Back at his apartment, Zhen finds Jing's badge with instructions on what to do in case of an epileptic episode. Before he goes to return it, he spots his girlfriend down the street and tries to embrace her, but she rejects his advances. Later, at a club, Jing and her girlfriend argue over Jing's failure to respond to her calls. Jing calms her down with a hug and promises to wait for her to perform. After they arrive at their apartment, Jing receives a text from Zhen to meet the following day so he can give her the photos as well as her misplaced badge. Jing's girlfriend tries to speak with her, but she remains distant. When her girlfriend leaves to bathe, Jing starts writing lyrics inspired by her experience with Zhen. The following morning, Jing works on recording the music to the song she wrote the night before. She meets up with Zhen and asks him to take her to his place, where they continue their affair. Back at the apartment, Jing's girlfriend wakes up to find Jing absent. After finding Jing's phone left behind, she types Jing a message in which she writes that she's tired of waiting to be loved back and that she'll kill herself like Jing's previous girlfriend. Jing returns home and finds the message. She reads it and lies down on the bed. The song she wrote begins to play. We see her riding with Zhen on his motorbike along the freeway.",

    "film_title": "Where the Truth Lies",
    "Synopsis": "In 1957, immediately after co-hosting a 39-hour polio telethon in Miami, entertainers Lanny Morris and Vince Collins fly north to open the new showroom of a New Jersey hotel run by mobster Sally Sanmarco, who has intimidated them into appearing. In their hotel suite, the nude body of Miami college student Maureen O'Flaherty is found in a bathtub. Maureen, an aspiring journalist working for the summer at the duo's Miami hotel (also owned by Sanmarco), had interviewed them in Miami for her college newspaper just before she disappeared. Police investigators did not connect Morris or Collins to Maureen's death, officially attributed to a drug overdose. Soon after, the two men's comedy partnership is dissolved, despite their success and dependence on one another. Many unanswered questions remain around Maureen's death; the most confusing aspect is how she got from Miami where she was last seen to New Jersey where her her body was found. Fifteen years later, journalist Karen O'Connor, who as a young polio survivor first met the duo at the 1957 telethon and has since idolized them, accepts a job to ghostwrite Collins' autobiography — a deal from which he will earn $1 million. Karen makes a promise to Maureen's mother that she will find the truth of how her daughter died. The project is complicated by Karen receiving anonymously sent chapters from a book Morris is writing. Karen encounters Morris by chance on a Pan Am flight to New York; he is accompanied by his valet, Reuben, and manager, Irv. During the flight she shares a dinner table with them. Wishing to keep her identity secret, she introduces herself as \"Bonnie Trout,\" the name of her best friend with whom she has traded apartments. Morris and Karen hit it off and have sex in his hotel. He disappears the next morning, apparently without leaving her a note. Under her own name, Karen begins to work on the Collins book. Complications arise when Collins invites her to an all-day working session at his Los Angeles home and she learns that Morris will be joining them as well. She abruptly invents an excuse to leave, but meets Morris in the driveway, and her masquerade is revealed — Morris learns she has lied about who she is, and Collins discovers that the woman helping him write his memoirs has had an affair with his ex-partner. Collins agrees to continue with the book, but creates a situation to blackmail Karen into staying away from the story of Maureen O'Flaherty, which is Karen's consuming interest. After plying Karen with wine and drugs, Collins manipulates her into having sex with a young singer. He photographs the two women in compromising positions. He then presses Karen to tell the publisher that there is nothing odd or improper surrounding Maureen's death, or he will make the pictures public. Gradually, it becomes clear what really happened that night 15 years before: the entertainers and the girl had engaged in a ménage à trois fueled by drugs and booze, and Collins tried to have sex with Morris, who resisted violently. Collins retreated to his room in shame, whereupon Maureen tried to blackmail Morris into paying to keep this a secret, and then fell asleep on the couch. In the morning, she was dead. Fifteen years later, Karen has begun to uncover the story when Morris's \"fix-it man,\" Reuben, approaches her. While both Morris and Collins were convinced the other murdered Maureen, they smuggled her body out of Miami with Reuben's assistance in a crate full of lobsters (a gift from Sanmarco), shipping it ahead of them to the New Jersey hotel. Reuben tells her that Maureen had turned her tape recorder on again after her interview, to record her interactions with Morris and Collins. Reuben offers to produce the tape, but only if Karen's publishing company is willing to pay him $1 million. Karen realizes that Reuben had been blackmailing Collins, demanding money to keep quiet about his homosexuality and his involvement in Maureen's death. Distraught, Collins commits suicide. Karen returns to Mrs. O'Flaherty but decides to publish her findings once the woman died, sparing her the pain of knowing the details of her daughter's behavior that contributed to the murder.",

    "film_title": "Babel (film)",
    "Synopsis": "Babel contains four main storylines with seemingly unconnected characters. The stories are not told in linear or chronological order. As the movie unfolds, the audience learns how each plot is intertwined with the others. In a desert in Morocco, Abdullah, a goatherder, buys a gun from his neighbor to shoot the jackals that have been preying on his goats. Abdullah gives the rifle to his two young sons, Yussef and Ahmed, and sends them out to tend to the herd. Doubtful of the rifle's purported range, the two decide to test it out, aiming at rocks and highway traffic. Yussef manages to hit a bus, critically wounding an American woman who is traveling with her husband on vacation. The two boys flee the scene and hide the rifle in the hills. Glimpses of television news programs reveal that the US government considers the shooting a terrorist act and is pressuring the Moroccan government to apprehend the culprits. Abdullah, who has heard about the shooting, asks the boys where the rifle is and beats the truth out of them. Finally, the three try to flee but are spotted. The police corner the father and boys on the rocky slope of a hill and open fire. After Ahmed is hit in the leg, Yussef returns fire, striking one police officer in the shoulder. The police continue shooting, hitting Ahmed in the back, severely injuring him. Yussef then surrenders, admitting responsibility for shooting the American and asking for medical assistance; the police are shocked to realize they were shooting at children. Richard and Susan are an American couple who came on vacation to Morocco. Their infant son Sam recently died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, putting a strain on their relationship. When Susan is shot on a tour bus, Richard orders the bus driver to the nearest village, Tazarine. The other tourists wait for some time, but they eventually demand to leave, fearing the heat and that they may be the target of further attacks. Richard tells the tour group to wait for the ambulance, which never arrives, and eventually the bus leaves without them. The couple stays behind with the bus's tour guide, still waiting for transport to a hospital. A helicopter arrives and carries Richard and Susan to a hospital in Casablanca, where she is expected to recover. Richard and Susan's Mexican nanny, Amelia, tends to their children, Debbie and Mike, in their San Diego, California home. When Amelia learns of Susan's injury, she worries that she will miss her son's wedding. Unable to secure any other help, she calls Richard, who tells her to stay with the children. Without his permission, Amelia decides to take them with her to the wedding in a rural community near Tijuana, Mexico. Rather than staying the night at the party, Amelia drives back to the States with her nephew, Santiago. He has been drinking heavily and the border guards become suspicious of him and the American children in the car. Amelia has passports for all of them, but no letter of consent from the children's parents allowing her to take them out of the United States. Under pressure, Santiago speeds away in a drunken panic and abandons Amelia and the children in the desert, whereupon awakening in the morning they soon begin to suffer from heat exhaustion. Amelia leaves the children behind to find help, ordering them not to move. She eventually finds a Border Patrol officer, who places her under arrest. They travel back to where she left the children, but they are not there. Amelia is taken back to a Border Patrol station, where she is eventually informed that the children have been found and that Richard, while outraged, has agreed not to press charges. However, she will be deported from the US where she has been working illegally. At the border, a tearful Amelia is greeted by her newlywed son. Chieko Wataya (綿谷 千恵子 Wataya Chieko) is a rebellious teenage girl who is deaf and non-verbal. She is also self-conscious and unhappy because of her deafness. While out with friends, she finds a teenage boy attractive, and following an unsuccessful attempt at socializing, exposes herself to him under a table. At a dental appointment, she tries to kiss the dentist, who sends her away. Chieko encounters two police detectives who question her about her father, Yasujiro. She invites one of the detectives, Kenji Mamiya (真宮 賢治 Mamiya Kenji), back to the high-rise apartment that she shares with her father. Incorrectly assuming that the detectives are investigating her father's involvement in her mother's suicide, she explains to Mamiya that her father was asleep when her mother jumped off the balcony and that she witnessed this herself. The detectives are actually investigating a hunting trip Yasujiro took in Morocco. Soon after learning this, Chieko approaches Mamiya nude and attempts to seduce him. He resists her approaches but comforts her as she bursts into tears. Leaving the apartment, Mamiya crosses paths with Yasujiro and questions him about the rifle. Yasujiro explains that there was no black market involvement; he gave his rifle as a gift to Hassan, his hunting guide on a trip in Morocco. About to depart, Mamiya offers condolences for the wife's suicide. Yasujiro, however, is confused by the mention of a balcony and angrily replies that his wife shot herself, and that Chieko was the first to discover her. As Mamiya sits in a restaurant, watching news of Susan's recovery, Yasujiro comforts his daughter with a hug as she stands at their balcony in mourning.",

    "Synopsis": "On 23 November 1977, during Argentina's last civil-military dictatorship, Claudio Tamburrini (Rodrigo de la Serna), a goalie for a minor league soccer team in Buenos Aires, is abducted by members of the Argentine secret military police. He is taken to a detention center known as Mansión Seré: an old dilapidated house in the suburban neighborhood of Morón on the suspicion he is a guerrilla man who opposes the dictatorship. Blindfolded, Tamburrini is tortured daily by his jailers, who demand information he does not have because he is not a political activist and never was. Tamburrini discovers an acquaintance nicknamed El Tano, whom he has met twice in his life, has lied under torture and falsely implicated him, claiming he has a mimeograph. On New Year's Eve, Huguito, the lead captor, teases Tamburrini by implying he is about to be released. Instead, he is taken to another room with more men. When Huguito insists Tamburrini remove his blindfold and look at him, Tamburrini understands he will never be released alive. He attacks Tano, who really is a member of a radical group. Tano claims he had no choice but to implicate Tamburrini after his name was discovered in Tano's address book. He insists that since Tamburrini is really innocent, he will be released eventually, but Tamburrini knows better. A new captive, Guillermo (Nazareno Casero), arrives and admits that he was really the one with the mimeograph, which he used to make fake papers for Tano. Tamburrini hopes that now he will be released, but Guillermo tells him that to have any chance of saving himself, he will have to implicate someone else, which Tamburrini refuses to do. Tano and a dozen other captives are told they are being transferred to prison but in reality are drugged and handed over to the Argentine Air Force, presumably being executed on a death flight. Tamburrini expects to be killed by the ruthless guards at any time. After four months of imprisonment, and many sessions of torture, Tamburrini and his fellow captives Guillermo, Vasco and Gallego dive out a window during a thunderstorm. The four, naked and with nothing but their senses, begin a desperate flight to freedom. After a night hiding in the suburbs, the four men get ahold of some money and clothes and part ways; three of them leave the country, including Tamburrini, whom years later writes the book in which the film is based on.",

The couple go their separate ways and Bahar tells him not to call. As fall follows summer, back in Istanbul, İsa makes contact again with a woman, Serap, with whom he cheated on Bahar before and who is in a relationship with an acquaintance of his.

    "Synopsis": "The film opens with a shot of a doorway in a run-down neighborhood. Furniture comes crashing down on the pavement from a second-floor window, followed by a close shot of a woman holding a knife and ranting. As in other parts of the movie, relationships of time and space between shots are not clear. It is not certain that the woman was the one throwing out the furniture or that the man she is complaining about is Ventura, the 75-year-old main character. (Like most of the film's other characters, Ventura is played by a nonprofessional.) Much of the film is taken up with Ventura's visits to other people in the area, many of whom he refers to as his \"children.\" Sometimes in return, they refer to him as \"Papa.\" At other times, Ventura is shown in his new, bright but almost barren, government-provided apartment, which contrasts sharply with the squalid and dark tenements that are due to be destroyed. Those rooms are often filmed in a high-contrast style that makes them strangely beautiful. Ventura is asked to write a love letter by a fellow Cape Verdean (Lento) for his wife. Ventura's recitation of the letter becomes a recurring theme in the film. At times in the film, there are also allusions to past lives in the Cape Verde Islands and to Portugal's political past, the title \"Youth on the March\" being especially ironic.",

    "Synopsis": "In French North Africa in 1943 large numbers of men from France's overseas possessions have been recruited into the French First Army of the Free French Forces to fight alongside the other Allies against Nazi Germany and liberate France from occupation. The army consists mainly of pieds-noirs, soldiers of mostly European descent, and indigènes of African descent, including Algerians, Moroccans (known as goumiers), and troops from Sub-Sahara Africa (known as Senegalese Tirailleurs). Saïd, an impoverished goat herder, joins the 7th Algerian Tirailleurs Regiment wiih other Algerians including Messaoud, who wants to marry and settle in France, and the literate Corporal Abdelkader, who seeks equality for the indigenous Algerians. Two Moroccans also join, and Yassir's aim is to gain enough war booty so his brother Larbi can afford to marry. The men train in lend-lease American uniforms under Sergeant Martinez, a battle-hardened pied-noir. They deploy to Italy where their first mission is to capture a heavily-defended mountain. Their French commanding officer is using them as cannon fodder to identify artillery targets and the colonial troops suffer heavy casualties. The colonel tells a French war correspondent \"today was a great victory for the Free French Forces\". The regiment is embarked for Operation Dragoon to liberate southern France. When a French cook refuses to give tomatoes to indigènes soldiers, mutiny is narrowly averted by Martinez and the company captain. Arriving in Marseille, the colonial troops are greeted as heroes. Messaoud meets and courts Irène, a French woman, promising to write and return to her. She promises to wait for him so they can marry. When Saïd becomes Martinez's orderly, the other soldiers call him \"girlie\" and tease him with accusations he's gay. When he snaps and threatens Messaoud at knifepoint, Abdelkader intervenes. Saïd relents, but expresses frustration with their segregated world. Saïd drinks with Martinez, and comments on his family photograph that reveals both men have an Arab mother. Martinez threatens to kill him if he reveals that secret. The colonial troops are denied leave while others in the Free French Forces are allowed furloughs. The colonials are herded into billets and given a ballet performance for entertainment. Bored and disillusioned, they gather outside to discuss the injustice and a fight starts. French military police bring Messaoud to a temporary stockade where Abdelkader, one of the instigators, is also being held. Messaoud was arrested trying to find Irène in Marseille. Abdelkader is brought before the French colonel who orders him on a special mission to take ammunition to American troops fighting in the Lorraine Campaign where French troops will liberate Alsace. He promises the colonial soldiers will be rewarded if successful. As they cross the German lines, most of the men are killed by a booby trap, including Yassir's brother, and Martinez is severely injured. The survivors are eager to retreat but Abdelkader rallies them and they reach an Alsatian village where they ingratiate themselves with the locals. The arrival of Germans instigates a battle. Messaoud is badly hurt by a Panzerschreck rocket and shot by a German rifleman. Saïd attempts to evacuate Martinez, but both are fatally wounded. Yassir is shot attempting to flee and just as Abdelkader is cornered, colonial reinforcements arrive and drive the Germans out of the village. As columns of Free French forces move through, Abdelkader sees the colonel passing in his jeep, but the commanding officer ignores him. A staff officer asks where his unit is. When Abdelkader says they are all dead, he is assigned to another French NCO. He passes a film cameraman filming only white French troops standing by the liberated villagers. The villagers, however, applaud Abdelkader as he leaves. The story flashes forward to the present, and an elderly Abdelkader visiting a war cemetery in Alsace to visit the graves of his comrades Martinez, Larbi, Saïd, Yassir and Messaoud. He returns to his small rundown flat in France. The film concludes with a title indicating that in 1959 war pensions for French colonial veterans living in France received no increases once their country of origin gained independence.",

    "Synopsis": "Don Anderson is the Mickey's hamburger chain marketing director who helped develop the \"Big One,\" its most popular menu item. When he learns that independent research has discovered a considerable presence of fecal matter in the meat, he travels to the fictitious town of Cody, Colorado to determine if the local Uni-Globe meatpacking processing plant, Mickey's main meat supplier, is guilty of sloppy production. Don's tour shows him only the pristine work areas and most efficient procedures, assuring him that everything the company produces is immaculate. Suspicious of the façade he's been shown, Don meets rancher Rudy Martin, who used to supply cattle to the Uni-Globe plant. Rudy and his Chicana housekeeper both assure him that because of the plant's production level, several safety regulations are ignored or worked against; workers have no time to make sure that the manure coming from the intestines stays away from the meat. Don later meets with Harry Rydell, executive VP of Mickey's, who admits being aware of the issue, but is not concerned. Amber is a young, upbeat employee of Mickey's, studying for college and living with her mother Cindy. While her life seems to be set, she continually faces the contrast between her current career and her own ambition, emphasized by her two lazy co-workers, Brian and Andrew, who, having heard of armed robberies at fast food restaurants in the area, start planning their own. Amber and Cindy are visited by Cindy's brother Pete, who encourages Amber to leave town and start a real career. Amber eventually meets a group of young activists, Andrew, Alice, and Paco, who plan to liberate cattle from Uni-Globe as their first act of rebellion. They proceed to sneak up to a holding pen at the plant, but after breaking down the fence, they are shocked that the cattle make no attempt to leave. Upon hearing the police, they retreat and contemplate why the cattle decided to stay in confinement. Raúl, his love interest Sylvia, and Sylvia's sister Coco are illegal immigrants from Mexico, trying to make it in Colorado. They all go to Uni-Globe in hopes of finding a job – Raúl becomes a cleaner, while Coco works on a meat processing conveyor belt. Sylvia, however, cannot take the environment, and instead finds a job as a hotel maid. Coco develops a drug habit, and begins an affair with her exploitative superior, Mike. In a work accident, a friend of Raúl's falls in a machine, and his leg is mangled. Raúl, attempting to save him, falls and is injured. At the hospital, Sylvia is told that Raúl was on amphetamines at work. Because Raúl is now unable to work, Sylvia has sex with Mike in order to find a job at Uni-Globe. She ends up working on the \"kill floor.” As she makes her way through the floor, she sees multiple cows being slaughtered and butchered. Realizing that this is her life now, Sylvia breaks down in tears as she begins her new job.",

Resenting André's lack of affection, she picks up Blondel in a bar where they are drinking and has noisy sex outside in his car. Both men are called up to fight in a Middle Eastern country, leaving Barbe pregnant. André and Blondel's platoon go on a long patrol in the bare mountains, shooting men and children and raping a woman. They are captured by insurgents, who emasculate the rapist before shooting him and execute most of the rest.

    "Synopsis": "Koistinen is a lonely nightwatchman tasked with guarding a shopping mall. He attempts to socialize, but is treated coldly by his manager and subjected to mocking by his colleagues. While drinking alone in a bar, he catches the eye of some criminals headed by Lindholm who learn of his occupation. Koistinen's only human contact is the grill vendor Aila to whom he outlines his plans of starting his own company. While at work, Koistinen notices a dog left outside a pub without water. While he is taking a break, Mirja approaches him, saying he seems lonely. They agree to go on a date together. Returning from his break, Koistinen meets a young boy in front of the pub and asks if he knows the owners of the dog. Despite the boy's warning, Koistinen confronts the owners in the pub and is beaten. Koistinen and Mirja go on a date. They talk little, and at a concert Koistinen watches as Mirja goes dancing on her own with other men. Despite this, they agree to meet again. Koistinen returns to Aila's grill and talks about his evening. Insulted, Aila asks him to leave and closes shop. Meanwhile, Mirja meets with Lindholm for her payment and ridicules Koistinen. Lindholm informs his contacts of an \"open-door day.\" Koistinen seeks a loan to start his own business, but is harshly refused at the bank due to his insufficient education and lack of guarantors. Later, Mirja unexpectedly joins Koistinen while he is taking his rounds. While Koistinen explains the mall's security system, Mirja memorizes the security code he uses. She gives the code to Lindholm, who tells her to start cooling the fake relationship off. Mirja meets Koistinen at his place, but abruptly leaves when he attempts to put his arm around her. Koistinen begins to drink heavily, and ends up at Aila's grill. Aila walks him home and puts him to bed. At work, one of Koistinen's colleagues mockingly asks about his successes with women. Koistinen grabs the man, but stops himself from striking him and goes to his rounds. Mirja meets him and asks him to come and talk. Koistinen signs off and leaves with Mirja in his car. Mirja drugs Koistinen and passes his keys to one of Lindholm's contacts. Using Koistinen's keys and security code, the thieves rob a jewellery store at the mall. The police question Koistinen, but he claims to have been alone and drunk. He is released due to lack of proof, but is fired from his job. On Lindholm's insistence, Mirja meets with Koistinen at his apartment once again to plant evidence. Koistinen notices her hiding the evidence, but does not stop her and lets himself be arrested by the police. He is sentenced to two years in prison. Koistinen initially remains lonely in prison, tearing up a letter Aila sends him. Just as Koistinen begins to have some contact to other inmates, he is released a year early on parole. He finds lodgings at a night shelter and gets a job as a restaurant's dishwasher. He runs into Aila, but soon excuses himself. However, Aila comes to see him at the night shelter and asks about his plans for the future. When Koistinen says he plans to open a garage once he's back on his feet, she congratulates him for not losing hope. They agree to see each other again. Koistinen sees Mirja and Lindholm at the restaurant where he is working, but does not confront them. Lindholm calls up the head waitress and tells about Koistinen's criminal record, which results in him being fired immediately. Koistinen gets a knife from the night shelter and returns to the restaurant. As Lindholm and Mirja are leaving, he attacks Lindholm, but only manages to cut his hand while being disarmed and subdued by Lindholm's thugs. The thugs offer to kill Koistinen, but Lindholm refuses, saying he is a businessman and not a murderer. The young boy who warned Koistinen earlier sees the thugs take him away and finds Aila. They discover the badly beaten Koistinen in the harbour, along with the dog Koistinen attempted to help earlier. Aila offers to get help but Koistinen asks her to stay. When she asks him not to die, Koistinen replies \"I won't die yet\" and puts his hand on hers.",

    "film_title": "Marie Antoinette (2006 film)",
    "Synopsis": "Fourteen-year-old Marie Antoinette, the daughter and youngest child of Holy Roman Empress Maria Theresa of Austria, is a beautiful, charming and naïve archduchess. In 1770, she is sent away in order to wed the future Louis XVI, the Dauphin of France, to seal an alliance between the two rival countries. Marie Antoinette travels to France, relinquishing all connections with her home country, and meets King Louis XV and her future husband, the Dauphin. The betrothed young couple arrive at the Palace of Versailles and are married at once. They are encouraged to produce an heir to the throne as soon as possible, but the next day it is reported to the king that \"nothing happened\" on the wedding night. As time passes, Marie Antoinette finds life at the court of Versailles stifling. Her husband's courtiers disdain her as a foreigner and blame her for not producing an heir, although the fault really lies with her husband, for the marriage remains unconsummated for an inordinate amount of time. The French court is rife with gossip, and Marie Antoinette consistently ruffles feathers by defying its ritualistic formality. She instead spends much of her time with the few friends she has in Versailles, including the conservative Princesse de Lamballe and the flamboyant Duchess of Polignac. Marie Antoinette also refuses to meet or speak with Madame du Barry, the mistress of Louis XV. Over the years, Maria Theresa continues to write to her daughter, giving advice on how to impress and seduce the Dauphin. Marie Antoinette's attempts to consummate her marriage with her husband fail and they remain childless. Marie spends most of her time buying extravagant clothes and gambling. After a masquerade ball, Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI return to find the king dying of smallpox; he orders du Barry to leave Versailles. After the king's death, Marie Antoinette's husband succeeds him as Louis XVI at the age of 19, and Marie Antoinette becomes queen consort at age 18. Marie Antoinette's brother, Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, comes to visit, counseling her against her constant parties, advice that she finds easy to ignore. Joseph meets Louis XVI at the Royal Zoo and explains to him the \"mechanics\" of sexual intercourse in terms of \"key-making\", as one of the king's favorite hobbies is locksmithing. Thereafter, Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette have sex for the first time, and in 1778, Marie Antoinette gives birth to a daughter, Marie Thérèse. As the child matures, Marie Antoinette spends much of her time at the Petit Trianon, a small chateau in the park of Versailles. It is also at this time that she begins an affair with Axel Fersen. As France's financial crisis worsens, food shortages and riots intensify, her public image deteriorates and her luxurious lifestyle and seeming indifference to the struggles of the French people earned her the name \"Madame Deficit\". As the queen matures, Marie Antoinette focuses less on her social life and more on her family and makes what she considers to be significant financial adjustments. Her mother dies in 1780, and the following year she gives birth to a son, Louis-Joseph, Dauphin of France. She gives birth to another son, Louis-Charles, in 1785, and another daughter, Sophie, in 1786, who dies a month before her first birthday. As the French Revolution erupts with the storming of the Bastille, the royal family resolves to stay in France, unlike most of the court. The angry people of France force them to leave Versailles for Paris. The film ends with the royal family's transfer to the Tuileries. The last image is Marie Antoinette's bedroom at Versailles, destroyed by angry rioters.",

    "Unnamed: 0": 1426,
    "year": 2006,
    "film_title": "Pan's Labyrinth",
    "Synopsis": "In a fairy tale, Princess Moanna, whose father is the king of the underworld, visits the human world, where the sunlight blinds her and erases her memory. She becomes mortal and eventually dies. The king believes that eventually her spirit will return to the underworld, so he builds labyrinths around the world which act as portals, in preparation for her return. In 1944 Francoist Spain, ten-year-old Ofelia travels with her pregnant mother Carmen to meet Captain Vidal, her new stepfather. Vidal, a Civil Guard officer of the Armed Police Corps and devotee of Falangism, has been assigned to hunt down the Spanish Maquis. A large stick insect, which Ofelia believes to be a fairy, leads Ofelia into an ancient stone labyrinth, but she is stopped by Vidal's housekeeper Mercedes, who is secretly supporting her brother Pedro and other members of the Maquis. That night, the insect appears in Ofelia's bedroom, where it transforms into a fairy and leads her through the labyrinth. There, she meets a faun, who believes she is the reincarnation of Princess Moanna. He gives her a book and tells her she will find in it three tasks to complete in order for her to acquire immortality and return to her kingdom. During a dinner with several important figures, Vidal announces that he will stockpile food and supplies in the granary in order to weaken the Maquis and their collaborators. The local population can only access supplies through ration cards. Vidal secures the granary with a thick padlock, to which Mercedes pretends to give him a unique copy of the key. Ofelia completes the first task — retrieving a key from the belly of a giant toad — but becomes worried about her mother, whose condition is worsening. The faun gives Ofelia a mandrake root, instructing her to keep it under Carmen's bed and regularly supply it with blood, which seems to ease Carmen's illness. Accompanied by three fairy guides and equipped with a piece of magic chalk, Ofelia then completes the second task — retrieving a dagger from the lair of the Pale Man, a child-eating monster. Despite the faun's warning not to consume anything there, she gives in to her temptation and eats two grapes, awakening the Pale Man. He devours two of the fairies and chases Ofelia, but she manages to escape. Infuriated at her disobedience, the faun refuses to give Ofelia the third task and abandons her. During this time, Ofelia becomes aware of Vidal's ruthlessness in the course of hunting down the Maquis. He interrogates and kills two local farmers (who only hunted rabbits). Days later, the Maquis launch an attack to distract Vidal and his men and steal supplies from the barn, using a second copy of the key Mercedes gave to Pedro. Upon returning to the barn, Vidal discovers that the lock has not been forced. Vidal interrogates and tortures a captive member of the Maquis, who turns out to be a stutterer and fails to escape unscathed when Vidal orders him to count to 3 without stuttering. He asks Doctor Ferreiro to tend to the captive, whom Ferreiro then euthanises at his own urging. Realising that Ferreiro is collaborating with the Maquis, Vidal kills him. He later catches Ofelia tending to the mandrake root, and considers her delusional for her belief in fairy tales. Carmen agrees and throws the root into the fire. She immediately develops painful contractions and dies giving birth to Vidal's son. Vidal grows suspicious of Mercedes, connecting her to the Maquis raid, due to the unharmed lock on the barn. A discovered spy, Mercedes tries to escape with Ofelia, but they are caught. Ofelia is locked in her bedroom, while Mercedes is taken to be interrogated since the stutterer had indirectly betrayed her before dying, as well as finding several stored provisions from the barn in his possession confirming Vidal's suspicions about Mercedes. Mercedes frees herself, and slashes Vidal’s face in her escape to re-join the Maquis. The faun, having changed his mind about giving Ofelia a chance to perform the third task, returns and tells her to bring her newborn brother into the labyrinth to complete it. Ofelia retrieves the baby and flees into the labyrinth. Vidal pursues her as the Maquis launch an attack on a Civil Guard outpost. Ofelia meets the faun at the centre of the labyrinth. The faun suggests drawing a small amount of the baby's blood, as completing the third task and opening the portal to the underworld requires the blood of an innocent, but Ofelia refuses to harm her brother. Vidal finds her talking to the faun, whom he cannot see. The faun leaves, and Vidal takes the baby from Ofelia's arms before shooting her. Vidal returns to the labyrinth's entrance, where he is surrounded by the Maquis, including Mercedes and Pedro. Knowing that he will be killed, he hands the baby to Mercedes, asking that his son be told the time of his father's death, wanting to smash his pocket watch the same way Vidal's father had done during the war. Mercedes replies that his son will not even know his name, before Pedro shoots Vidal dead. Mercedes enters the labyrinth and comforts a dying Ofelia. Drops of Ofelia's blood fall down the centre of the spiral stone staircase onto an altar. Ofelia, well dressed and uninjured, then appears in a golden throne room. The King of the underworld tells her that, by choosing to spill her own blood rather than that of another, she passed the final test. The faun praises Ofelia for her choice, addressing her as \"Your Highness\". The Queen of the underworld, her mother, invites Ofelia to sit next to her father and rule at his side. Back in the stone labyrinth, Ofelia smiles as she dies. The epilogue completes the tale of Princess Moanna, stating that she returned to the Underworld, ruled with kindness and justice for many centuries, and left little traces of her time in the human realm, \"visible only to those who know where to look.\"",

    "Synopsis": "Jackie Morrison works in Glasgow as a CCTV operator, monitoring the Red Road Flats. She lives alone and engages in occasional sex with married man Avery. Jackie recognises a man she sees on the CCTV monitor and begins inquiring about him. It is revealed that he is Clyde Henderson, a prisoner who has been released early for good behaviour, but who will be back in prison immediately if he steps out of line. She begins stalking Clyde, tracking him on the CCTV monitors and gathering information about him. She follows Clyde to a cafe, and later learns he is throwing a party at the apartment he shares with a fellow ex-con by the name of Stevie. She gains entry to the party and begins exchanging looks with a drunk Clyde. They dance, but she makes an excuse and runs out of the apartment. After spotting Clyde on CCTV heading to a local bar, she goes there and sees him break up a fight between Stevie and another man. Stevie and his girlfriend return to Clyde's apartment, while Clyde initiates a conversation with Jackie before inviting her back to the apartment too. Clyde reveals he has a daughter, with whom he regrets having lost contact. Clyde and Jackie have passionate sex, but she runs from the bedroom and then sets Clyde up for a rape charge, striking her face with a stone and fleeing from the apartment block in view of the CCTV cameras. The police identify Clyde as the rapist and Jackie watches the arrest on CCTV, and a few moments later sees Clyde's daughter approach the apartment block. Later, Stevie gains entry to Jackie's home and demands to know why she has falsely accused Clyde. Jackie reveals that Clyde had killed her husband and daughter in a car accident. Jackie relents and tells the police she wishes to withdraw the accusation of rape. After Clyde's release, Jackie confronts him and they argue: Clyde describes the road traffic accident that killed Jackie's husband and daughter, explaining that he lost control of the car. Jackie reveals that her last words to her daughter were harsh. She tells Clyde that his daughter tried to reach him on the day of his arrest, and they go their separate ways.",

    "Synopsis": "As narrated by Iraq War veteran Private Pilot Abilene, on July 4, 2005, El Paso and Abilene, Texas were destroyed and hundreds of thousands were killed by twin nuclear attacks, sending the United States into a state of a Third World War, with the government re-introducing the draft. The PATRIOT Act has extended authority, due to the overwhelming victory of the Republican Party, to a new agency known as US-IDENT, which keeps constant surveillance on citizens. In response to the recent fuel shortage in the wake of global warfare, the German company Treer designs a generator of inexhaustible energy, which is propelled by the perpetual motion of ocean currents, called \"Fluid Karma\", with Treer scientist Baron Von Westphalen seeking world domination using the leverage of his energy machine. In 2008 Los Angeles, Senator and GOP Vice-Presidential candidate Bobby Frost (who also seeks the presidency itself) presides over the opening of US-IDENT with his wife, Nana Mae Frost, installed as its director. Right-wing film star Boxer Santaros awakens on the beach with amnesia after a three-day disappearance. He does not remember his marriage to Senator Frost's daughter Madeline, and has instead begun an affair with former porn star turned-talk show host Krysta Now. Meanwhile, a group of Neo-Marxist revolutionaries composed of Cyndi Pinziki, Zora Carmichaels and Ronald Taverner hatch a plan to turn the national spotlight against US-IDENT. They have kidnapped Ronald's twin brother, police officer Roland, and plan to outfit Ronald in his uniform and car in order to stage a racially motivated double-murder. They have Boxer bring a video camera as he goes with Ronald, under the guise of preparing for a police officer role for his screenplay. Ronald responds to a staged domestic disturbance call where Neo-Marxists Dream and Dion, disguised as newlyweds, fake an argument. Unexpectedly, another cop, Bart Bookman arrives on the scene, murders Dream and Dion, and takes the camera. Bookman is revealed to be in cahoots with Zora when she later attacks Ronald with fluid karma, leaving him unconscious in the street. The next day, Krysta stops by Zora's apartment and takes the videotape of the double murder, mistaking it for her sex tape. At the Santa Monica beach, she puts it in a Neo-Marxist dropbox, leading to the contents later being made public, and Zora and Bookman are shot dead by police while attempting to steal back the tape. Boxer arrives at the beach and meets Starla, who called him earlier posing as a character from his screenplay, and threatens to kill herself if he doesn't allow her to perform oral sex on him. Private Abilene shoots her dead from his perch at the top of the pier and Boxer runs off, only to be confronted by supposed friend Fortunio, who knocks him unconscious and returns him to the Frosts. Nearby, Ronald awakens and sets out to find his brother. He encounters a young man named Martin Kefauver in an SUV and stops him from killing himself to avoid the draft, and the two go out in search for Roland, who earlier escaped the Neo-Marxist headquarters during a US-IDENT raid, only to be captured by Walter Mung, an ice cream truck-based arms dealer. The Frosts and the city prepare for an upper-class party on Von Westphalen's Mega-Zeppelin to celebrate its launch. Boxer leaves the main hall of the ship in search of answers, and finds a room with three of Westphalen's scientists, who explain that he was selected to travel through a time rift in the desert at the time of his disappearance, and is, in fact, his future self. The scientists show him the corpse of his past self, who they say killed himself. Boxer asserts that his suicide is impossible because he is a \"pimp\", and \"pimps don't commit suicide.\" One of the scientists also states that dire consequences would unfold if two identical human souls were to make physical contact. Boxer presses Serpentine for details, revealing that Boxer was actually murdered in a car bomb and that Roland was the one who kidnapped Boxer and drove him through the rift. She also confirms that Roland and Ronald are the same person, with his past and present self coexisting. Outside where the city is, as a firefight ensues between rioters and the police, both Taverners crash into each other. Roland is shot in the eye but survives. Inside the ice cream truck, the Taverners hold hands, causing the truck to rise into the air along with Kefauver, who stands on top with a shoulder-mounted heat-seeking ground-to-air missile. US-IDENT headquarters is raided by Fortunio and rioters who kill Nana Mae Frost. Inside the Zeppelin, Boxer returns to the main hall and takes the stage for a dance number involving Krysta and his wife, Madeline. He interrupts the number to order an evacuation, or else he will kill himself. Kefauver fires a rocket at the Zeppelin, destroying it, and jumps off the truck. As the Taverners continue to hold hands, a time rift begins to grow in the sky. Roland threatens Ronald with suicide if he does not let go and tells him to \"remember Fallujah\". Ronald replies that it was not their fault, with Roland conceding that it was friendly fire. Abilene narrates that a new age is beginning, with Roland as its Messiah, concluding that he is a \"pimp\" and that \"pimps don't commit suicide.\"",

    "film_title": "Summer Palace (2006 film)",
    "Synopsis": "Spanning several cities and over a decade, Summer Palace tells the story of Yu Hong (played by Hao Lei), a young woman from the border-city of Tumen, who is accepted to the fictional Beiqing University, a name that evokes both Peking University (\"Beida\") and Tsinghua University (\"Qinghua\"). While in school, Yu meets Li Ti, her best friend (played by Hu Lingling), and Zhou Wei, her college boyfriend and the love of her life (played by Guo Xiaodong). The film is divided into two parts. The first begins in the late 1980s (subtitles inform the audience of the place and year at various points in the film), as Yu Hong enters the university. Lonely and isolated despite the cramped living conditions, Yu Hong eventually befriends another student, Li Ti, who introduces her to her boyfriend Ruo Gu (played by Zhang Xianmin), and Ruo Gu's friend Zhou Wei. Yu Hong and Zhou Wei embark upon a passionate but volatile love affair just as political forces are moving towards Tiananmen Square. Two events then bring the first half of the film to a close: First, Zhou Wei, incensed at the jealousy and emotional instability of his girlfriend, begins to have an affair with Li Ti; and second, the crackdown occurs on the students on Tiananmen Square and on the campus of Beida. During all of this, Yu Hong's old boyfriend Xiao Jun (played by Cui Jin) from Tumen arrives and the two of them leave, Yu Hong deciding that she will drop out from the university. The film then fast forwards several years, as Lou Ye intersperses the travels of his three main characters with news footage of the end of the Cold War, and the 1997 Hong Kong handover. Yu Hong has left Tumen again, first for Shenzhen, and then for the central China city of Wuhan, while Li Ti and Ruo Gu have moved to Berlin. Yu Hong is unable to forget Zhou Wei, and has empty affairs with a married man and a kind but quiet mailroom worker. The film follows her disaffection with society and her use of sex as a substitute for contentment. Eventually discovering that she is pregnant, Yu Hong gets an abortion and moves to Chongqing where she marries. Li Ti, Ruo Gu, and Zhou Wei, meanwhile, live a quiet life as expatriates in Berlin. While Li Ti and Zhou Wei still occasionally make love, the former quietly realizes that the latter does not love her. Though the three friends appear happy, when Zhou Wei decided to return to China, Li Ti suddenly commits suicide. In Chongqing Zhou connects with former classmates who give him Yu Hong's email address. After more than ten years, Zhou and Yu at last reunite in the resort city of Beidaihe. While they embrace, they ask each other, \"Now what?\" When Yu leaves, ostensibly to buy drinks, Zhou understands that they can never be together and leaves as well.",

    "Synopsis": "Opening with a wedding between two young Communists, officiated by a CP functionary, under the poster of Mao-Tse Tung, the bride suddenly spears the man and escapes, chased by the police. This is the end of 'Cataratte'/'Cataracts', a 10-year-old action B-movie projected in an open-air cinema in honor of Bruno Bonomo (Silvio Orlando), a cockeyed film producer, who did some trash movies starring his wife Paola (Margherita Buy) in the 1970s. He also has two young sons loved by him and his wife. During this homage, a young woman presents him the script of a movie she wants to direct with his help. Slated to start on a project celebrating the return voyage of Columbus just after his discovery of America, Bruno is stunned when his director, Franco Caspio, quits because of the low budget. Suddenly Bruno has no projects, no financing and no leverage. Added to his many troubles, Bruno's wife asks for a separation even though they have two sons. She wants to pursue her artistic options. Bruno reads the offered script and realizes that it's a thinly disguised account of Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media magnate who promoted his political career through his TV stations. Knowing this could draw political and legal heat, not to mention difficulty for finding funding; but the young woman convinces Bruno to start production on The Caiman. The film shows how secret money, slush funds and Swiss bank accounts start Il Caimano's career as a big building developer. She hopes that the film will influence voters in the elections slated for 2006. Musing a love relationship with the writer, Bruno meets her lesbian partner and her son 'made' in a 'journey' to the Netherlands. The production of the film is rife with problems, including the defection of the main actor Marco Pulici (Michele Placido), but the plot of The Caiman also deals with the domestic issues between Bonomo and Paola until their final separation, with the compromises made for their two sons. Despite growing evidence that his film will never be completed, Bonomo decides to shoot the last scene, which shows the political nucleus behind the film: in it, Silvio Berlusconi (played by Nanni Moretti himself) enters the tribunal room to hear the ruling against him (see Legal investigations of Berlusconi), which sentences him to seven years of jail. Notwithstanding the sentence, Berlusconi/Moretti exits the tribunal while a crowd throws debris at the judges, including a Molotov cocktail. The whole, crude scene is not only an allusion to Berlusconi's judiciary controversies, but also to his powerful ability to communicate, which (in Moretti's view) led Italian people to support him anyway despite his controversial past.",

    "film_title": "The Family Friend",
    "Synopsis": "Geremia de’ Geremei, an aging tailor, lives in Sabaudia, in the Pontine Marshes, in a modest house with his bedridden elderly mother. He runs a small tailoring shop as a front for his real activity as a loan shark, like his father, who abandoned him when he was 9. Geremia is cynical and ruthless when it comes to ensuring respect, and attentive, in his own interest, to helping only those who will somehow be able to repay him. For his morbid and obsessive interest in his clients' problems, he is nicknamed Geremia “Cuoredoro“ (Heart-of-Gold) and becomes a “family friend“, introducing into his clients' lives till their debt is fully repaied. Amassing money is not his only passion; Geremia has a weakness for gianduiotto chocolates and an unhealthy, obsessive relationship with women. Supporting him in his work, in addition to two brawny twin brothers who act as his henchmen, is Gino, his faithful informer from Veneto with a passion for country music, who dresses like a cowboy and lives in a camper van, and who dreams of one day moving to Tennessee after losing his fiancée in a car crash years ago. Among his clients, a father, Saverio, steps forward who does not have the means to contribute to the expenses for his daughter’s wedding. Geremia “takes the case to heart” when he sees the bride-to-be, an impertinent beauty queen named Rosalba. The girl does not concern herself with financial problems, nor does she in fact have any particular demands regarding the wedding. However, when she realises the reason why this \"family friend,\" of whose existence she was unaware, has suddenly appeared in their home, she flies into a rage. Her father then explains to her that the family’s resources are practically nonexistent, and that in order to make the imminent wedding at least dignified, he must submit to yet another humiliation, after the many already endured precisely so that she could be raised in comfort. Thus, on the very morning of the wedding, under the pretext of a repair to her dress, the loan shark visits the young woman, who gives herself to him in exchange for a drastic reduction in the usury rate. Geremia is subsequently approached with a very tempting proposal. An industrialist with credit problems, Giulio Montanaro, is about to close a sensational deal but immediately needs one million euros. He would even be able to repay double the amount in a very short time. Accustomed to small loans, always excessively guaranteed, “Heart-of-Gold” surprisingly ends up accepting, despite the fact that he has been advised against it by Gino and, above all, by his mother. Contributing to his bite being bigger than he can chew is also the euphoric state that follows his renewed encounter with the young newlywed who, when he sees her again after some time, first rejects his advances and then unexpectedly offers herself to him, declaring that she is in love. Once the deal is done, the greedy loan shark opens his eyes: Gino, his thugs, and the girl have deceived him, setting up the entire affair by hiring a few small-time actors, and now they have disappeared. With the death of his mother and the loss of all his possessions, Geremia is now even more alone in the world. In the last scene, Geremia is seen searching valuables with a metal detector in the beach of Sabaudia, suggesting that he will start to amass money again.",

    "Synopsis": "In County Cork in Ireland, in 1920, Damien O'Donovan is about to leave his native village to practice medicine in a London hospital. Meanwhile, his brother Teddy commands the local flying column of the Irish Republican Army. After a hurling match, Damien witnesses the summary execution of his friend Micheál Ó Súilleabháin, by British Black and Tans, for refusing to say his name in English and punching an officer. Although shaken, Damien rebuffs his friends' entreaties to stay in Ireland and join the IRA, saying that the war is unwinnable. As he is leaving town, Damien witnesses the British Army vainly trying to intimidate a railway employee for refusing to permit the troops to board. In response, Damien decides to stay and is sworn into Teddy's IRA brigade. After drilling in the mountains, the column raids the village's Royal Irish Constabulary barracks to acquire more arms, then uses them to assassinate four Auxiliaries. In the aftermath, Anglo-Irish landowner Sir John Hamilton coerces one of his servants, IRA member Chris Reilly, into passing information to the British Army's Intelligence Corps. As a result, the entire brigade is arrested. In their cell, Damien meets the train driver, Dan, a union official who shares Damien's socialist views. Meanwhile, British officers interrogate Teddy, pulling out his fingernails when he refuses to give them the names of IRA members. Johnny Gogan, a British soldier of Irish descent, helps the prisoners escape, but three are left behind. After the actions of Sir John and Chris are revealed to the IRA's intelligence network, both are taken hostage. As Teddy is still recovering, Damien is temporarily placed in command. News arrives that the three remaining IRA prisoners have been tortured and shot. Simultaneously, the brigade receives orders to \"execute the spies\". Despite the fact that Chris is a lifelong friend, Damien shoots both him and Sir John. Later, the IRA ambushes and wipes out a convoy of the Auxiliary Division, and in retaliation another detachment of Auxiliaries loots and burns the farmhouse of Damien's sweetheart, Cumann na mBan member Sinéad Sullivan. Sinéad is held at gunpoint while her head is roughly shorn, her scalp being wounded in the process. Later, as Damien treats her, a messenger arrives with news of a formal ceasefire between Britain and the IRA. After the Anglo-Irish Treaty is signed, the brigade learns that a partitioned Ireland will only be granted Dominion status within the British Empire. As a result, the brigade divides over accepting the terms of the Treaty. Teddy and his allies argue that accepting the Treaty will bring peace now while further gains can be made later. Others oppose the Treaty, proposing to continue fighting until a united Irish Republic can be obtained. Dan and Damien further demand the collectivisation of industry and agriculture. Any other course, declares Dan, will change only \"the accents of the powerful and the colour of the flag\". Soon the Irish Free State replaces British rule, and Teddy and his allies begin patrolling in National Army uniforms. Meanwhile, Damien and his allies join the Anti-Treaty IRA. When the Battle of Dublin launches the Irish Civil War, the Anti-Treaty column commences guerrilla warfare against Free State forces. As the violence escalates, Teddy expresses fear that the British will invade if the republicans gain the upper hand. His position is: \"They take one out, we take one back. To hell with the courts.\" Soon after, Dan is killed and Damien is captured during a raid for arms on an Irish Army barracks commanded by Teddy. Sentenced to execution, Damien is held in the same cell where the British Army imprisoned them earlier. Desperate to avoid executing his brother, Teddy pleads with Damien to reveal where the Anti-Treaty IRA is hiding the stolen rifles. In return, Teddy offers Damien full amnesty, a life with Sinéad, and the vision of an Ireland where Pro- and Anti-Treaty Irishmen can raise families side by side. Insulted, Damien responds by saying that he will never \"sell out\" the Republic the way Chris Reilly did and Teddy leaves the cell in tears. Damien writes a goodbye letter to Sinéad, expressing his love for her, and quoting Dan's words: \"It's easy to know what you're against, quite another to know what you're for\". But he says that he knows what he stands for and is not afraid to die for it and tells Sinéad to look after Teddy. At dawn, Damien dies before a firing squad commanded by a heartbroken yet obstinate Teddy. Teddy delivers Damien's letter to Sinéad who is distraught and heartbroken. She attacks Teddy and orders him to leave her land.",

    "Synopsis": "Raimunda, her sister Sole and Raimunda's daughter Paula are visiting the small village of Alcanfor de las Infantas, in La Mancha region of Spain. Though they both now live in Madrid, the sisters grew up in the village. The three have returned to take care of the gravesite of their parents, who died in a fire a few years previous, and to visit their ailing, dementia-impaired aunt, also named Paula. They also call on Agustina, a next door neighbor who looks in on their aunt every day. Raimunda and Paula live with Raimunda's husband, Paco, who Paula believes is her father. When Paco attempts to rape Paula, saying that he is not really her father, Paula stabs him to death in self-defense. Claiming her husband has run off, Raimunda hides his corpse in the deep-freezer of a shut-down nearby restaurant she is minding for the absent owner, Emilio. When members of a film crew come to the restaurant to cater a week's meals, the resourceful Raimunda strikes a deal to earn much needed money in her husband's absence. Meanwhile, Sole returns to the village upon hearing that Aunt Paula has passed. At Aunt Paula's wake Agustina confesses to Sole that she heard Paula talking to the ghost of Sole's and Raimunda's mother, Irene. Encountering her mother's ghost herself in Aunt Paula's house, upon returning to Madrid, Sole finds that the ghost was stowed away in the trunk of her car. Sole lets Irene stay with her to assist at the illicit hair salon Sole operates out of her apartment, posing as a Russian immigrant who doesn't speak Spanish. The two conceal Irene's presence from Raimunda, who hates her mother. Raimunda reveals to Paula that Paco was not her biological father, promising to tell her the whole story later. Leaving Paula with Sole, with the help of two paid suitably unquestioning female neighbors, Raimunda rents a van and transports the freezer containing the body to a spot by the river Júcar, where they bury it. Meanwhile, diagnosed with terminal cancer, Agustina comes to Madrid for treatment. When Raimunda visits her in the hospital, Agustina asks Raimunda if she has seen her mother's ghost; Raimunda fears that Agustina too is exhibiting dementia. Agustina hopes the ghost will be able to tell her about her own mother, who disappeared three years before. While staying in Sole's apartment, Paula meets her grandmother's ghost, growing close to her. The next night, Agustina comes to the restaurant and reveals two startling secrets: her mother and Raimunda's father were having an affair, and her mother disappeared on the same day that Raimunda's parents died. Sole reveals to a skeptical Raimunda that she has seen their mother's ghost, who is in the next room with Paula. Revealing the whole truth, Irene admits that she did not die in the fire. The reason for Raimunda and her estrangement, Irene has come to realize, is that Raimunda's father sexually abused Raimunda, resulting in the birth of Paula. Thus, Paula is Raimunda's daughter and her sister. Unaware of Raimunda's sexual abuse until Aunt Paula told her about it, Irene has never forgiven herself for being oblivious to it and believing Raimunda's pregnancy due to promiscuity. Finding her husband asleep in bed with another woman, Irene started the fire that killed them both. The ashes presumed to be Irene's were the ashes of Agustina's mother, the woman with whom Irene's husband was having an affair. After the fire, Irene wandered for several days in the countryside until deciding to turn herself in. First, however, she wanted to say goodbye to Aunt Paula, with whom Irene had been living prior to setting the fire and who had lost the ability to look after herself. Paula welcomed Irene home as if nothing had happened, and Irene stayed, caring for her sister and expecting that the police would come soon to arrest her. Due to the closed nature of the superstitious community, however, the police never came. Accustomed to tales of the dead returning, the residents explained the rare sightings of Irene as ghost sightings. The family reunites at Aunt Paula's house. Irene reveals her presence to Agustina, who continues to believe her to be a ghost. As penance, Irene pledges to stay in the village and care for Agustina as her cancer worsens, saying to Raimunda that it is the least she can do after killing Agustina's mother. Raimunda and her mother embrace and promise to repair their relationship, with Raimunda regularly visiting her mother at Agustina's house.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1987, two university students in an unnamed Romanian town, Otilia Mihărtescu and Gabriela \"Găbița\" Drăguț, are roommates in a dormitory. When Găbița becomes pregnant, the two young women arrange a meeting with Mr. Bebe in a hotel, where he is to perform an illegal abortion. At the college dorm, Găbița and Otilia review the items they need for the day. As Găbița nervously sits and waits, Otilia bargains and buys soap and cigarettes from the dormitory shop. Afterwards, Otilia takes a bus to visit her boyfriend Adi, from whom she borrows money. Adi asks Otilia to visit his family that night, as it is his mother's birthday. Otilia initially declines but relents after Adi becomes upset. Otilia heads to the Unirea hotel, where Găbița has booked a room, only to be informed by an unfriendly receptionist that there is no reservation under Găbița's last name. Otilia visits another hotel, the Tineretului, and after much begging and haggling, is able to book a room at an expensive rate. After speaking with Găbița on the telephone, Otilia goes to a rendezvous point to meet with Bebe, although he had asked Găbița to meet him personally. Mr. Bebe grows angry upon hearing that Găbița is not at the planned hotel. At the Tineretului, Bebe discovers that Găbița's claim that her pregnancy was in its second or third month was a lie, and that it has been at least four months. This changes the procedure and also adds the risk of a murder charge. While the two women were certain that they would pay no more than 3,000 lei for the abortion, it slowly becomes clear that Bebe expects both women to have sex with him. Desperate and distressed, Otilia has sex with Bebe, as does Găbița. Bebe then performs the abortion by injecting a probe and an unnamed fluid into Găbița's uterus and leaves Otilia instructions on how to dispose of the fetus when it comes out. Otilia is exasperated by Găbița's lies but continues to help and care for her. Otilia leaves Găbița at the Tineretului to attend Adi's mother's birthday party. She is still disturbed but stays and has dinner with Adi's mother's friends, who are mostly doctors. They converse about trivial matters while Otilia and Adi remain silent. After Otilia accepts a cigarette in front of Adi's parents, one of the guests starts talking about lost values and respect for elders. Adi and Otilia retreat to his room, where she tells him about Găbița's abortion. They begin debating what would happen if it were Otilia who was pregnant, as Adi is opposed to abortion. After the argument, Otilia calls Găbița from Adi's house. Găbița does not answer, so Otilia decides to return to the hotel. When Otilia enters the hotel room, Găbița is lying on the bed, and she tells Otilia that the fetus has been expelled and is in the bathroom. Otilia wraps the fetus with some towels and puts it in a bag, while Găbița asks her to bury it. Otilia walks outside, finally climbing to the top of a building, as Mr. Bebe had suggested, and drops the bag in a trash chute. She returns to the Tineretului and finds Găbița sitting in its restaurant. Otilia sits and tells Găbița that they are never going to talk about the episode again. Otilia stares blankly at Găbița.",

    "Synopsis": "Aleksandra Nikolaevna is invited by her grandson, Denis, a senior lieutenant (Stárshiy Leytenánt) in the Russian Army, to visit his military base in Chechnya. Her journey is aided by soldiers who have been ordered to be her escorts. But it is a lawless land; the two young happy-go-lucky conscripts who assist Nikolaevna on to an armoured train are assailed shortly after saying goodbye at the station. On arrival at the army camp, Aleksandra is taken to her grandson's platoon area and told to wait. But she refuses to sit inside the tents because of the sweltering summer heat. Wandering around, she meets and interacts with the young soldiers on the base. Many are standoffish at first but soon, after she shares some pies, some begin to talk to her. She returns to the tents to find Denis had returned. They hug and exchange pleasantries. Later Aleksandra meets her grandson's commanding officer who shows her around the base; he also questions her as to her reasons for visiting. He explains that Denis is a good officer but the request asking for permission for his grandmother to visit was bemusing. The next day she decides to leave the cantonments and visit the local market despite the reservations of the soldiers on guard duty. Nevertheless, she insists on going so they then ask her to get cigarettes and biscuits. In the town she discovers that many of the locals are hostile towards her because she is Russian. However she soon starts talking to an elderly Chechen woman named Malika who explains she was a teacher before the war. The local lady explains that many of the young people have been irreparably changed by the fighting. Malika gives Aleksandra some cigarettes and biscuits before inviting her back to her war-ravaged apartment where they drink tea and talk. Aleksandra thanks Malika and promises to return and pay her for the supplies. A local boy is then asked to take Aleksandra back to the Russian army camp. Although initially aggressive to her because she is a Russian, his attitude softens when she tells him that people should not be labelled together and that intelligence is more powerful than war. On arrival back at base, Aleksandra distributes the cigarettes and biscuits among the soldiers. Some then take her to a mess where she is given a hot meal. Aleksandra then returns to Denis' quarters where she finds her grandson mulling over his life in the army after he had to strike a soldier for disobeying him. After talking about their lives (she wants to live more even though her body is getting old), Denis soon brightens up and plaits his grandmother's hair while she promises to find him a wife. The next day, Aleksandra is woken up by Denis who tells her she has to leave now because he and his men are going on a five-day mission. Slowly the elderly lady gathers her things before making one last walk through the camp saying goodbye to the soldiers she met. At the gate, she says goodbye to Denis as he climbs onto an armoured vehicle and to his commanding officer who silently acknowledges the good her trip has done to her grandson and the men under his command. Aleksandra then walks back to town where she meets Malika and her local friends. Refusing to take any money for the cigarettes and biscuits, the group walk Aleksandra back to the armoured train. Aleksandra gives Malika her address asking her to come and visit her in Russia. She then boards a rolling car. The train moves off with Aleksandra waving from the doorway. With the train's departure, Malika turns and walks away with a grim expression. Aleksandra rides along looking out across the desolate empty fields of Chechnya.",

    "Synopsis": "Three friends, Arlene, Shanna and radio DJ \"Jungle\" Julia Lucai, drive down Congress Avenue in Austin, Texas, on their way to celebrate Julia's birthday. In a bar, Julia reveals that she made a radio announcement offering a free lap dance from Arlene in return for addressing her as \"Butterfly\", buying her a drink, and reciting a segment of the poem \"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\". Aging Hollywood stunt double \"Stuntman\" Mike trails the women to a bar and claims the lap dance. Arlene is suspicious, having seen Mike's car earlier that day, but he convinces her to give him the lap dance. The women prepare to depart with Lanna, another friend. Pam, Julia's old classmate, accepts Mike's offer of a ride home. Mike takes Pam to his Hollywood stunt car rigged with a roll cage and tells her the car is \"death proof\", but only for the driver. He speeds and slams on the brakes, smashing Pam's skull on the dashboard, killing her. He catches up with the women's car and drives into it head-on at high speed, killing them. Mike survives with no serious injury. Sheriff McGraw believes Mike killed the women intentionally, but because Mike was sober while the women were intoxicated, he cannot be charged. Fourteen months later, three young women, makeup artist Abernathy Ross, stunt driver Kim Mathis and actress Lee Montgomery, are driving through Lebanon, Tennessee on break from a film shoot. They stop at a convenience store, where Mike watches them from his car. The women pick up their friend, stuntwoman Zoë Bell, from the airport while Mike photographs them unaware. Zoë tells them she wants to test-drive a 1970 Dodge Challenger, the same type of car from the 1971 film Vanishing Point and has found one for sale nearby. The owner, Jasper, lets them test-drive it unsupervised after Abernathy tells him Lee is a porn star, and she is left behind as collateral. Zoë tells Abernathy and Kim that she wants to play a game they call \"Ship's Mast\", whereby she rides the hood holding belts fastened to the car while Kim drives at speed. Kim is hesitant but agrees. The three enjoy the stunt, unaware that Mike is watching them. He rear-ends them in his car, causing Zoë to lose her grip on both belts and is left holding on to the hood. After several more collisions, he T-bones them, throwing Zoë from the hood. Kim shoots Mike's left shoulder and he flees in his car. Abernathy and Kim cry over the apparent loss of their friend, until Zoë emerges uninjured. The three agree to catch up to Mike and kill him. The women catch up to Mike as he is treating his wound and ram him, then Zoë gets out and beats him with a pipe. They continue chasing him as he pleads for mercy, finally flipping his car off the road. They drag him from the wreckage and beat him to death. During the credits, photos of various women can be seen implying that they were all previous victims of Mike's.",

    "Synopsis": "Olga is a Ukrainian woman from Eastern Ukraine, who lives with her mother and has a child. Her job as a nurse does not pay well enough for her to support herself and her baby, and she gets a second job doing internet pornography. She eventually leaves her homeland and travels to Vienna, Austria, where she finds a job as a housekeeper at a rich family's home, where she also lives. The woman of the family suspects her of stealing and fires her. She is then employed as a cleaner at a geriatric hospital. She develops a relationship with an elderly man named Erich and he asks her to marry him. She accepts as she knows this will gain her Austrian citizenship. However, Erich dies of a heart attack before they can marry. Pauli is a young man from Vienna, Austria who lives with his mother and stepfather. He owns a large dog named Caeser and trains in martial arts. He works as a security guard at a shopping complex but is sacked after a gang of drunken Turks cuff him with his handcuffs and strip him of his clothes. His girlfriend breaks up with him as she is afraid of his dog, and he owes money to a number of people including his stepfather, Michael. Michael then takes him along on a job in Ukraine setting up video gambling machines. On the way there, they stop at an impoverished Romani neighbourhood in Košice, Slovakia, where Pauli tries to 'hire' a prostitute. He fails to agree on a price with the Romani pimps, and they chase him back to his van. When they arrive in Uzhhorod, Ukraine, they rent a hotel room and try to pick up girls at a bar. When Pauli goes back to his room to borrow money from Michael to pay his tab, he finds that Michael has a prostitute. Michael insists Pauli watches him humiliate the prostitute before he can leave. The next day, Pauli leaves Michael's company and searches for work at a local market, where he fails to find any. The last we see of him is when he is walking along a long country road, hitchhiking, either back to the West or further into Ukraine.",

    "Synopsis": "The film is divided into three parts: The Departure, The Absence and The Return. The film begins with Julie Pommeraye walking the streets of Paris; she goes to a cinema and from the tickets queue calls her boyfriend Ismaël Bénoliel on her cell phone. He is at work with Alice, but when Julie asks him he lies and says he is alone. Julie responds that he pisses her off. Later that night, Ismaël runs into Julie on his way home. They discuss Julie's frustrations about their relationship and eventually, already in their apartment, reconcile. Shortly afterwards Alice arrives; they all get into bed together, read a different book each and fight about each one's place in bed. The next day Julie and Ismaël have breakfast with Julie's family; Julie gets frustrated and leaves for the kitchen, followed by her older sister, Jeanne. Julie tells Jeanne and later her mother about Alice and the threesome. In the night, after Ismaël, Julie and Alice leave a bar where they were eating, Julie starts complaining about Ismaël's relationship with Alice; Ismaël responds that her jealousy is ironic considering she also has a sexual relationship with Alice, but that she is truly the only one he loves. Alice tells them that she is only there to bring them together. They go to a concert where Alice befriends a guy named Gwendal. Julie starts feeling bad, so she and Ismaël decide to leave. Outside, Julie collapses and suddenly dies. Going to work, Ismaël runs into Jeanne on her way to his and Julie's apartment. At work, he confronts Alice about his constant breakdowns since Julie's death and she comforts him. Since Jeanne is staying in Ismaël's apartment, he doesn't want to spend the night there, so Alice takes him to Gwendal's apartment. Ismaël spends the entire night awake; in the morning he meets Erwann, Gwendal's younger brother who also lives there, and who before leaving for school offers Ismaël his room so he can finally get some sleep. Erwann returns and wakes Ismaël up, who borrows some clean clothes from Erwann and leaves for work. Later that night, he discovers Erwann has been following him. Erwann asks to go home with Ismaël, who rejects him. Ismaël gets to his apartment to find Jeanne still there, so he goes to Erwann's apartment to spend the night again. The next day, Ismaël visits Julie's family. Later, upset over Julie, he spends the night with a bartender called Maud. Jeanne discovers the two of them in the apartment the next morning, but Ismaël dresses quickly and sneaks out as Jeanne and Maud chat. Ismaël goes to work to find Erwann waiting for him; he tells Erwann that he is flattered by his attention but is neither interested nor in need of him. Alice, having broken up with Gwendal, thinks Erwan had been sent by his brother to pick up the set of keys she had; she gives them to Ismaël to pass them on to Erwann. Leaving work, Ismaël finds Erwann waiting for him again. He returns the keys but then takes them back, and the two of them go to Ismaël's apartment. Meanwhile, Alice receives a phone call from Julie's mother and the two of them meet at a restaurant, where Julie's mother asks her to take care of Ismaël. Jasmine, Julie's other sister, comes to tell her mother that her father is upset that she is still out so late at night, so she leaves. Alice and Jasmine briefly discuss their grief. Ismaël and Erwann sleep together that night. Jeanne lets herself into Ismaël's apartment, discovers Erwann there, and leaves. He follows her into the street where they walk and she explains that she is trying to understand his process of grief, and admits his disinterest in children and threesome arrangement with Julie and Alice can finally be explained by his homosexuality. He neither confirms nor denies this, and the two part unreconciled and upset. Erwann goes to Ismaël's office only to find Alice. He confirms that he and Ismaël are in the midst of a fling he hopes will develop further. Meanwhile, Ismaël, upset, visits Julie's grave and battles with his guilt over both not visiting sooner and his many sexual exploits since her death as a means of coping. Alice eventually finds him drunk at a bar and takes him to Erwann's, who invites him to stay. Ismaël explains that he will continue their affair as long as Erwann is comfortable not hearing that Ismaël loves him, and Erwann says Ismaël can stay as long as he is okay hearing he is loved. On the roof, Ismaël tells Erwann to \"love him less but love him for a long time\" and they kiss as Alice looks on from below. thumb|Chiara Mastroianni, [[Catherine Deneuve daughter ]]This film refers to many other cinematographic works but the most obvious one is to Jacques Demy's film The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and, more widely, to Demy's work. The layout of both films is divided into three parts: The Departure, The Absence, and The Return. Furthermore, as a nod to the French actress Catherine Deneuve (the main character of The Umbrellas of Cherbourg), her daughter, Chiara Mastroianni, performs in the role of Julie's sister. The two have a scene where they wear the Epiphany crown, being filmed the same way. This film is also in tribute to The Young Girls of Rochefort as some sailors appear unexpectedly in a street in Paris, and to Lola and A Room in Town, two other musical films of Jacques Demy, because Julie's last name (Pommeraye) is also the name of The Passage Pommeraye of Nantes, seen in these films.",

    "Synopsis": "Jeremy, an émigré from Manchester, owns a small New York City café. He provides customer Elizabeth with clues that reveal her boyfriend is cheating on her. Devastated, she breaks up with him and becomes a regular at the diner, arriving late at night for blueberry pie and to share stories with Jeremy. One night, after they are assaulted in separate incidents, Elizabeth falls asleep at the counter. Jeremy sneaks a kiss while she sleeps and she subtly smiles. Later that night, Elizabeth stands on a curb and sadly watches her ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend through their apartment window. Elizabeth, now calling herself Lizzie, drifts to Memphis, Tennessee. She takes two jobs, waitress by day and bartender by night, to earn enough money to eventually purchase a car. She regularly sends postcards to Jeremy without revealing where exactly she lives or works. He tries to locate her by calling and sending postcards to all the restaurants in the area, but to no avail. One of Elizabeth's regulars at both jobs is local police officer Arnie Copeland, an alcoholic who cannot accept that his wife, Sue Lynne, has left him. She openly flaunts her new relationship with a younger man, deepening Arnie's sorrow. He shows Elizabeth his pocketful of AA sobriety tokens and recounts his many attempts at sobriety. One night, while off duty in Elizabeth's bar, Arnie drunkenly threatens Sue Lynne with his gun if she leaves, but he doesn't shoot her. Later on, he drives drunk, crashes into a pole and dies. Elizabeth comforts Sue Lynne at the crash site, where she had first met him, suggesting he may have committed suicide. Before both women say goodbye to the town, Sue Lynne gives her Arnie's tab money, admitting she had made a mistake and she misses him. Heading west, Elizabeth – now Beth – gets another server job at a casino in a small town in Nevada. She meets Leslie, an inveterate poker player who has lost all her money. Elizabeth lends her $2,200 in exchange for the money back, plus a third of her winnings. However, if she loses, then Elizabeth gets Leslie's car, a new Jaguar XK. When Leslie does lose, she fulfills her promise, but asks for a lift to Las Vegas to borrow money from her estranged father. En route, a Vegas hospital calls to inform Leslie that her father has been admitted and is dying. She believes the call is a ruse to lure her back, but upon arrival she discovers that he actually died the previous night. Leslie announces she's keeping the car, which she had stolen from her father. He had sent her the vehicle's title and registration, despite their estrangement. She confesses she actually won the poker game and subsequently helps Elizabeth negotiate the purchase of her dream car. Elizabeth returns to Manhattan and the café, where Jeremy has kept a stool at the counter reserved for her ever since she left. As she eats a slice of blueberry pie, Elizabeth realizes her feelings for him are reciprocated. She 'passes out' on the counter after spending the night in conversation. Jeremy again steals a kiss while she is asleep, but she returns the kiss.",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be 400-700 words for feature films --> In 1980, hitman Anton Chigurh is arrested in Texas. He escapes by strangling the sheriff's deputy and stealing a car by killing the driver with a captive bolt pistol. Later, he spares the life of a gas station owner for correctly calling a coin toss. Llewelyn Moss is hunting pronghorns in the desert. He comes across the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong, finding several dead men, a wounded Mexican man begging for water, drugs in a truck, and a briefcase containing $2 million in cash. He takes the briefcase and returns home. Feeling guilty, he returns with water that night but finds the man has been murdered. He looks up to the ridge and sees two men with guns who pursue him in a truck. He escapes by diving into a river. After making his way back home, Moss sends his wife, Carla Jean, to stay with her mother. Chigurh is hired to recover the missing money; meanwhile, Terrell County Sheriff Ed Tom Bell begins investigating the failed drug deal. Chigurh searches Moss's trailer home, using his bolt pistol to blow out the door lock. Moss takes a taxi to a motel in Del Rio, where he hides the briefcase in his room's air duct. After Moss returns to the motel after purchasing new boots, he sees the curtains in his room in a different position from when he left, and rightly assumes he has been found. Following a tracking device hidden in the case, Chigurh goes to Moss's motel and kills three Mexican mobsters who were waiting for Moss in his room. Moss has rented a second room adjacent to his first room with access to the duct where the money is hidden. He retrieves the briefcase before Chigurh opens the duct. Moving to a hotel in the border town of Eagle Pass, Moss discovers the tracking device, but Chigurh has already found him. Their firefight spills onto the streets, badly wounding both and killing a truck driver. Moss flees to Mexico, hiding the case along the Rio Grande. Chigurh cleans and stitches his wounds with stolen supplies. Carson Wells, a bounty hunter, visits a wounded Moss in a Mexican hospital and offers protection from Chigurh in exchange for the money, but Moss refuses. Chigurh ambushes Wells at his hotel. The phone rings as Wells is bartering for his life. Chigurh fatally shoots him and takes the call from Moss, vowing to kill Carla Jean unless Moss gives up the money. Moss retrieves the case from the Rio Grande and arranges to meet Carla Jean at a motel in El Paso, where he plans to give her the money and hide her from danger. Carla Jean's mother unknowingly reveals Moss's location to a group of Mexicans tailing them. Bell reaches the motel in El Paso, only to find that the Mexicans have killed Moss. Carla Jean arrives later and weeps when Bell somberly removes his hat. That night, Bell returns to the crime scene and sees that the lock has been blown out. Chigurh appears to be on the other side of the door, holding his shotgun. Bell hesitantly enters and finds the room empty, and notices that the room's air duct has been opened. Carla Jean returns from her mother's funeral to find Chigurh waiting in her bedroom. Chigurh says he must fulfill his vow, but offers a coin toss as a compromise. Carla Jean refuses to call it, saying that only he can be responsible for her fate.<!-- Please do not describe off-screen events. --> Chigurh checks the soles of his boots as he leaves the house. As he drives through the neighborhood, another car crashes into him, breaking his arm. He pays a passing boy for the shirt off his back to use as a sling, and limps away. Bell visits a relative and former lawman, Ellis,<!-- The screenplay and movie do not explicitly specify a relationship. --> and tells him he plans to retire because he feels overmatched by the recent violence. Ellis tells Bell that he cannot evade fate, and only vanity makes him think otherwise. Bell retires from the force. One morning, he shares two dreams with his wife. In the first, he lost some money his father had given him. In the other, as he rode on horseback through a snowy mountain pass, his father rode past him carrying fire in a horn, and he knew his father would prepare a campfire ahead for both of them.",

While the train is moving a security guard notices the pair, chases after them, and tries to get them off by hitting Scratch with his flashlight. During the melee, Alex hits him with his skateboard and the guard, losing balance, falls onto another track into the path of an oncoming freight train which cuts him in half. Alex tries to destroy some of the evidence: he throws his skateboard into the Willamette River from the Steel Bridge, and showers and disposes of the clothes he had been wearing. Alex is later questioned at school by Detective Richard Lu, as are several other students who had been skateboarding on the night in question. It is revealed that the police have recovered Alex's skateboard, though they have not traced it back to him, and have identified DNA evidence which places the skateboard at the scene of the security guard's death. Throughout the film, Alex keeps the incident to himself, and does not confide in anyone else. After having impassive sex with his girlfriend, Jennifer, he breaks up with her. Another of his friends, Macy, notices that he is worried about something. She advises him to write down whatever is bothering him as a cathartic release if nothing else. He initially rejects the idea, but eventually writes an account, which becomes the basis for the story. After completing the written account, Alex burns it.",

    "Synopsis": "At Orly Airport in Paris, Marjane \"Marji\" Satrapi prepares to board a plane to Tehran, but changes her mind at the last moment. She spends the whole day at the airport, reflecting on her life before her departure to France. During the 1979 Iranian revolution against the Shah of Iran, Marji's upper middle-class family participates in the rallies, though she is forbidden from attending. Marji's uncle Anouche comes to dinner upon release from prison, inspiring Marji with stories of his life on the run from the government. The Shah is deposed, and elections for a new leading power commence; Islamic fundamentalists win the elections and impose strict Islamic law, forcing women to dress \"modestly\" and wear headscarves. Anouche is rearrested and executed for his political beliefs. Over time, many Iranians escape abroad. The Iran–Iraq War breaks out and the Iranian government takes away even more social freedoms. Marji's uncle Taher suffers a heart attack and must go to England for surgery, but only those approved by the Board of Health can leave the country. When Marji's aunt seeks permission, she finds that the hospital director is her former window washer, who is incompetent and submissive to religion. Marji and her father visit Khosro for a fake passport. Khosro is sheltering Niloufar, a woman wanted for her Communist beliefs. When Niloufar is caught and executed, Khosro flees. Taher dies afterward. As she grows up, Marji buys heavy metal music on the black market and wears Western clothing. When she rebuts a teacher's lies about government abuses, she is expelled. Fearing her arrest, her parents send her to a French lycée in Vienna to live with her mother's best friend. Marjane is later sent to live in a boarding house with Catholic nuns. Marji makes few friends and feels isolated. After she insults a nun, she is thrown out. She moves from house to house until she rents a room from Dr. Frau Schloss, a former teacher with an unstable personality. One night, as she leaves a party where she lies about being French, Marji hears her grandmother's voice telling her to stay true to herself. She develops a relationship with Markus, but it ends after she catches him cheating on her with another woman. Schloss accuses Marji of stealing, and Marji leaves. She spends the day on a park bench, reflecting upon her actions and realizing she has nowhere to go. After living on the street for a few months, she contracts bronchitis and almost dies. She awakens in a Viennese hospital, where she is allowed to make a phone call home. Marji returns to Iran with her family's hopes that the end of the war will improve their lives. She grows depressed, and attempts suicide by overdosing on medication. She dreams of meeting God, who insists that her time is not over. Jolted out of her depression, she attends university and starts dating fellow student Reza. While waiting for Reza outside, Marji lies to a police officer to avoid arrest for wearing makeup, saying a man nearby who had been ogling her had made indecent comments to her. Her grandmother is disappointed and tells her that both her grandfather and her uncle died for freedom and that she should never sacrifice her integrity. Marji gives a speech during class, challenging the sexist double standard in the university's forum on public morality, but both Marji's and Reza's families are fined when the two are caught holding hands in public. Marji and Reza marry, but divorce a year later. The fundamentalist police raid a party that Marji is attending. The women are detained while the men escape across the rooftops. One of them, Nima, falls to his death. Marji decides to leave Iran again. Before leaving, she visits the graves of her grandfather and uncle. Her mother forbids her from returning, and her grandmother dies soon after her departure. In the present, at Orly, Marji gets into a taxi. As it leaves the airport, the driver asks where she is coming from. She replies, \"Iran\". She recalls her final memory of her grandmother.",

Jong-chan claims he is only trying to be a Good Samaritan. One afternoon, Shin-ae meets a middle-school girl (referred to as \"the girl\"), whose father is Jun's daycare teacher, Park Do-seop. Just outside her home, Shin-ae hears from a pharmacist that the solution to her problems is belief in God. Shin-ae is skeptical but nevertheless takes the pharmacist's scripture. At home, Shin-ae and Jun engage in a prank where Shin-ae pretends to be unable to find Jun. Shin-ae's brother visits from Seoul, wondering why she is in Miryang considering that her husband cheated on her. Shin-ae denies this but still hates her late husband for unspecified reasons. Before leaving, the brother tells Jong-chan that he is not Shin-ae's type. One night, Shin-ae returns home late after partying to discover that Jun is missing. She receives a phone call (implied to be from Jun's kidnapper) and draws all of the money from her bank account to pay as ransom. Appalled at the pitiful amount of money she paid, Shin-ae says attempt to buy land was a lie to appear rich; she had no more money. Returning home, Shin-ae discovers the girl peering into her residence; the latter refuses to explain why and escapes. Later, police officers arrive to take her to a reservoir, where Jun was drowned. The murderer is swiftly captured and he is Jun's daycare teacher Do-seop. Yet Shin-ae doesn't seem vengeful and sheds no tears at Jun's funeral. Feeling unwell one day, Shin-ae visits the pharmacist who convinces her to join their faith, though she doesn't understand why God would let an innocent child like Jun die. Followed by Jong-chan, Shin-ae soon becomes a believer and claims to have found inner peace; even Jong-chan starts going to church. At home, Shin-ae hears noises in her bathroom and opens the door, crying out Jun's name, but the bathroom user is a little boy from Jun's daycare. Dropping off the other daycare children, Shin-ae sees the girl being bullied but doesn't intervene. Shin-ae's church friends throw her a birthday party, during which she says she will visit Do-seop in prison to forgive him. Jong-chan doesn't understand why she needs to visit him to forgive but accompanies her. Surprisingly, Do-seop says he also found God and that God absolved him of his sins. Shin-ae cannot understand how God could forgive him before she has. Shin-ae later steals a CD of the song \"Lies\" from a store and blasts it on a loudspeaker where a group has gathered to thank God. That night, she receives a phone call, which she claims to Jong-chan to have been from the kidnapper; he dismisses the idea but tells her to calm down and arranges a dinner date the next day. Shin-ae walks into the pharmacy, however, and seduces the pharmacist's husband, but he cannot perform and she becomes sick. That evening, she goes to Jong-chan, who angrily rejects her proposal for sex. On the way home, she passes by a vigil for her by the pharmacist couple; it is interrupted when a rock is hurled at a window. At home, Shin-ae slashes her wrists. On the day of her discharge from the hospital, Jong-chan takes her to a salon, where the girl now works, to do her hair. She says she was sent to juvenile detention for hanging with the wrong crowd and quit school. In the middle of her cut, Shin-ae leaves the salon. At home, she begins cutting her own hair. Jong-chan arrives, offering to hold up a mirror for her.",

    "Synopsis": "Silent Light begins with a long tracking shot of the sun rising over a beautiful plain. The protagonist Johan, his wife Esther, and their children sit silently saying grace, after which each member of Johan's family departs from their home except for him. Once he is alone, he stops the clock on the wall and breaks down crying. Johan goes to work and discusses with a colleague that he is having an affair with a single woman by the name of Marianne; he makes it clear that his wife knows about the affair. Johan leaves work to meet Marianne in a field, and they begin to kiss. In the next scene, Johan's children are bathing and playing along a riverbank while he and his wife watch. They call one of their children over to bathe her, and as they are doing so, Esther begins to cry. Johan tells his father about the affair, but when they step outside to discuss it, the scene shows winter. No explanation is provided for the change of season. Johan's affair with Marianne continues; they have sex in a local hotel while Johan's children wait in a van with a stranger - someone whom Marianne seems to know and trust. As Johan is driving in his car with Esther, she confronts him about the affair. She says she is going to vomit and forces him to stop the car. She runs off taking a blue umbrella, telling him not to follow. She breaks down crying along the side of a field, has what the doctor later describes as \"coronary trauma,\" and dies. At her wake, friends and family are there to provide comfort. Johan visits the body, says his goodbyes, and goes outside for air. Marianne suddenly shows up at the wake and asks if she can spend a moment with Esther's body, which Johan allows. Marianne enters the room, slowly kisses Esther's body on the lips, and drops a tear on her cheek. Esther appears to return to life as Johan's father sets the clock on a nearby wall. Johan breaks down again, before one of his daughters says that \"Mum wants to see him.\" Marianne leaves silently as Johan prepares to enter the room in which Esther waits. The final few minutes of Silent Light are another tracking shot, with the sun setting.",

    "Synopsis": "In the film's opening scene, Mark comes to Alex's house for help removing a bullet from his arm. Mark is concerned about the dangers of going to a hospital because of his criminal affiliations and the police inquiries which would result from going to a public hospital. Mark recovers and in the following days, Alex brings his wife Vera and two children for a trip to his childhood home in the countryside. The tranquility of the countryside is broken when Vera tells Alex that she is pregnant, but that this baby is not his. The rift between the couple grows but the two try to keep up appearances in the presence of their children and the old friends that visit them. Alex is unsure about what to do and turns to his brother Mark for advice. On the way to meet Mark at the train station, Alex's son Kir reveals that Alex's young friend Robert was at their house one day while Alex was away for work. Alex concludes that Robert is the baby's father. Vera feels estranged from her husband, and fears that Kir will follow in Alex and Mark's criminal footsteps. In the end, Alex forces Vera to have an abortion hoping they will be able to re-build their relationship and save their marriage once this unborn baby is out of the way. While their children are at a friend's house, he gets Mark to use his criminal connections to find a doctor to perform the procedure in their own house. After the abortion Vera commits suicide by overdosing on pain relieving medication. Alex and Mark rush the funeral formalities as gossip spreads quickly in the countryside. After returning home from the funeral parlour, Mark has a serious heart attack. Against the advice of the doctor, he attends Vera's funeral but dies before he and his brother return home. Alex returns to the city alone and goes to Robert's house with the intention of killing him. Alex falls asleep in his car outside the house and is awoken by Robert who invites him in. As he retrieves the gun from the glove box, he discovers an envelope containing the results of Vera's pregnancy test and a letter written by Vera on the back. The film cuts to a flashback of the time Robert came to Alex's home while he was away. It is revealed that the day before, Vera attempted to commit suicide by overdosing on pills but is saved by Robert. The next day, Vera finds out she is pregnant and confides with Robert, revealing that she never had an affair and that the baby was in fact Alex's, even though she says it felt like it wasn't his as they hardly ever talk. She expressed concerns about having another baby in this relationship that was lacking communication.",

    "film_title": "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (film)",
    "Synopsis": "The first third of the film is told from the main character's, Jean-Dominique Bauby, or Jean-Do as his friends call him, first person perspective. The film opens as Bauby wakes from his three-week coma in a hospital in Berck-sur-Mer, France. After an initial falsely positive description from one doctor, a neurologist explains that Bauby has locked-in syndrome, an extremely rare condition in which the patient is almost completely physically paralyzed, but remains mentally unchanged. At first, the viewer primarily hears Bauby's \"thoughts\" (he thinks that he is speaking but no one hears him), which are inaccessible to the other characters (who are seen through his one functioning eye). A speech therapist and physical therapist try to help Bauby become as functional as possible. Bauby cannot speak, but he develops a system of communication involving blinking his left eye as his therapist reads a list of letters; with this process, Bauby spells out messages one letter at a time. Gradually, the film's restricted point of view widens, and the viewer begins to see Bauby through scenes from his past as well as via the perspectives of those around him. The film shows a visit to Lourdes and conveys Bauby's fantasies about beaches, mountains, the Empress Eugénie and an erotic feast with one of his transcriptionists. We learn that Bauby had been editor of the popular French fashion magazine Elle, and that he had a deal to write a book reimagining The Count of Monte Cristo from a female perspective. He decides that he will still write a book, using his slow and exhausting communication technique. A woman from the publishing house with which Bauby had the original book contract takes dictation. The new book describes his current life, trapped in his body, which he sees as being suspended in murky water within an old-fashioned deep-sea diving bell with brass helmet, which is called a scaphandre in French. But those around him describe his still-vibrant spirit as a butterfly. The story of Bauby's writing is juxtaposed with his recollections and regrets prior to his stroke. We see his three children, their mother, his mistress, his friends, and his father. He encounters people from his past whose lives bear similarities to his own \"entrapment\": a friend who was kidnapped in Beirut and held in solitary confinement for four years, and his own 92-year-old father, who is confined to his own apartment, because he is too frail to descend four flights of stairs. Bauby eventually completes his memoir and hears the critics' responses. He dies of pneumonia ten days after its publication. The closing credits are accentuated by reversed shootings of breaking glacier ice (the forward versions are used in the opening credits), accompanied by the Joe Strummer & the Mescaleros song \"Ramshackle Day Parade\".",

    "Synopsis": ";Yeter's Death Retired widower Ali Aksu (Tuncel Kurtiz), a Turkish immigrant living in Bremen, {Germany]]. He believes he has found a solution to his loneliness when he meets Yeter Öztürk (Nursel Köse). He offers her a monthly payment to stop working as a prostitute and move in with him. After receiving threats from two Turkish Muslims for the work she does, she decides to accept his offer. Ali's son, Nejat Aksu (Baki Davrak), a professor of German literature, does not have time to respond to the prospect of living with a woman of \"easy virtue\" before Ali is stricken with a heart attack. He softens to her: he learns that she has told her 27-year-old daughter she is a shoe saleswoman, sending shoes to her in Turkey to support that story, and wishes her daughter could receive an education like his. After returning home from the hospital, Ali suspects Yeter and his son may have had a liaison. When his drunken demands of Yeter cause her to threaten to leave, he strikes her, and she dies from the blow. Ali is sent to prison. Nejat travels to Istanbul to search for Yeter's daughter, Ayten (Nurgül Yeşilçay), and assumes responsibility for her education. Unable to locate her through her family and not having any recent photos of her, he posts flyers with Yeter's photo throughout the area, in hope that it will lead to the daughter. When he posts a flyer in a small German language bookstore that happens to be for sale, he finds himself charmed into buying it. ;Lotte's Death A plainclothes officer loses his gun on the street during a riot. A hooded figure scoops it up and is pursued on foot by a battalion of uniformed officers, barely managing to hide the contraband on a random rooftop. This is Ayten, member of a Turkish anti-government resistance group. When her cell is raided, she flees Turkey and takes up a new identity with political allies in Bremen, Germany. However, even there, she has a falling out when she is unable to pay them money she owes, and thus finds herself on the street with barely a euro to her name. Her mother's number is lost, so she lives illegally and searches for her in local shoe shops. Lotte, a university student, offers to help her with food, clothes, and a place to stay—a gesture which is not particularly welcomed by her mother, Susanne. Ayten and Lotte become lovers and Lotte decides to help Ayten search for her mother. The quest is cut short when a traffic stop exposes Ayten's illegal status and she attempts a claim of political asylum. Despite Susanne's financial support, Germany rules that Ayten has no legitimate fear of political persecution. She is deported and immediately imprisoned. Lotte is devastated. She travels to Turkey to try to free Ayten, but quickly realizes how little hope there is, as she is facing 15 to 20 years in jail. Susanne pleads with her to think of her future and return home. When Lotte refuses, her mother denies her any further assistance. Lotte gravitates to Nejat's bookstore and ends up renting a spare room from him. Finally granted a prison visit with Ayten, Lotte complies with her imprisoned lover's request and retrieves the handgun Ayten grabbed in the riot. But Lotte's bag, with the gun inside, is snatched by a crew of boys that she then chases through their neighborhood. When finally she finds them in a vacant lot, one of them is inspecting the gun. She demands he return it, but he points it at her and fires, killing her instantly. ;The Edge of Heaven (literally, On the Other Side) Upon his release, Ali is deported to Turkey, returning to his property in Trabzon on the Black Sea coast. After her daughter's death, Susanne goes to Istanbul to see where her daughter had been living the past few months. She meets Nejat and reads her daughter's diary; she decides to take on her daughter's mission of freeing Ayten from prison. Susanne's visit to Ayten—an offer of forgiveness and support—leads the younger woman to exercise her right of repentance. As a result, she wins her freedom. Susanne asks Nejat about the story behind a Bayram festival they hear about, learning that it commemorates Ibrahim's sacrifice of his son Ishmael. She comments that there is the same story in the Bible, where Abraham is asked to sacrifice his son Isaac. Nejat reminisces about being scared by the story as a child and asking his father if he would sacrifice him if God told him to. When asked by Susanne what his father's answer was, Nejat tells her that his father said \"He would make God his enemy in order to protect me.\" Nejat removes the flyer of Yeter from the shop's noticeboard. He asks Susanne to look after his shop while he is gone, and drives to Trabzon, where his father is living. Susanne offers Ayten a place to stay with her at Nejat's house. When Nejat arrives in Trabzon, his father is out fishing, so he waits for him on the beach.",

    "film_title": "The Last Mistress",
    "Synopsis": "In 1835 Paris, the Vicomte de Prony visits a beautiful kept woman of Malagan birth, La Vellini. He tells her that her longstanding affair with libertine Ryno de Marigny must come to an end, as Ryno is to be married. On his way out, he encounters Ryno, who has resolved to visit his mistress one more time. After they have sex, Ryno tells Vellini that their relationship is finished; Vellini is doubtful. Elsewhere, the Marquise de Flers, grandmother of Ryno's bride-to-be, and the Comtesse d'Artelles, her friend and the wife of Vicomte de Prony, discuss the upcoming nuptials: the Marquise arranged the marriage, and believes that the union will benefit both Ryno and his innocent bride, Hermangarde, while d'Artelles expresses doubt that the penniless Ryno will escape his libertine past. As she leaves, she tells the Marquise that Ryno has had a mistress for a decade. Ryno visits his bride-to-be and her grandmother; after she sends Hermangarde to bed, she compels Ryno to tell her the whole truth of his relationship with Vellini before she can give her final blessing. A decade earlier, Ryno lives the carefree life of a young aristocratic libertine in Baden. One of his friends introduces him to La Vellini, the wife of an elderly, wealthy baronet, Sir Reginald. Ryno quickly falls madly in love with Vellini, who scorns and mocks him. On a ride in the Bois de Boulogne, Ryno encounters Vellini and attempts to kiss her. Her husband, aghast, challenges him to a duel. Ryno delopes in an attempt to end the duel, but Sir Reginald shoots him anyway, badly wounding him. As Ryno is operated on, Vellini appears and licks the blood from his wound, initiating a torrid affair. For the next two years, as Ryno convalesces, Vellini visits him, and eventually leaves her husband, causing a stir in the Parisian scene. Once he recovers, the couple moves to Algeria, where they live together and have a daughter. Their daughter dies after being stung by a scorpion, throwing the couple into a mad grief. They have sex next to their daughter's pyre. Back in France, Vellini and Ryno acknowledge their mutual loathing over their daughter's death, but the tragedy continues to irresistibly draw them together. Eventually, Ryno falls out of love with Vellini. Satisfied by his story, the Marquise allows the marriage to take place. As promised, Ryno and his bride move away from Paris, to a castle on the Norman coast. There, they enjoy a few months of conjugal bliss, and Hermangarde becomes pregnant. However, one day as Ryno takes a solitary walk, Vellini appears (having followed the couple to Normandy), telling him that he must either kill or kiss her. They kiss. The affair is reignited while Hermangarde mostly stays in the castle due to her pregnancy; however, her dread grows after she notices Vellini loitering near the castle. One night, she walks to Vellini's house, where she finds her husband and Vellini having sex. The next morning, she miscarries. Some time later, in Paris, the Vicomte tells the Comtesse that Ryno has returned to regularly and openly visiting Vellini, apathetic to his wife. The tut-tutting Comtesse expresses relief that the Marquise de Flers has died and must not witness the state of the couple.",

    "film_title": "The Man from London",
    "Synopsis": "The film concerns a middle-aged railway pointsman, Maloin (Miroslav Krobot), who lives in a decrepit apartment in a port town with his highly-strung wife Camélia (Tilda Swinton) and his daughter Henriette (Erika Bók). One night while in his viewing tower at the port's rail terminus, Maloin witnesses a fight on the dockside. One of the shady combatants is knocked into the water along with the briefcase he carries; when the other flees the dark quayside, Maloin makes a clandestine descent from the tower and retrieves the briefcase, which he finds full of sodden English banknotes. Maloin conceals the money and tells no-one of what he has seen. The next morning, he visits a tavern where he plays chess with the barkeep (Gyula Pauer). On his way home, he stops by the butcher's where his daughter works, and finds to his indignation that they have her washing the floor. Later, from the window of his apartment, he notices Brown (János Derzsi) watching him from below. At dinner, Maloin is increasingly irascible, addressing Henriette brusquely and arguing with Camélia. Meanwhile, Brown searches the water at the dock's edge without success before noticing the watchtower overlooking the quayside, and Maloin within. Later at the tavern, a police inspector from London named Morrison (István Lénárt) discusses with Brown the matter of the stolen money. Morrison claims to be working on behalf of a theater owner named Mitchell, a theatre owner from whose office safe the £55,000 was stolen. Morrison proposes that Brown, being intimately familiar with Mitchell's office, is the only man he knows who was capable of making away with the money without raising alarm. Morrison indicates that Mitchell cares only that the money is returned swiftly, and is even prepared to offer a two nights' theater takings in exchange. When Morrison mentions having visited Brown's wife and asks what he should tell Mitchell, Brown leaves the room under a pretense and slips out a side door. Nearby playing chess with the barkeep, Maloin has overheard the conversation. Maloin calls to the butcher's and drags Henriette from the store against her will and over the protestations of the butcher's wife (Kati Lázár). He brings her to the tavern for a drink, where he overhears the barkeep telling another patron the story of Brown's meeting with the inspector, revealing that Morrison had called the local police when Brown absconded. Though Henriette refuses her drink, Maloin buys her an expensive mink stole. They return home to the consternation of Camélia, who cannot comprehend why Maloin has ruined Henriette's chances of a job and spent what little savings the family had on the extravagant stole. During Maloin's shift the next night he is visited by Morrison, who questions him as to the previous night's events as the body of the drowned man is retrieved from the quayside below. The next day at the tavern, Morrison meets Brown's wife (Agi Szirtes), and tells her that Brown is under suspicion for the theft and for the murder at the quayside. He asks for her help in finding him and repeats to her Mitchell's offer to Brown, but she remains silent. At home, Henriette tells Maloin she found a man in their hut at the seaside, and in fear locked the door and ran home. An agitated Maloin tells her not to tell anyone, and leaves for the hut. He unlocks the door, and receiving no response to his calling Brown's name, steps inside, closing the door behind. Minutes later he re-emerges, breathing heavily. After pausing to compose himself, he locks the door and leaves. In the next scene, Maloin presents the briefcase to Morrison in the tavern, and asks him to arrest him, confessing to having killed Brown an hour ago. Morrison leaves with Maloin for the hut, dismissing the frenzied inquiries of Brown's wife about her husband and handing the briefcase to the barkeep on the way out. Brown's wife follows the men to the hut, and emerges weeping with Morrison moments later. Back at the tavern, Morrison prepares two envelopes with a small portion of the recovered money in each. One he leaves with the grieving widow to whom he apologizes and wishes well, while the other he gives to Maloin, telling him that his case was one of self-defense. As he is preparing to leave, Morrison advises Maloin to go home and forget the whole affair. The camera focuses on the expressionless face of Brown's wife momentarily before fading to white.",

Estranged from both his father Albert (\"Burt\"), an NYPD Deputy Chief, and brother Joseph, a newly minted Captain, Bobby uses the maiden name of his late mother, Carol Green, as a part of his work alias and opts for a life of pleasure with his girlfriend Amada Juarez and best friend Louis \"Jumbo\" Falsetti, with a plan to soon run his own club in Manhattan. Joseph, who has just been named to be the head of a new anti-drug unit, warns Bobby that he will soon lead a bust on the spot with the aim of netting Vadim. Bobby is jailed for drug possession and resisting arrest in the wake of the raid on November 22, souring his ties with Burt and Joseph, who both bail him out of jail the next day; he and Joseph later engage in a harsh feud. That evening, a masked Vadim shoots Joseph in the face outside his house and firebombs his car, causing him to be confined at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center for 4 months. A remorseful Bobby agrees to the request of Michael Solo, a comrade of Burt, to go inside Vadim's drug operation behind Burt's back. When the transceiver hidden in his lighter is exposed, he evades death as Vadim is nabbed by the police. The bond between Bobby and Amada decays while they are hiding at the Kew Motor Inn, and they prep for a move to the Corona Hotel after Vadim flees from Rikers Island on March 20, 1989. In the midst of a heavy deluge, his men ambush the three-car escort, one of whom fatally wounds Burt with a shot to the neck. Bobby passes out in the rain upon seeing his body, wakes up a few hours later atop a bed in a suite at the Sheraton near Kennedy Airport, and breaks down when Joseph tells him that Burt is dead. At the funeral, Jack Shapiro, a colleague of Burt, donates Burt's Korean War combat ribbon to Joseph, and Michael informs him of a Russian cocaine shipment that is set to arrive in the area in the next week. Amada breaks up with Bobby once he chooses to join the NYPD to avenge the death of his father, upset because he neglected to ask for her input or consent prior to pursuing such a risky change of career. Sworn into the force due to his special knowledge, provided that he will undergo training at the Police Academy once the case is wrapped up, he questions Jumbo outside El Caribe on the night of April 2, 1989; Jumbo admits that Marat coerced him into betraying Bobby by leaking word from Amada re the pair's location to himself and Vadim. The brothers plan a final sting set for that Tuesday, as he recounts that per Jumbo, Marat's grandchildren, whom he takes to Floyd Bennett Field on Tuesdays, act as his couriers. During the sting, Joseph is numbed by his prior injury and is thus unable to proceed, and so Bobby chases Vadim into the reed beds. As the police, having cuffed Marat, toss flares, he goes into the beds, defying Michael's pleas to wait until Vadim comes out. He then spots and kills him with a fatal blow to the chest from his gun. On November 3, 1989, Bobby, now clad in his NYPD dress blues, graduates from the academy. Prior to the ceremony, Joseph reveals to him that he will transfer to a post in the Personnel Bureau so as to freely spend more time at home with his wife and 3 children. As the chaplain states in his opening remarks that Bobby will deliver the valedictorian address after the invocation, noting him as the highest academic achiever of his class, Bobby eyes a woman in the crowd who faintly resembles Amada and accepts that their romantic relationship is over. During the invocation, the siblings, seated side by side on stage, softly express their brotherly love.",

    "film_title": "Zodiac (film)",
    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. --> On July 4, 1969, an unknown man attacks Darlene Ferrin and Mike Mageau with a handgun at a lovers' lane in Vallejo, California. Only Mike survives. One month later, the San Francisco Chronicle receives encrypted letters written by the killer calling himself \"Zodiac\", who threatens to kill a dozen people unless his coded message containing his identity is published. Political cartoonist Robert Graysmith, who correctly guesses that his identity is not in the message, is not taken seriously by crime reporter Paul Avery or the editors and is excluded from the initial details about the killings. When the newspaper publishes the letters, a married couple deciphers one, revealing it indeed did not contain the killer's name. In September, the killer stabs law student Bryan Hartnell and Cecelia Shepard at Lake Berryessa in Napa County; Cecelia dies two days later. At the office, Avery makes fun of Graysmith before they discuss the coded letters. Graysmith interprets the letter, which Avery finds helpful, and he begins sharing information. One of Graysmith's insights about the letters is that Zodiac's reference to man as \"the most dangerous animal of them all\" is a reference to the 1932 film The Most Dangerous Game, which features the villainous Count Zaroff, a man who hunts live human prey. Two weeks later, San Francisco taxicab driver Paul Stine is shot and killed in the city's Presidio Heights district. The Zodiac killer mails pieces of Stine's bloodstained shirt to the Chronicle along with a taunting letter. San Francisco police inspectors Dave Toschi and his partner Bill Armstrong are assigned to the case by Captain Marty Lee and work closely with Vallejo's Jack Mulanax and Captain Ken Narlow in Napa. Someone claiming to be Zodiac continues to send taunting letters and speaks on the phone with lawyer Melvin Belli on the KGO-TV morning talk show hosted by Jim Dunbar. In 1971, Detectives Toschi, Armstrong, and Mulanax question Arthur Leigh Allen, a suspect in the Vallejo case. They notice that he wears a Zodiac wristwatch, with the same logo used by the killer, and Toschi thinks he is the killer. However, a handwriting expert insists that Allen did not write the Zodiac letters, even though Allen is said to be ambidextrous. Avery receives a letter threatening his life; becoming paranoid, he turns to drugs and alcohol. He shares information with the Riverside Police Department that the killer might have been active before the initial killings, angering Toschi and Armstrong. The case's notoriety weighs on Toschi, who cannot sit through a Hollywood film, Dirty Harry, loosely based on the Zodiac case. By 1976, Avery has moved to the Sacramento Bee. Graysmith persistently contacts Toschi about the Zodiac murders and eventually impresses him with his knowledge of the case. While Toschi cannot directly give Graysmith access to the evidence, he provides names in other police departments where Zodiac murders occurred. Armstrong transfers from the San Francisco Police homicide division, and Toschi is demoted for supposedly forging a Zodiac letter. Graysmith continues his own investigation, profiled in the Chronicle, and gives a television interview about the book he is writing on the case. He begins receiving phone calls from someone breathing heavily. As his obsession deepens, Graysmith loses his job, and his wife Melanie leaves him, taking their children. Graysmith learns that Allen lived close to Ferrin and probably knew her and that his birthday matches the one Zodiac gave when he spoke to one of Melvin Belli's maids. While circumstantial evidence seems to indicate his guilt, the physical evidence, such as fingerprints and handwriting samples, does not implicate him. In 1983, Graysmith tracks Allen to a Vallejo Ace Hardware store, where he is employed as a sales clerk; they stare at each other before Graysmith leaves. Eight years later, after Graysmith's book, Zodiac, has become a bestseller, Mike Mageau identifies Allen from a police mugshot. A textual epilogue says that Allen died before police could question him and that the case remains open.",

    "film_title": "A Christmas Tale",
    "Synopsis": "Roubaix, December 2006. Junon Vuillard, married to Abel, is the iron-willed matriarch of the family. Junon held her family together through tough times, but her willpower made her children resentful. She remains handsome, and though her husband is obese and elderly, he retains clarity, acceptance, tolerance, and unconditional love for his family. He and their mutual love holds a fragmented family together, albeit uneasily. They have three children in their 30s. The eldest is Elizabeth, a successful playwright married to the equally successful Claude. Their only child, 16-year-old Paul, is mentally ill and takes strong medication. The middle child is Henri, who drinks too much and has always fought with everyone else. He has a new girlfriend, Faunia. Ivan is the youngest sibling, married to Sylvia with two sons, Basile and Baptiste. Henri and Ivan are friends with Simon, a cousin who was raised with them after his parents' death. Simon works in Abel's plant, but is a part-time artist. He is an alcoholic, frequently in trouble for public brawling. All three men were interested in Sylvia once, but manipulated her to think that only Ivan loved her; she married and grew to love him. A deceased sibling, Joseph, is the presence around which everyone's psyches revolve: he died of leukemia at age six, after his parents tried to save him by having another child who might be a bone marrow donor. Six years before the family's latest Christmas gathering, Henri faced bankruptcy. Elizabeth paid off his debts, but demanded that he never see her again, meaning he had to be excluded from family gatherings. Family members speculate on the reason Elizabeth set this condition. Just before Christmas, Junon learns she has acute myeloid leukemia and will soon die unless she undergoes a bone marrow transplant. Her extended family gathers at her home and immediately start bickering. Junon has asked them to be tested to see if they qualify to donate their bone marrow. Elizabeth fights with Henri, who drinks heavily and hides Paul's medication. Paul fears the blood test might reveal Claude is not his biological father. Henri refuses the test, because he never loved his mother. Faunia has agreed to visit before leaving to spend the holiday with her own family. Her honesty and gentleness soothe Henri, and she stays for two days. On 23 December, Rosaimée visits for dinner and fireworks. She was Abel's mother's friend, although it is suggested that they were lesbian lovers. Rosaimée tells Sylvia that Simon stopped seeing Sylvia because he believed she would be happier with Ivan. Sylvia feels betrayed and manipulated. Henri is tested, discovers he qualifies as a donor, and decides he wants to. Simon begins drinking heavily in cafes, and the family searches for him. Sylvia finds him and confesses that she knows he loves her. She and Simon spend several hours talking, then return to the house and have sex. Paul tells Henri about his fears. Henri convinces him that he is not his father, confirmed by the test, and reassures Paul that it is not a failing to be afraid. They bond, and Paul's mental condition improves. On Christmas Day, Abel and Elizabeth discuss Elizabeth's longstanding depression, and Abel reads her the prologue to Friedrich Nietzsche's On the Genealogy of Morality, which discusses how well people know or do not know themselves. Abel suggests that Elizabeth fears death, and this has led to her caution and depression. Ivan discovers Sylvia has had sex with Simon. They made no effort to hide it, waking up together in bed and greeting her children as they come bearing tea. Ivan seems hardly to respond, as though he has expected it. Paul stays behind with Henri, who is having a positive effect on his mental health. Henri donates his bone marrow to Junon, but she announces her conviction that her body will reject the transplant. Elizabeth speculates that Junon will live, while Henri flips a coin in the hospital in front of his mother, but does not reveal the result.",

    "Synopsis": "High school French teacher Sabine reads to her class as a translation exercise a French newspaper report of a terrorist who planted a bomb in the airline luggage of his pregnant girlfriend. If the bomb had detonated, it would have killed her, her unborn child, and many others, but it was discovered in time by Israeli security personnel. Egoyan based the story partly on the 1986 Hindawi affair. In the course of translating, Simon, who lives with his maternal uncle Tom, imagines that the news item is his own family's story: that his Palestinian father Sami was the terrorist, the woman was his mother Rachel, an accomplished violinist, and he was her unborn child. Years ago, Sami crashed the family car, killing both himself and Rachel, making Simon an orphan. Influenced by his maternal grandfather, Morris, who disliked Sami, Simon has always feared that the crash was not an accident but intentional. Sabine asks him to develop the story as a drama exercise, to read it to the class, and for dramatic effect to pretend that it really happened. He does so, and discussions evolve on the Internet about the story. Sabine is fired for making Simon lie. Tom, who is a tow truck driver, tows Sabine's car away. Sabine follows him in a taxi, and by mobile phone she offers him a meal in a restaurant. Later she reveals to him that she had been married to Sami for 5 years, until Sami met Rachel.",

    "Synopsis": "The film begins with a young professional suddenly going blind in his car while at an intersection, with his field of vision turning white. A seemingly kind passerby offers to drive him home. However, he then steals the blind man's car. When the blind man's wife returns home, she takes him to an ophthalmologist who can identify nothing wrong and refers him for further evaluation. The next day, the doctor goes blind, and recognizes that the blindness must be caused by a communicable disease. Around the city, more citizens are struck blind, causing widespread panic, and the government organizes a quarantine for the blind in a derelict asylum. When a hazmat crew arrives to pick up the doctor, his wife lies that she has also gone blind in order to accompany him. In the asylum, the doctor and his wife are first to arrive and agree they will keep her sight a secret. They are joined by several others, including the driver, the thief, and other patients of the doctor. At this point, the \"white sickness\" has become international, with hundreds of cases reported every day. The government is resorting to increasingly ruthless measures to try to deal with the epidemic, including refusing aid to the blind. As more blinded people are crammed into what has become a concentration camp, overcrowding and lack of outside support cause hygiene and living conditions to quickly degrade. The doctor serves as the representative of his ward, and his sighted wife does what she can to assist her fellow inmates without revealing her ability. Anxiety over the availability of food undermines morale and introduces conflict between the prison's wards, as the soldiers who guard the camp become increasingly hostile. A man with a handgun appoints himself \"king\" of his ward, and takes control of the food deliveries, first demanding the other wards' valuables, and then for the women to have sex with their men. In an effort to obtain necessities, several women reluctantly submit to being raped. One of the women is killed by her assailant, and the doctor's wife retaliates, killing the \"king\" with a pair of scissors. Independently, other raped women sneak to the dead king's ward and set it on fire, which rapidly engulfs the building, with many inmates dying in the ensuing chaos. The survivors who escape the building discover that the guards have abandoned their posts, and they venture out into the city. Society has collapsed, with the city's population reduced to an aimless, zombie-like struggle to survive. The doctor's wife leads her husband and a few others from their ward in search of food and shelter. She discovers a well-stocked basement storeroom beneath a grocery store, barely escaping with aid from her husband when the throng around her smell the fresh food she is carrying. The doctor and his wife invite their new \"family\" to their apartment, where they establish a mutually supportive long-term home. Then, just as suddenly as his sight had been lost, the driver – the first person to lose his sight – recovers his sight, indicating that the body had fought off the disease, and that the blindness is ultimately temporary. They celebrate and their hope is restored.",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->In 1928 Los Angeles, single mother Christine Collins returns home to find her 9-year-old son, Walter, missing. Reverend Gustav Briegleb publicizes Christine's plight and rails against the LAPD for incompetence, corruption and the extrajudicial punishment meted out by its \"Gun Squad,\" led by Chief James E. Davis. Some five months later, the LAPD tells Christine that Walter has been found alive in Dekalb, Illinois, and organizes a reunion in Los Angeles in front of the press. Christine immediately realizes that the boy is not Walter. Captain J.J. Jones, the head of the LAPD's Juvenile Division, insists he is and pressures Christine into taking him home \"on a trial basis.\" Christine finds several physical characteristics proving the boy is not her son. Unlike Walter, he is circumcised and is about four inches shorter, in comparison to Walter’s growth chart. Jones produces a doctor who tells her that trauma has shrunk his spine, and whoever took Walter must have had him circumcised. Christine pleads with Jones to continue the search for Walter, but he chastises her and suggests that she is pretending the boy is not Walter so that she can be free of her parental responsibilities. A newspaper story later implies that Christine is an unfit mother; Briegleb says it was planted by police to discredit her. Walter's teacher and dentist both sign letters asserting that the boy is not Walter. When Christine tells her story to the press, Jones has her committed to Los Angeles County Hospital's psychiatric ward. Inmate Carol tells Christine she is one of several women sent there for challenging police authority. Dr. Jonathan Steele diagnoses Christine as delusional, forces her to take medication, and says he will only release her if she signs an admission that she was mistaken about Walter's identity. Detective Lester Ybarra travels to a ranch in Wineville to deport 15-year-old Sanford Clark to Canada. Clark's uncle, Gordon Stewart Northcott, has fled. Clark tells Ybarra that Northcott forced him to help kidnap and murder about twenty young boys. He identifies Walter as one of them and digs up body parts. Briegleb secures Christine's release with a newspaper story naming Walter as a possible victim in the Wineville killings. After questioning, the boy impersonating Walter admits that his real identity is Arthur Hutchens, a 12-year-old runaway from Cedar Rapids, Iowa. He reveals that the LA police told him to lie about being Christine's son. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police captures Northcott in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Famed attorney Sammy \"S.S.\" Hahn takes on Christine's case pro bono and secures the release of the other women whom the LAPD wanted to silence. Christine, Hahn, and Briegleb arrive at Los Angeles City Hall for the city council's hearing, where crowds are protesting. The council concludes that Jones and Davis must be removed from duty and that extrajudicial internments by police must stop. The jury finds Northcott guilty of murder, and the court judge sentences him to death by hanging. In 1930, Northcott sends Christine a message saying that if she visits him, he will admit to killing Walter. When she visits, Northcott refuses to tell her. He is executed the next day. In 1935, David Clay, assumed to have been one of those murdered, is found alive. He reveals that he was imprisoned with Walter and that Walter helped him escape. They became separated, and David does not know if Walter was recaptured, but Christine gains hope that he could still be alive. Epilogue text states that Captain Jones was suspended, Chief Davis was demoted, and Mayor George Cryer did not run for re-election; that California made it illegal to commit people to psychiatric facilities based solely on the word of authorities; that Rev. Briegleb continued to use his radio show to expose police misconduct and political corruption; that Wineville changed its name to Mira Loma to escape the stigma of the murders; and that Christine Collins never stopped searching for her son.",

    "film_title": "Che (2008 film)",
    "Synopsis": "In Havana in 1964, Che Guevara is interviewed by Lisa Howard who asks him if reform throughout Latin America might not blunt the \"message of the Cuban Revolution\". In 1955, at a gathering in Mexico City, Guevara first meets Fidel Castro. He listens to Castro's plans and signs on as a member of the July 26th Movement. There is a return to 1964 for Guevara's address before the United Nations General Assembly in New York City, where he makes an impassioned speech against American imperialism, and defends the executions his regime has committed, declaring \"this is a battle to the death.\" March 1957. Guevara deals with debilitating bouts of asthma as his group of revolutionaries meet up with Castro's. Together, they attack an army barracks in the Sierra Maestra on 28 May 1957. After that, they begin to win over the rural peasant population of Cuba and receive increasing support, while battling both the government and traitors in their midst. Gradually, the government loses control of most of the rural areas. Soon afterward, the 26 July Movement forges alliances with other revolutionary movements in Cuba, and begins to assault towns and villages. Most fall to the rebels with little to no resistance. On 15 October 1958, the guerrillas approach the town of Las Villas. The Battle of Santa Clara is depicted with Guevara demonstrating his tactical skill as the guerrillas engage in street-to-street fighting and derail a train carrying Cuban soldiers and armaments. Near the film's end, they are victorious. With the Cuban Revolution now over, Guevara heads to Havana, remarking, \"we won the war, the revolution starts now.\" The second part begins on 3 November 1966 with Guevara arriving in La Paz, Bolivia, disguised as a middle-aged representative of the Organization of American States hailing from Uruguay, who subsequently drives into the mountains to meet his men. The film is organized by the number of days that he was in the country. On Day 26, there is solidarity among Guevara's men despite his status as a foreigner. By Day 67, Guevara, however, has been set up for betrayal. He tries to recruit some peasants only to be mistaken for a cocaine smuggler, and the Bolivian Communist Party, led by Mario Monje, refuse to support the armed struggle. On Day 100, there is a shortage of food and Guevara exercises discipline to resolve conflicts between his Cuban and Bolivian followers. By Day 113, some of the guerrillas have deserted, and, upon capture, have led the Bolivian Army to the revolutionaries' base camp, which contained vast stockpiles of food, much-needed supplies, and intelligence identifying much of the group as Cubans. Much to Che's disappointment, Tamara \"Tania\" Bunke, Guevara's revolutionary contact has botched elaborate preparations and given away their identity. On Day 141, the guerrillas capture Bolivian soldiers that refuse to join the revolution, but soon free them so they can return to their villages. Bolivian President and dictator René Barrientos calls upon the United States for help. CIA and US Army Special Forces advisers arrive in Bolivia to supervise anti-insurgent activity and to train the Bolivian Army. On Day 169, Guevara's visiting friend, the French intellectual Régis Debray, is captured at Muyupampa by the Bolivian Army along with two of Che's last contacts with the outside world. A Bolivian airstrike then occurs against Che's guerrillas on Day 219, driving them deeper into hiding. By this time, Che has split his forces; his best fighters travel with him in one column, while another column contains other personnel, including Tania, and carries much of the remaining supplies. Guevara grows sick and by Day 280 can barely breathe as a result of his acute asthma. Nevertheless, he continues to lead his group towards the other column of revolutionaries. On Day 302, the Bolivian Army wipes out the other column, killing Tania Bunke, Juan Acuña Ñunez, and several others in an ambush as they attempt to cross the Vado del Yeso after a local informant tells the Bolivian troops about the movements of the rebels. By Day 340, Guevara is trapped by the Bolivian Army in the Yuro Ravine near the village of La Higuera. Che is wounded and captured. The next day, a helicopter lands and Cuban American CIA agent Alejandro Ramírez (a fictionalized version of Félix Rodríguez) emerges to interrogate Che, but without success. The Bolivian high command then phones and orders Guevara's execution (using the code 'Order 600'). He is shot to death by a half-drunk Bolivian army sergeant on 9 October 1967, and his corpse lashed to a helicopter's landing skids and flown out. In a final flashback scene, Guevara is aboard the Granma in 1956, looking out over the ocean, as the Cuban Revolution is about to begin. He sees the Castro brothers alone at the bow of the ship; Fidel is talking and Raúl is taking notes. Guevara hands a peeled orange to one of his comrades and returns his gaze to the lone brothers before the scene fades to black.",

    "Synopsis": "In Naples in 2004, some gangsters are relaxing in a tanning salon. An assassination occurs between clans of the Di Lauro Camorra syndicate which rule Scampia–Secondigliano, and triggers the Scampia feud, between members of the Di Lauro syndicate and the so-called scissionisti (secessionists), who are led by Raffaele Amato, brother of two of the men killed in the opening scene. The film intertwines five separate stories of people whose lives are touched by organized crime against the backdrop of the ongoing feud. Don Ciro<br>Don Ciro is a timid middleman who distributes money to the families of imprisoned Di Lauro clan members. After the feud develops within the clan, he is ambushed by a pair of angry secessionists during a delivery. Fearing for his life, he later offers to defect to their side. They refuse his offer, and tell Ciro that he has to \"pay\" for his life by selling some of his former associates. He leads them to the location where he is given the money for distribution. The pair raid the place, killing everyone but Ciro, and take most of the money, leaving some cash on the table for Ciro. Ciro, spattered with blood, walks off past several bodies to an uncertain future. Totò<br>Totò is a 13-year-old grocery delivery boy who witnesses some drug dealers abandon a bag of drugs and a gun while evading the police in the Vele of Scampia. He returns the items to the gang, and asks to join. His initiation in a cavern consists of him being shot while wearing a bulletproof vest as a test of courage. As the feud intensifies, families in the neighborhood whose loyalties are suspect are ordered to move out or suffer violence; Totò's fellow gang members receive similar threats. Later, while hanging out with his gang in the streets of Scampia, one of his gang is killed in a drive-by shooting. The gang members decide to stand their ground and exact violent retribution by selecting a woman, Maria, as their next victim, as her son has joined a clan of Secondigliano secessionists. Totò, who has delivered groceries to Maria, is forced to lure her out of her apartment, where his comrades kill her. Roberto<br>Roberto is a graduate who works in waste management. His boss, Franco, provides a low-cost toxic waste disposal service that allows northern industrialists to dispose of materials like chromium and asbestos in the countryside of southern Italy. Franco and Roberto orchestrate the illegal disposal of the waste at abandoned quarries and other environmentally-sensitive sites. During one such operation, a drum of toxic chemicals is accidentally spilled on a driver. Franco refuses to call an ambulance, and hires children to drive the trucks when the workers refuse to continue their work. Later, Franco and Roberto meet a family of farmers who, desperate to extinguish their debts, decide to allow the burial of chemical substances in their countryside. An elderly farmer gifts Roberto a basket of peaches, but Franco later tells him to throw them away because they are contaminated. Roberto then decides to quit his job and tells Franco he cannot bring himself to poison the earth, to which Franco says that he should not think he is the better man, because thanks to men like them Italy was able to join the European Union by solving problems others had caused, and allowed people to repay their debts. Roberto walks alone on a desolate countryside road. Pasquale<br>Pasquale is an haute couture tailor who works for Iavarone, a garment factory owner with ties to the Camorra. Pasquale takes a night-job training Chinese garment workers. As they are competing with Camorra-controlled firms, the Chinese drive him to and from work in the trunk of their car. His secret work is discovered, and his Chinese associates are killed in a drive-by shooting. He survives the attack, but resigns his job. Later, working as a truck driver, he is in a transport café where he spots Scarlett Johansson on TV wearing one of his dresses. He smiles wryly as he drives away. Marco and Ciro<br>Marco and Ciro are two young wannabe-gangsters who try to operate their own small racket independently of the local clan. Impressed by mafia portrayals from Hollywood movies, they quote lines and spontaneously reenact scenes from Scarface in Walter Schiavone's villa while dropping references to Tony Montana, Miami, and Colombian drug cartels. Their first score is robbing African immigrants during a drug purchase at the Hotel Boomerang, Castel Volturno. The word of the incident gets to the local mob chieftain, who summons them and warns them under threat of violence not to repeat such behavior in the future. Ignoring him completely, they spy Camorra gangsters hiding a stash of weapons. They steal the weapons and amuse themselves by firing off rounds by the banks of a Regi Lagni canal estuary in the marshland. Once they run out of money, they use their guns to rob a video arcade, and spend their stolen funds at a strip club. The gangsters, angered, find them and threaten to kill them if they do not return the weapons within a day. The pair prove stubborn. Zio Vittorio, one of the local gangsters, approaches them in a bar with an offer to work for him. He offers them €10,000 if they return the weapons and murder Peppe 'O Cavallaro. They accept the contract, which turns out to be a trap: they are ambushed and killed by Giovanni, Bernardino, Vittorio and others at the location of their supposed target, an abandoned beach resort next to Regi Lagni canal estuary. The last scene shows their dead bodies being carried away by a front end loader.",

    "Synopsis": "Lorna, a young Albanian woman living in Belgium, is in a sham marriage with a drug addict named Claudy. She dreams of owning a snack bar with her boyfriend, Sokol, and agrees to have another fake marriage with a Russian man to earn the money for it. Fabio, a petty criminal who orchestrated the whole plan, pressures Lorna to kill Claudy via an overdose. Moved by Claudy's determination to stay clean, Lorna pleads with Fabio to hold off with the plan. In order to obtain a quick divorce, Lorna decides to hurt herself and make it look like Claudy abused her. After a second attempt where she enlists a nurse at a drug rehabilitation clinic to act as the witness, she receives approval for the divorce, while Claudy gets out of the hospital. She asks Fabio to wait a month before she has to marry the Russian. At home, she kicks out a drug dealer who almost tempted Claudy into a relapse, has sex with Claudy and reconciles with him. The next day, Lorna and Claudy agree that she will help him stay clean. After a time skip, Lorna is seen collecting Claudy's possessions in his apartment and from a morgue worker, revealing that Claudy was killed, though Fabio made it look like an overdose, supposedly thanks to \"Lorna's silence\". Fabio claims the murder was necessary as the Russian man was growing impatient and offers Lorna an extra thousand euro for putting up with Claudy. While Fabio and his accomplice Spirou leave, Lorna is interrogated by two detectives. Afterward, Lorna makes plans to open up the bar with Sokol and has a meeting with the Russian man, taking more money from Fabio, including the thousand she refused prior. Feeling ill, she suspects that she is pregnant and visits the hospital to get an abortion but backs out. Fabio pressures her to go through with it but she refuses, trying to open a bank account for her unborn child, giving Claudy's last name when asked for information. During a second meeting with the Russian, she reveals her pregnancy and he tells her the baby is out of the question. Fabio later accosts Lorna and tells her he will take her to get an abortion, after which Lorna clutches her stomach in pain. Later, at the hospital, the doctor insists that Lorna is not pregnant but asks her to stay in the hospital overnight. Fabio realizes that he can no longer use Lorna, meets up with her and Sokol and takes back most of the money he had given her. The next day, Lorna packs up her possessions and Fabio takes away her SIM card, sending her off with Spirou. In the car, Lorna asks Spirou why he has not taken the highway, as he claims that he needs a gas station, yet passes one on the way. Realizing that Spirou intends to kill her, she asks him to stop the car so she can pee. Lorna grabs a rock while she's urinating and hits Spirou in the head with it, running off into the woods. The movie ends as Lorna arrives at a cabin in the woods where she decides to spend the night. She goes out to find firewood and talks to her imaginary baby, telling it that she will not let it die the way she did with Claudy.",

    "Synopsis": "Theater director Caden Cotard finds his life unraveling. He suffers from mysterious physical ailments and has been growing increasingly alienated from his artist wife, Adele, who creates microscopic paintings. He hits bottom when their couple's therapy fails as Adele leaves him for a new life in Berlin, taking their four-year-old daughter, Olive. After Caden's successful production of Death of a Salesman, he unexpectedly receives a MacArthur Fellowship, giving him the financial means to pursue a new theatrical project on a gigantic scale. He decides to create a play of brutal realism and honesty that will span years and into which he can pour his whole self. Gathering an ensemble cast into an enormous warehouse in Manhattan's Theater District, he directs a celebration of the mundane, instructing the cast to live out their roles in real time. As the mockup stage inside the warehouse grows increasingly mimetic of the city outside, Caden continues to seek solutions to his personal crises. He is traumatized to discover that Adele has become a world-famous painter in Berlin and has given Olive a full-body tattoo. Following a failed attempt at a fling with his box office employee, Hazel, Caden instead marries a leading actress in his cast, Claire, and has a daughter with her, though reality is blurred as he refers to Olive alone as his \"real daughter\". His and Claire's relationship fails, and he continues his awkward friendship with Hazel, while still harboring feelings for her across the years. Hazel lives in a house that is constantly on fire and filled with smoke. She marries and has her own children, eventually coming back to work as Caden's assistant. Meanwhile, an unknown condition is gradually shutting down Caden's autonomic nervous system, so he has to walk with a cane. As the decades pass, the continually expanding warehouse is isolated from the slow decline of the city outside. Caden buries himself ever deeper into his magnum opus, further muddying the line between reality and the world of the play by populating both the cast and crew with doppelgängers. For instance, he hires a man named Sammy to play the role of Caden himself after Sammy reveals that he has been obsessively following Caden for 20 years. (Eventually, a Sammy lookalike is cast as Sammy.) In one scene, Caden is mistaken for Ellen, the housekeeper of his absent first wife Adele's apartment, and he passively takes the role, regularly scrubbing objects in the model of her apartment. In other scenes whose fictionality is unclear, Caden meets with the now-adult Olive, who works as an erotic dancer; finally, she demands that he ask forgiveness for abandoning her as she lies on her deathbed as a result of her tattoo becoming infected. He also lives through his parents' deaths and begins a short-lived affair with Hazel's doppelgänger. Sammy begins to romantically pursue Hazel, which simultaneously sparks a revival of Caden's own relationship with her, but this makes Sammy feel spurned. Mirroring an earlier moment where Caden nearly jumped off a building in anguish, Sammy now jumps to his death off one of the many buildings inside the warehouse. Caden and Hazel finally enter into a full romantic relationship, but Hazel soon dies of smoke inhalation in her constantly burning house. As Caden becomes ever older and feebler, he continues to push against the limits of his relationships in his work and private lives. One day, the actress he hires to play the housekeeper Ellen offers to take over his role as director so that he can fully commit to the role of Ellen, which relieves him of his many professional duties and stresses. She soon presents him with an earpiece she instructed him to leave in permanently. Through the earpiece, she directs his every move as he lives out his days cleaning Adele's apartment. The world outside the warehouse deteriorates into chaos until some unexplained calamity leaves the warehouse in ruins, with the corpses of his cast and crew strewn around the massive set. Finally, Caden prepares to die as he rests his head on the shoulder of an actress who had previously played Ellen's mother, seemingly the only other person in the warehouse still alive. As the scene fades to gray, Caden realizes that he has a new idea for how to perform the play, but the director's voice in his ear cuts him off with his final cue: \"Die\".",

    "Synopsis": "Set entirely in a secondary school in a working-class district of Paris, where most residents are first-generation immigrants to France born overseas, the film follows the year of a young teacher, François Marin, and the 25 pupils aged 14-15 years whom he takes for an hour each day for French lessons. A loner, he walks the narrow line between maintaining discipline and gaining co-operation. From the start, wide differences are apparent in the class over standards of dress, deportment, knowledge, and application. A dispute arises over using the imperfect and pluperfect subjunctive, which he admits may be a bit of an affectation and a student questions whether François is gay. When pupils have to read aloud from The Diary of Anne Frank, a girl called Khoumba refuses because she does not consider it relevant to her life. In private, François forces her to apologise. Success comes when he asks the pupils to write a self-portrait. An assertive girl called Esmeralda reveals that she would like to be a policewoman or failing that, a rapper. A difficult boy called Souleymane, weak in written French, submits his story in an interesting series of photographs (at a parents' evening, his mother cannot speak French at all). However, after an argument over football teams with Will, another boy who is problematic, Souleymane insults François and is sent to the head teacher's office. At a teachers' conference to decide final placings, François defends Souleymane but his efforts are undermined by the two student representatives at the meeting, Esmeralda and Louise, who behave in a very childish manner. During the next class, despite the confidential nature of the teachers' conference, the two girls tell the others that François had it in for Souleymane. A furious François rebukes the pair, saying they behaved like \"skanks\" ( ). Uproar follows, in which Souleymane, after accidentally hitting Khoumba with his backpack, storms out and is suspended. Later, Khoumba pulls aside François, telling him that if Souleymane is expelled, his father may send him back to his native country, Mali, as punishment. After a disciplinary hearing at which Souleymane is supported by his mother, for whom he has to translate, he is ultimately expelled. In the last lesson of the year, François asks each pupil what they have learned over the year. Carl has been inspired by science experiments in his chemistry class, Khoumba has warmed to music and enjoyed learning Spanish, Esmerelda professes to have learned nothing in school but then admits that she has read Plato's Republic in her free time. After they have all left the room, a quiet girl called Henriette comes back and despondently claims that she really has not learned anything at all. Outside, an impromptu football match has begun between the pupils and teachers.",

    "Synopsis": "This film is centered around Verónica (\"Vero\"), an Argentine bourgeois woman, and how her life slowly twists out of control after she thinks perhaps she struck and killed a person with her car. As Vero is driving, she is distracted by her cell phone and, as she looks down to answer it, her car hits something. She peers in the rear-view mirror, collects herself, and drives away. A non-point-of-view shot of Véro driving away from the scene shows a dog lying dead on the ground. Although Vero seems indifferent about the situation, it is clear that the incident deeply disturbs her. She acts clumsy and out of place. When she informs her husband Marcos that she thinks she may have run over someone, she insists upon returning to the scene of the accident; they see something on the side of the road, which her husband insists is merely a dog, though Vero is even more unsure than before. Later, the body of a dark-skinned servant's child is recovered from a canal, right above the spot where the accident occurred. Her niece Candita, who has a crush on Vero, tells her that she wants to know more about \"that boy who was murdered,\" but Vero insists that the boy was drowned: \"The papers say he was drowned.\" Still privately unconvinced, in an attempt to jog back her memory after the accident, Vero revisits a hospital where she had X-rays taken and a hotel where she had a post-accident tryst with her lover Juan Manuel. She discovers that there are no records of her visits to a hospital (scrubbed by her brother, who works there) and the hotel where she stayed (perhaps scrubbed by Juan Manuel). Finally, she attends a bourgeois party in a hotel, smiling weakly and dazedly as people enter in and out of the busy frame.",

    "Synopsis": "In summary, a family is dislocated when small failings become extravagant lies. The film opens with a wealthy businessman, Servet, campaigning in the upcoming election, driving in his car on a wet night, alone, sleepy and struggling to keep his eyes open. Seconds later, he hits and kills a pedestrian in the middle of the road. Servet panics when another car with a couple inside stops briefly and drives away. Eyüp, Servet's normal driver, lives with his wife and son next to the railroad tracks in the poor coastal Yedikule neighborhood of Istanbul. He is woken in the night by his cell phone ringing. It is Servet, telling him to meet up immediately. When they meet, Servet, shivering in shock, explains the situation. If his role in the fatal accident becomes public, it would end his political career, so he asks Eyüp to take responsibility and serve the consequent prison sentence, which he thinks will be 6-12 months. In exchange Servet will give him a lump sum payment upon his release and pay his salary while he is in jail to his family so they can get by. Eyüp accepts the deal. An unspecified time passes, summer arrives, and Eyüp's son, İsmail, fails his college entrance exam again. His mother, Hacer, who works as a kitchen assistant, starts worrying about him because of his dubious acquaintances and his injuries from fighting and tries to convince him to get a job. İsmail suggests driving children between home and school but, as they don't have funds for a car, İsmail asks his mother to seek an advance from the lump sum from Servet without consulting Eyüp. Hacer meets with Servet in his office after the election (which he lost), and requests the money. After Hacer leaves and is waiting for a bus at the stop, Servet persuades Hacer to accept a lift from him back to her home, which she very reluctantly accepts. More unspecified time passes; İsmail finds out his mother is having an affair with Servet and confronts her but does not tell his father. After serving nine months in prison, Eyüp is released. He senses things are \"a little peculiar\" inside his home. Hacer is in love with Servet and wants to continue their affair but Servet refuses. That night, Hacer and Eyüp are invited to the police station and informed that Servet has been murdered. Police officers interrogate the two and Eyüp finds out that Hacer was cheating on him. He denies knowing anything about it. İsmail confesses to his mother that he murdered Servet. Eyüp calms down when he pays a visit to a mosque. Afterwards, Eyüp goes on to speak with a very poor man who works and sleeps inside a tea house in the neighborhood. Eyüp makes the same proposition to the poor man, Bayram, that Servet made to him: to claim the crime committed by his son.",

    "Synopsis": "Leonard Kraditor walks along a bridge over a stream in Brooklyn before jumping into the water in an attempted suicide. He changes his mind and quickly walks to the home where he resides with his parents. His mother Ruth, seeing him dripping wet, tells her husband Reuben their son has tried it again and it becomes evident that Leonard has attempted suicide before. His parents tell him that a potential business partner and his family are invited for dinner that night and ask him to be present. When they arrive, Leonard finds that he had been set up with the other family's daughter, Sandra Cohen. She inquires about his interest in photography and notices a photo of a girl above his headboard. He explains he had been engaged to the girl for several years, but the relationship was broken off when it turned out both he and his fiancée carried the gene for Tay–Sachs disease, which results in diseased children who generally do not live beyond the age of five years, so they would be unable to have healthy children. Leonard meets a new neighbor, Michelle Rausch, and is immediately attracted to her, choosing to ignore that she is a drug addict. He learns that she is dating a married partner in the law firm where he, Ronald Blatt, practices. At her request, Leonard agrees to meet the pair for dinner at a restaurant. The couple leave him later that evening, as they have plans to attend the Metropolitan Opera. Leonard returns home dejected, but Sandra arrives, sent over by Leonard's parents. Believing that Leonard wanted her to come by, she realizes by his shocked expression that she was set up. She apologizes for the misunderstanding and says that, if he is not interested, a lot of other guys are. Leonard says that he likes her, and they kiss and eventually have sex. With time, his relationship with Sandra deepens. Michelle calls Leonard and says she is sick. He takes her to the hospital, where she has a D&C for a miscarriage. She had been unaware she was pregnant and is even more angry that Ronald ignored her calls. Leonard takes her home but hides when Ronald arrives unexpectedly. Ronald apologizes to Michelle for not having come to her aid. Michelle asks Ronald to leave and then asks Leonard to write something on her forearm with his finger while she falls asleep. Leonard writes \"I love you\". Two weeks later, Michelle meets Leonard on the roof of their building and tells him that she has broken up with Ronald and is going to San Francisco. Leonard tells her not to leave and professes his love for her. They have sex and plan to leave together the next day for San Francisco. On New Year's Eve, Leonard buys an engagement ring for Michelle. Sandra's father Michael then summons him and offers him a partnership in the family businesses, assuming that he is going to marry Sandra. Noticing the jeweler's gift bag Leonard is holding, the father assumes it is for Sandra; Leonard lies that it is. During his parents' New Year's Eve party, Leonard hides in the courtyard to meet Michelle. Michelle arrives late and tells Leonard that she is not going to San Francisco, because Ronald, having learned that Michelle is leaving him for California, has decided to leave his wife and children for her. Disheartened, Leonard permanently breaks things off with her. Feeling depressed, Leonard heads to the beach, intending to kill himself. When he drops a glove that Sandra had bought for him, he realizes that, in Sandra, he has found someone who loves him and with whom he can build a happy life. He picks up the glove and sees the boxed engagement ring lying on the sand, where he had thrown it from the boardwalk moments before. He returns to the party, where he gives Sandra the ring and embraces her in a tearful passionate hug.",

    "Synopsis": "In 2006, Ari Folman meets with Boaz, an old friend who tells Ari he is being haunted by a recurrent nightmare in which 26 rabidly angry dogs run toward his home through the streets of Tel Aviv, destroying everything in their way. Boaz explains that, during the 1982 Lebanon War, the other soldiers in his unit knew he would not be able to kill a human, so they gave him the job of killing the dogs when they infiltrated a village at night so the animals would not alert the villagers to their presence, and he vividly remembers each of the 26 dogs he killed. Ari is surprised to find that, although he had also fought in the conflict during his stint as an infantry soldier in the Israel Defense Forces, he recalls nothing of his deployment. Troubled by this, later that night he has a vision of his younger self and two other soldiers bathing at night in the Mediterranean just off the coast of Beirut under the light of flares descending over the city. He recognizes the vision as being connected to the Sabra and Shatila massacre, but he cannot remember enough to put this fragment in context. Early the next morning, Ari rushes off to see a childhood friend, who is a professional therapist. His friend advises him to seek out others who were in Beirut at the time of the massacre to gain a better understanding of what happened and, hopefully, revive his own memories. The friend further explains that, given the nature of human memory, the vision might not be an exact record of what actually occurred, though it certainly relates to matters of great importance to Ari's inner world. Ari interviews friends and other soldiers who fought in the war, as well as a psychologist specializing in PTSD and Israeli TV reporter Ron Ben-Yishai, who was in Beirut covering the war when the massacre took place. Eventually, Ari's memories start to come back into focus, and he remembers that he \"was in the second or third ring\" of soldiers in the city, as his unit fired flares into the sky at night in support of the Israeli-allied Lebanese Christian Phalange militia while they perpetrated the massacre in retaliation for the assassination of Bachir Gemayel. While he did not know what the militia was up to until after they were finished, he concludes that the holes in his memory were a defense mechanism, as his younger self had felt as responsible for the massacre as those who actually carried it out. The film ends with the animation dissolving into actual news footage of the aftermath of the massacre.",

    "Synopsis": "Malik El Djebena, a 19-year-old of Maghrebi descent, is sentenced to six years in prison for attacking police officers. Alone and illiterate upon his arrival, he falls under the sway of Corsican mobsters, led by César Luciani, who enforces a brutal rule. The prison is divided between two main factions: the Corsicans and the Maghrebis. Malik keeps to himself. When Luciani forces him to be the unwilling assassin of Reyeb, a Maghrebi witness in a trial, Malik gains the protection of the Corsicans despite his North African origin. Malik serves as a low-level servant to the Corsicans, who treat him with disdain. All the while, he is haunted by visions of the murdered Reyeb. When most of the Corsicans are transferred or released, Luciani is forced to give Malik more responsibility. Having secretly learned Corsican, Malik acts as Luciani's eyes and ears in the prison. When Malik earns the privilege of day-long furloughs outside the prison, Luciani relies on him to conduct Luciani's criminal business outside. Ryad, a Maghrebi friend, teaches Malik to read and write, and the two become close. Ryad teaches Malik about his own heritage, introducing him to two other Maghrebis, Tarik and Hassan, and increases his power within the prison. Malik also becomes involved with a prison drug dealer, Jordi. When Ryad gains an early release due to testicular cancer, the three partners organize a drug-running enterprise to sell hashish. But when Ryad is kidnapped by the drug dealer Latif, Malik tracks down Latif's relative inside the prison. He kidnaps the relative's family and forces Latif's gang to release Ryad. When Luciani discovers that Malik is using his day-releases for his own personal enterprise, he punishes him by pressing a spoon against his eye. Later on, Malik is sent by César to meet Brahim Lattrache in Marseille, another Maghrebi, who is involved in a deal between Luciani and the Lingherris, an Italian mafia group. Lattrache is bitter toward the Corsicans for the murder of Reyeb and holds Malik at gunpoint. When Malik spots a deer warning sign, he remembers a recent dream of deer running in the road. He tells his kidnappers that they are in danger of hitting wild animals, and they suddenly strike a deer. Lattrache is impressed by Malik, calling him a prophet and agreeing to conduct criminal business with him instead of Luciani, even though Malik admitted that he killed Reyeb. Luciani believes there is a \"mole\" in his organization and decides to use Malik to assassinate Jacky Marcaggi, the don of the Corsican mafia, for secretly dealing with the Lingherris. But Malik and Ryad have their own plan for Marcaggi: they kill his bodyguards, kidnap him, and tell him that it was Luciani who ordered the hit before abandoning him in the city. Malik takes refuge at Ryad's house. The friend's cancer has returned: Ryad's decision to forego more chemotherapy leaves him just six months to live. He gets Malik to promise to take care of his family (wife and young son) when he's gone. Upon Malik's return to prison, he is placed in solitary for returning late on purpose - putting him temporarily out of reach of Luciani's retribution - while Marcaggi uses his influence to wipe out Luciani's faction. Once back in general population, Malik joins the Maghrebi faction in the yard as their new leader. When a now powerless Luciani tries to approach him, two Maghrebis intercept and beat him. On the day of his release, Malik is met by Ryad's wife and son outside the prison. They walk off together, followed by a convoy of vehicles carrying Malik's new associates.",

    "Synopsis": "An unnamed couple have sex in their Seattle apartment while their unsupervised infant son, Nic, climbs up to the bedroom window and falls out of it to his death. The mother collapses at the funeral and spends the next month in the hospital crippled with atypical grief. The father, a therapist, is skeptical of the psychiatric care she is receiving and takes it upon himself to treat her personally with psychotherapy. She reveals that her second greatest fear is nature, prompting him to try exposure therapy. They hike to their isolated cabin in the woods, called Eden, where she spent time with Nic the previous summer while writing a thesis criticizing gynocide. During the hike, he encounters a deer that shows no fear of him and has a stillborn fawn hanging halfway out of her. During sessions of psychotherapy, the woman becomes increasingly grief-stricken and manic, often demanding forceful sex. The area becomes increasingly sinister to the man; acorns rapidly pelt the metal roof, he wakes up with a hand covered in ticks that have fed on his blood, and he encounters a self-disemboweling red fox that tells him \"chaos reigns.\" In the dark attic, the man finds the woman's thesis studies, which include violent portraits of witch hunts and a scrapbook in which her writing becomes increasingly frantic and illegible. She reveals that, while writing, she came to believe that all women are inherently evil. The man reprimands her for this and, in a frenzied moment, they have violent sex at the base of an ominous dead tree where bodies are intertwined within the exposed roots. He suspects that Satan is her greatest hidden fear. Upon viewing Nic's autopsy and photos the woman took of him while they stayed at Eden, the man becomes aware that she had been systematically putting Nic's shoes on the wrong feet, resulting in a foot deformity. She attacks him in the shed, accuses him of planning to leave her, initiates sex with him, and then smashes a large block of wood onto his erect penis, causing him to lose consciousness. She then masturbates him until he ejaculates blood. She drills a hole through his leg, bolting a heavy grindstone through the wound, and tosses the wrench she used under the cabin. The man awakens alone; unable to loosen the bolt, he hides by dragging himself into a deep foxhole at the base of the dead tree. Following the sound of a crow he found buried alive in the hole, the woman locates and attacks him before partially burying him. Night falls. Now remorseful, the woman digs up the man but cannot remember where the wrench is. She helps him back to the cabin, where she tells him that only \"when the Three Beggars arrive\" can he die. The woman recounts that she saw Nic climbing up to the window on the night of his death and intentionally allowed him to fall from it, displaying her perceived evil. In the cabin, she cuts off her clitoris. The two are then visited by the crow (symbol of despair), the deer (symbol of grief), and the fox (symbol of pain), referred to as the Three Beggars. A hailstorm begins; it was earlier revealed that women accused of witchcraft had been known to have the power to summon hailstorms. When he finds the wrench under the cabin's floorboards, she attacks him with scissors, but he manages to unbolt the grindstone. Finally free, he strangles her to death then builds a pyre, lighting it to cremate her body. The man limps from the cabin and eats wild berries, as the Three Beggars look on, now translucent and glowing. Under a brilliant light, the man reaches the top of a hill and watches in awe as a procession of hundreds of women wearing antiquated clothing and with their faces blurred approach him before walking past, continuing to walk deeper into the forest.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1818 Hampstead, the fashionable Fanny Brawne is introduced to poet John Keats through the Dilke family. The Dilkes occupy one half of a double house, with Charles Brown occupying the other half. Brown is Keats' friend, housemate, and associate in writing. Fanny's flirtatious personality contrasts with Keats' notably more aloof nature. She begins to pursue him after her siblings Samuel and Toots obtain his book of poetry, \"Endymion\". Her efforts to interact with the poet are fruitless until he witnesses her grief for the loss of his brother, Tom. Keats begins to open up to her advances while spending Christmas with the Brawne family. He begins giving her poetry lessons, and it becomes apparent that their attraction is mutual. Fanny is nevertheless troubled by his reluctance to pursue her, as to which her mother surmises, \"Mr. Keats knows he cannot like you, he has no living and no income.\" It is only after Fanny receives a valentine card from Brown that Keats passionately confronts them and asks if they are lovers. Brown sent the valentine in jest, but warns Keats that Fanny is a mere flirt playing a game. Fanny is hurt by Brown's accusations and Keats' lack of faith in her; she ends their lessons and leaves. The Dilkes move to Westminster in the spring, leaving the Brawne family their half of the house and six months rent. Fanny and Keats then resume their interaction and fall deeply in love. The relationship comes to an abrupt end when Brown departs with Keats for his summer holiday, where Keats may earn some money. Fanny is heartbroken, though she is comforted by Keats' love letters. When the men return in the autumn, Fanny's mother voices her concern that Fanny's attachment to the poet will hinder her from being courted by a more obviously eligible suitor. Fanny and Keats secretly become engaged. Keats contracts tuberculosis the following winter. He spends several weeks recovering until spring. His friends collect funds so that he may spend the following winter in Italy, where the climate is warmer. After Brown impregnates a maid and is unable to accompany him, Keats finds accommodation in London for the summer, and is later taken in by the Brawne family following an attack of his illness. When his book sells with moderate success, Fanny's mother gives him her blessing to marry Fanny once he returns from Italy. The night before he leaves, he and Fanny say their tearful goodbyes in privacy. Keats dies in Italy the following February of complications from his illness, as his brother Tom had done. In the last moments of the film, Fanny cuts her hair in an act of mourning, dons black attire, and walks the snowy paths that Keats had walked many times. It is there that she recites the love sonnet that he had written for her, called \"Bright Star\", as she grieves the death of her lover.",

    "Synopsis": "\"Harry Caine\" is a blind writer who shares his life with his agent Judit and her adult son, Diego. Slowly, events in the present begin to bring back memories of the past. Harry hears that millionaire Ernesto Martel has died; a young filmmaker, Ray X, appears and turns out to be Martel's son, Ernesto Jr. After Diego is hospitalized for an accidental drug overdose in a Madrid nightclub, Harry collects Diego from the hospital and looks after him to avoid worrying his traveling mother. The main storyline is told in flashback as Harry reluctantly tells Diego a tragic tale of fate, jealousy, abuse of power, betrayal, and guilt. The first flashback is to 1992, which introduces Magdalena \"Lena\" Rivero, Martel's beautiful young secretary, an aspiring actress. She becomes close to Martel, a millionaire financier, in order to find the money to help meet her dying father's medical bills. By 1994, she has become Martel's mistress. At this time, Harry is still living under his real name, Mateo Blanco, a well-respected film director. Martel is excessively possessive of Lena, but she is determined to become an actress and manages to win the main role in Blanco's film Chicas y maletas (Girls and Suitcases) by bringing Martel in as financier/producer. Martel spies on Lena and Mateo by sending his inhibited, effeminate gay son, Ernesto Jr., to videotape the production of the film, ostensibly for a \"making of\" feature, then hiring a lip-reader to interpret the conversations. Martel, seething with jealousy, screens the videos as the lip-reader narrates the furtive whispers of Lena and Mateo's passionate affair. Furious, Martel confronts Lena, and when she threatens to leave him, he pushes her down the stairs. But when she survives the fall, he relents and nurses her back to health. Lena makes a bargain with Martel agreeing to stay with him provided he allows Mateo to finish shooting the film and decide the final edit. Reluctantly Mateo accepts this arrangement and finishes the shooting, but as soon as this is completed he escapes with Lena to Lanzarote using the name 'Harry Caine' to avoid detection. Lena takes a job as a hotel receptionist to pass the time. When she and Blanco read in El País that Chicas y maletas has received terrible reviews from critics, likely the end of Blanco's directing career, they decide to start over again together far from Madrid. Fate intervenes when Blanco is seriously injured and Lena is killed in a car accident, which is immortalized by Ernesto Jr., who has been trailing them with his camcorder. Mateo loses his sight permanently. Judit, his long-time production assistant, and an 8-year-old Diego arrive to help Blanco pick up the pieces and return to Madrid, where he eventually writes screenplays in braille under the pseudonym Harry Caine, represented by his agent, Judit. The story picks up where it began in 2008: Harry shares his birthday in a bar with Judit and Diego. Judit becomes drunk on gin and, stricken with guilt, confesses to Harry that she sold out to Martel in 1994 because of her fury at Harry for abandoning the film to run away with Lena; she also tells him of her involvement in providing Martel the phone number of the hotel in Lanzarote where Lena and Mateo were hiding. She confirms that Martel sabotaged the release of Chicas y maletas by using the worst take from each scene in order to destroy Mateo's reputation. The next morning, she reveals to Diego that Harry is actually his father, a fact both men were unaware of. Having exorcised some of his demons, Harry decides to return to his life as Mateo Blanco. Though believed lost, the original reels of Chicas y maletas and Ernesto Jr.'s camcorder footage are recovered: Judit had ignored Martel's order to destroy them and instead had hidden them away. Mateo and Diego re-edit the film for its long-delayed release as the director envisioned it.",

    "Synopsis": "American siblings Oscar (Nathaniel Brown) and Linda (Paz de la Huerta) live in an apartment in Tokyo, and have vowed to stay together following the accidental death of their parents. Oscar deals drugs while Linda works as a stripper in a Tokyo strip club. Most of the film takes place in Oscar's first-person perspective, with flashbacks to his and Linda's past taking place from an outside perspective. One evening, after Linda has left for work, Oscar smokes DMT and indulges in a hallucinogenic trip until his friend Victor (Olly Alexander) summons him to a drug deal at a bar known as \"The Void\". Oscar's other friend Alex (Cyril Roy) spontaneously visits and accompanies him to the bar. On the way, Alex discusses The Tibetan Book of the Dead, a Buddhist scripture on reincarnation, and anticipates the events to come by describing the process of death. Oscar enters \"The Void\" alone, and finds that he has walked into a sting; the police raid the bar when Oscar greets a distressed Victor. Oscar escapes into a bathroom stall and vainly attempts to flush the drugs into the squat toilet. As the officers try to kick in the door, Oscar bluffs that he is armed, resulting in the police shooting him in the chest through the door. Oscar's soul – as well as the first-person perspective – rises from his body, and he goes in search of Linda, attempting to fulfill his promise to never leave her. For the remainder of the movie, Oscar's soul travels through Tokyo, watching over his friends and sister, as well as flashing back to memories of his childhood and his earlier life in Tokyo that led him to become a drug dealer. The lives of Oscar and Linda are presented in short non-chronological flashbacks; in the midst of a happy childhood, their parents were killed in a violent car crash. Before being sent to different foster homes, the siblings took an oath to always be there for each other. Years later, Oscar lived as a small-time drug dealer in Tokyo and was soon able to afford a plane ticket for Linda to live with him. Linda found work as a stripper for nightclub owner Mario. As Oscar's business expanded, Victor discovered that Oscar had sex with his mother to secure extra funding for Linda's plane ticket. This led him to set up the raid that ended Oscar's life. Linda becomes pregnant, loses her job as a stripper, and has an abortion. Alex is forced into hiding on the streets after Oscar's dealer, Bruno, breaks up the drug ring. Linda wishes she had gotten involved with Alex instead of Mario as Oscar wanted. On one occasion, Linda wishes that Oscar would come back to life; Oscar then enters Linda's head and experiences her dream in which he wakes up at the morgue, from which his body is taken to be cremated. Greatly distressed by the presence of her deceased brother's cremated remains in her home, and constantly plagued by nightmares about the loss of him, she dumps the ashes down the drain of her kitchen sink. Meanwhile, Victor argues with his mother over her involvement with Oscar, and he is thrown out of the house. He then visits Linda to apologize for his role in Oscar's death. However, when he also accuses Linda of complicity in her brother's death, she angrily chases Victor away, demanding that he kill himself. Oscar hovers over Tokyo and lands on a plane, in which Oscar's mother breast-feeds a baby Oscar. Linda and Alex take a taxi to a Tokyo love hotel and have sex. Oscar moves among hotel rooms and observes several other couples having sex in various positions. He also spots Victor giving fellatio to a man in one of the rooms, with another man watching and taking his belt off. Each couple emanates flashes of light from their genitals. Oscar enters Alex's head and witnesses the sex with Linda from Alex's perspective. He then travels inside Linda's vagina to witness Alex's penis thrusting into it, then observes his ejaculation and follows the channel of sperm into the fertilization of his sister's ovum. The final scene is shot from the perspective of a baby being born, with the camera focus strongly blurred, making it unclear who the woman in the scene is.",

    "Synopsis": "Mia Williams, a volatile and socially isolated 15-year-old, lives on an East London council estate with her single mother, Joanne, and younger sister, Tyler. Mia has just fallen out with her best friend, Keely. She doesn't get along with her precocious sister, nor with her verbally abusive mother. Mia provokes Keely's other friends with physical aggression. Mia regularly practices hip-hop dance alone in a deserted flat in her family's building, drinking alcoholic cider beforehand. Later, Mia comes across a tethered horse in a Traveller encampment. She tries to free it, only to be caught and chased by two young men, the horse's owners. Billy, the younger of the two, is less hostile to Mia. Mia's mother Joanne's new boyfriend, Connor, is charming and handsome. He notices Mia's dance moves, and invites Mia and Tyler to come with him and Joanne on a day-trip to the countryside. He introduces them to his favourite song, Bobby Womack's version of \"California Dreamin' , and shows Mia how to catch a fish using her bare hands. Although Mia is abrupt with Connor, she seeks his attention. A social worker visits Joanne regarding Mia, offering a referral to a boarding unit for disengaged teens. Mia flees. At an internet café, Mia takes a poster stuck up in the window by a club that is clearly advertising for erotic dancers. Friends of Keely enter the internet cafe and argue with and attack Mia. Later, Mia visits Connor at work where he is a security guard. Connor encourages her to apply for the dancing audition, lending her a video camera to record an audition on. Their interactions become increasingly flirtatious. Connor later administers a flirtatious spanking to Mia when she returns, and Mia becomes jealous and angry when she overhears Connor and her mother having sex. After that, Mia assists Billy in stealing a car engine part from a junkyard, appearing to flirt. Mia is invited by the club to perform in person after sending in her tape. With Joanne passed out drunk upstairs, and after Mia and Connor have also been drinking, Connor asks to see Mia's dance routine. She dances to \"California Dreamin' , and Connor initiates sex. Connor tells Mia to keep their liaison a secret. The following morning, Mia hears her mother crying as Connor has left. In her anger, Joanne tells Mia she planned to abort her whilst pregnant. Mia tracks Connor down to his middle-class home. He explains that he cannot see her anymore because of her age and drives her to a station. However, Mia returns to his house and sneaks in. She finds a video camera which reveals footage of Connor's partner and their young daughter, Keira. Mia angrily urinates on Connor's living room floor, and then sneaks out of the back door when the family return home. Mia lingers by Connor's home and eventually leads Keira away from her family. Keira tries to escape Mia, who catches up with her and tells her to stop running. Keira starts angrily kicking Mia's legs, and when she doesn't stop, Mia pushes her into the River Thames. After realizing what she has done, she helps Keira get out and takes her home anonymously. Connor soon chases Mia down post Keira's return, chasing Mia across a field and forcefully slapping her. Mia goes to her dance audition, soon realising its true nature. The other participants perform erotic auditions. Mia takes the stage, but as the music she had chosen (\"California Dreamin'\" from Connor's CD) starts, she dejectedly leaves the stage. Mia heads to Billy's home, not finding the horse. Billy tells her that the horse had to be put down, to which Mia responds by breaking down in tears. Billy invites Mia to relocate with him to Cardiff. Mia returns home to pack for the trip, and, despite their coldness, joins Joanne and her sister in synchronised dancing to Nas' \"Life's a Bitch\". Mia and Billy depart for Wales after Mia is embraced by Tyler.",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, film plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. Please go to the talk page before making any major changes. --> In 1941, Austrian SS-Standartenführer Hans Landa interrogates French dairy farmer Perrier LaPadite about a fugitive Jewish family, the Dreyfuses. He boasts his nickname, \"The Jew Hunter,\" then offers LaPadite amnesty if he will give up the Dreyfuses. LaPadite tearfully admits that they are hiding under his floor. Landa's men massacre the Dreyfuses, but one of them, young Shosanna, escapes unharmed. Three years later, U.S. Army lieutenant Aldo Raine recruits Jewish-American soldiers to the \"Basterds,\" a black ops commando unit tasked with instilling fear among Nazis in occupied France by killing and scalping them. The group includes Sergeant Donny \"The Bear Jew\" Donowitz, privates first class Smithson Utivich and Omar Ulmer, rogue German sergeant Hugo Stiglitz, and Austrian-born translator Corporal Wilhelm Wicki. Raine leaves a swastika mark on surviving German soldiers so they can't hide their Nazi affiliations after the war. Shosanna now operates a cinema in Paris under the name Emmanuelle Mimieux and meets Fredrick Zoller, a famed German sniper set to star in the German propaganda film Stolz der Nation (Nation's Pride). Infatuated with \"Emmanuelle,\" Zoller convinces Joseph Goebbels to hold the film's premiere at her cinema. Landa, the premiere's head of security, interrogates Shosanna but doesn't reveal if he recognizes her. She plots with her Afro-French lover and projectionist, Marcel, to kill the German leaders by burning down the cinema with her collection of highly flammable nitrate films. British Commando Lieutenant Archie Hicox, a former film critic and fluent German speaker, is recruited for Operation Kino, an attack on the premiere with the Basterds. Disguised as German officers, Hicox, Stiglitz, and Wicki meet with German film star Bridget von Hammersmark, an undercover Allied agent, in an occupied town at a tavern unexpectedly full of German soldiers. They sit down and play board games together. Hicox's unusual accent catches the attention of Wehrmacht sergeant Wilhelm and SS Sturmbannführer Dieter Hellström, who joins Hicox's group when his suspicions are aroused. Hicox and Hammersmark convince him they are genuine, but Hicox blows their cover with a non-German hand gesture. Everyone is killed in the ensuing gunfight except Wilhelm and a wounded von Hammersmark. Raine negotiates with Wilhelm for von Hammersmark's release until she shoots Wilhelm dead. Believing she set his men up, Raine tortures von Hammersmark, but she convinces him of her loyalty and reveals Adolf Hitler himself is attending the premiere. Raine decides the mission needs to go ahead with himself, Donowitz, and Ulmer to attend posing as Italian filmmakers. Von Hammersmark is doubtful but thinks the Germans won't find their Italian accents suspicious. Landa investigates the tavern and finds von Hammersmark's shoe and a napkin with her signature. The Basterds infiltrate the premiere with timed explosives. Landa, fluent in Italian, sees through their cover and confronts von Hammersmark privately, strangling her to death. He has Raine arrested along with Utivich, whom he has also detected, but leaves Ulmer and Donowitz in the theater. Taking advantage of the situation, Landa offers to let the attack proceed if Raine's OSS commanders will guarantee his safety along with great riches for himself after the war. Raine contacts his commanders, and Landa negotiates a generous deal for himself and his radio operator. During the screening, Zoller confronts Shosanna in the projection booth, and they shoot each other dead. As Nation's Pride reaches its climax, Shosanna's face appears on the screen telling the Nazi audience that they are about to be killed by a Jew. Having locked the auditorium, Marcel ignites a pile of nitrate film behind the screen, setting the theater ablaze. Ulmer and Donowitz break into the opera box, fatally shoot Hitler and Goebbels then begin randomly firing into the crowd of fleeing Nazis. The timed explosives, previously hidden by Landa on the balcony, detonate, killing Ulmer, Donowitz, and the entirety of the Nazi Party. Landa and his radio operator drive Raine and Utivich into Allied territory, where they surrender to Raine. Raine shoots the radio operator and triumphantly carves a swastika into Landa's forehead, declaring it to be his masterpiece.",

    "Synopsis": "Newly-wedded Criminology student Peping works as a part-time drug money collector for a shady syndicate. During a routine collection of drug money one night at Luneta Park, his friend Abyong informs him that their boss Kap (or Vic) requires his presence for another secret \"operation\". Peping reluctantly agrees and they enter a van parked nearby, where four other men (Kap, Sarge, Chico, and driver Rommel) were waiting. The van stops by a night club and Sarge convinces prostitute Madonna (or Gina) to speak to Kap in the van. Inside the van, Madonna is abruptly beaten and restrained with duct tape. As the van is about to enter the NLEX tollway, an unidentified boss (Gen) calls Kap and orders them to put down Madonna. Sarge and Chico beat her unconscious and the group believes she is dead. At the expressway, a police car is in pursuit but eventually overtakes and arrests another driver. The men stop at a remote house and carry Madonna's body to the basement. Sarge throws a bucket of water to find Madonna still alive. Peping learns from Abyong that Madonna had a debt of more than worth of drugs. Kap orders him, Abyong and Rommel to buy food and liquor, as Gen is still in a meeting. Inside the van, Abyong calms down Peping and gives him a licensed gun—a gift from Kap and the \"cure for nervousness\". As they stop by a local store, Rommel tells Peping to buy balut from the nearby bus station. Peping buys and attempts to escape by bus but is forced to return to the van. Back at the house, the other men enter the basement after Kap receives a call from Gen implying that it is time. Madonna begs for forgiveness from Kap but Kap leaves her, insisting that \"business is business\". Madonna is beaten by Sarge and raped by Chico; she is then killed by Chico with a bolo knife, and her remains are dismembered and placed in sacks. The men carry the sacks to the van and clean the room of evidence. Inside the van, the men indiscriminately toss out the body parts along the way. They stop by a local eatery and order lechon kawali. Peping loses his appetite after throwing up in the eatery bathroom. He asks Kap if he can leave, at which Kap hands him some money for his baby's milk and says he will eventually get used to it. A news reporter is later seen interviewing residents about a severed head found in a garbage dump. Peping rides a taxi home as his wife Cecille prepares some breakfast while carrying their baby.",

    "Synopsis": "Eric Bishop is a football fanatic postman whose life is descending into crisis. Looking after his granddaughter is bringing him into contact with his ex-wife, Lily, whom he abandoned after the birth of their daughter. At the same time, his stepson Ryan is hiding a gun under the floorboards of his bedroom for a violent drugs baron. At his lowest moments, Bishop considers suicide. But after a short meditation session with fellow postmen in his living room, and smoking cannabis stolen from his stepson, hallucinations bring forth his footballing hero, the famously philosophical Eric Cantona, who gives him advice. His relationship with Lily improves dramatically. Bishop finds the gun and confronts his stepson. Ryan admits to his involvement with the drugs gang, and Bishop attempts to return the gun to the gangster. He is forced to keep it himself, however, when a Rottweiler is set on him in his car. The gangster then posts footage on YouTube of Bishop's humiliation. The entire family is then arrested by the police on a tip-off but they fail to find the gun as it is hidden in the fridge, inside a frozen chicken. Eric Cantona then advises Bishop to seek help from his friends and to 'surprise' himself. Bishop organises 'Operation Cantona', sneaking dozens of fellow Manchester United fans – wearing Cantona masks (including Cantona himself) – into the gangster's house and humiliating him and his family, threatening to put the video of their operation onto YouTube, in turn. The film ends at Bishop's daughter's graduation day, where the family reunites in peace.",

    "film_title": "Taking Woodstock",
    "Synopsis": "Set in 1969, the film is based on the true story of Elliot Tiber, an aspiring Greenwich Village interior designer whose parents, Jake and Sonia, own the small dilapidated El Monaco Resort in White Lake, in the town of Bethel, New York. A hippie theater troupe, The Earthlight Players, rents the barn, but can barely pay any rent. Due to financial trouble, the motel may close. Elliot pleads with the local bank not to foreclose on the mortgage and Sonia delivers a tirade about her struggles as a Russian refugee. The family is given until the end of the summer to pay up. Elliot plans to hold a small musical festival and has obtained a $1 permit from the town's chamber of commerce (of which he is also the president). Upon hearing the Woodstock Festival organizers face opposition against the originally planned location, he offers his permit and the motel accommodations to organizer Michael Lang. A neighbor, Max Yasgur, provides his nearby farmland; they agree on a $5,000 fee, but after realizing how many people will attend, Yasgur demands $75,000, which the organizers reluctantly accept. Elliot comes to agreement about the fee for the motel more smoothly. Initial objections by his mother quickly disappear when she sees the cash paid in advance. Elliot and Yasgur encounter some expected opposition. The local diner refuses to continue serving Elliot, inspectors target the motel (and only his) for building code violations, and some local boys paint a swastika and hate words on the motel. However, resistance quickly dissolves in the tidal wave of peace and love (and commerce) brought to the area. The Tiber family works hard serving the massive influx of visitors and become wealthy in the process. A cross-dressing veteran, Vilma, is hired as a security guard. Elliot also struggles with hiding his homosexuality from his family, when he connects romantically with one of the event organizers staying at the motel. On the concert's first day, Elliot, his father, and Vilma hear the music begin in the distance. Elliot's father, transformed and enlivened by all the new life in town, tells Elliot to go watch the concert. Elliot hitches a ride through the peaceful traffic jam on the back of a benevolent state trooper's motorcycle and arrives at the event. He meets a hippie couple, who invite him to join them on an LSD trip in their VW Bus a short distance from the crowd. Elliot initially has trouble relaxing but gradually melts into a psychedelic union with them. When they finally emerge after sundown, Elliot watches the vast crowd and brilliant lights of the distant concert ripple with harmonious hallucinatory visuals that swell into serene white light. Elliot returns home from his liberating experience and has breakfast with his parents. He suggests to his mother that they now have enough money to replace him, but she cannot bear to release him. Elliot storms out, facetiously suggesting his mom eat the hash brownies Vilma has just offered. After another beautiful day at the festival, during which his Vietnam veteran friend, Billy, appears to overcome his post-traumatic stress disorder, Elliot returns home to find his parents laughing and cavorting hysterically, having eaten Vilma's hash brownies. The once-brittle family (particularly Sonia) is united in joy and delirious affection. The next morning, however, Sonia inadvertently reveals that she has secretly saved $97,000 in cash in the closet's floorboards. Elliot is upset that his mother hid this while he used his own savings to help his parents. After the final day of the concert, Elliot decides to move to California. He packs up his things and says farewell to his father, who encouraged him to strike out on his own. As Elliot pays one last visit to the concert and looks out over the muddy desolation of the Yasgur farm, Lang rides up on horseback and they marvel at how despite the obstacles, the event was a success. Lang mentions his next big project: staging a truly free concert in San Francisco with the Rolling Stones.",

    "Synopsis": "An unnamed elderly tailor narrates the parable, recounting events from a distant year in which he worked as a village schoolteacher and met his fiancée Eva, a nanny. The setting is the fictitious Protestant village of Eichwald, Northern Germany, from July 1913 to 9 August 1914,<!--\"sunday mess after Beginning of war\"--> where the local pastor, doctor and baron rule over the area's women, children and peasant farmers. The puritanical pastor leads confirmation classes and gives his pubescent children a guilty conscience over apparently small transgressions. He has them wear white ribbons as a reminder of the innocence and purity from which they have strayed. When under interrogation, his son confesses to 'impure' touching;<!-- For those editors who would like to explicitly state that the son was accused of masturbation, please note that the film doesn't. The discussion on the subject led to a consensus that the plot summary remain consistent with the action of the film. --> the pastor has the boy's hands tied to his bed frame each night. The doctor, a widower, treats the village children kindly but humiliates his housekeeper (the local midwife, with whom he is having sexual relations) and also sexually abuses his teenage daughter. The baron, who is the lord of the manor, underwrites harvest festivities for the villagers, many of them his farm workers. Eventually, the schoolteacher's friendship with Eva, the baron's nanny, leads to a visit to her family home during a Christmas break; asking for her hand in marriage, he receives from her taciturn father a reluctant permission to marry, but only after a one-year test-period delay. Unexplained harmful events occur over the course of the story. A wire is stretched between two trees, causing the doctor to fall from his horse. An overworked farmer's wife dies at the sawmill when rotten floorboards give way, after which his son symbolically destroys the baron's cabbage field. Her grieving husband later hangs himself. The baron's young son Sigi goes missing on the day of the harvest festival and is found the following morning in the sawmill, bound and badly caned; the baron summarily dismisses Eva as a result. A barn at the manor burns down. After an Italian sojourn, the baroness tells her husband that she is in love with another man, and intends to leave Eichwald. Shortly after the pastor berates his daughter in front of the confirmation class, she opens his parakeet's cage with scissors in hand; the pastor finds the bird on his desk, cruelly impaled in the shape of a cross. The daughter of the steward at the baron's estate claims a violent dream-premonition about harm coming to the midwife's handicapped son, then the boy is attacked and almost blinded, found during a night search along with a well-written note quoting Exodus 20:5. The steward violently thrashes his son for stealing a flute from Sigi. The midwife urgently commandeers a bicycle from the schoolteacher to go to the police in town, claiming that her son told her who attacked him. She and her son are not seen again. Meanwhile, the doctor and his family have also suddenly disappeared, leaving a note on the door indicating his practice is closed. The schoolteacher's growing suspicions lead to a confrontation in the pastor's rectory, where he suggests that the pastor's children and students had prior knowledge of the local troubles and insinuates that they likely perpetrated them. Offended, the pastor berates him and threatens to report him to the authorities and send him to jail if he repeats his accusations. Rumors that the doctor and midwife were at fault for the disturbing events begin to swirl.

    "Synopsis": "Catholic priest Sang-hyun volunteers at a hospital, providing ministry to the patients. He eventually volunteers to participate in an experiment to find a vaccine for the deadly Emmanuel Virus (EV). The experiment fails, and Sang-hyun is infected with EV, but makes a complete and rapid recovery after receiving a blood transfusion. News of his recovery spreads among the parishioners of Sang-hyun's congregation, and they begin to believe that he has a gift for healing. Soon, thousands flock to Sang-hyun's services. Among the new churchgoers are Kang-woo, Sang-hyun's childhood friend, and his family. Kang-woo eventually invites Sang-hyun to join the weekly mahjong night at his house. There, Sang-hyun finds himself attracted to Kang-woo's wife, Tae-ju. Sang-hyun later relapses into his illness and wakes in need of shelter from the sunlight, having become a vampire. Sang-hyun soon finds himself drinking blood from a comatose patient. Aghast, Sang-hyun attempts to commit suicide, but finds himself irresistibly drawn to human blood. EV's symptoms return and only seem to go away when he drinks blood. Trying to avoid committing a murder, Sang-hyun resorts to stealing blood transfusion packs from the hospital. Tae-ju, who lives with her ill husband and overprotective mother-in-law Mrs. Ra, eventually begins an affair with Sang-hyun. However, when she discovers the truth about Sang-hyun, she retreats in fear. When Sang-hyun pleads with her to run away with him, she turns him down, suggesting that they kill Kang-woo instead. When Sang-hyun's superior at the monastery requests vampire blood so that his eyes may heal and he may see the world before dying, a disgusted Sang-hyun flees from the monastery. He moves into Mrs. Ra's house so that he may secretly have sex with Tae-ju. Sang-hyun notices bruises on Tae-ju and assumes that Kang-woo is the cause, a suspicion that she confirms. Sang-hyun decides to kill Kang-woo during a fishing trip with the couple. He pulls Kang-woo into the water and claims to his superior that he placed the body inside a cabinet in a house at the bottom of the lake, putting a rock on the body to keep it from floating to the surface. When Sang-hyun's symptoms return, he kills his superior and drinks his blood. A police investigation ensues. Mrs. Ra drinks often after Kang-woo's death, sinking into a completely paralyzed state. Sang-hyun and Tae-ju are haunted by visions of Kang-woo's corpse. When Tae-ju lets slip that Kang-woo never abused her, Sang-hyun is enraged because he only killed Kang-woo to protect her. Distraught, she asks Sang-hyun to kill her and let her return to Kang-woo. Sang-hyun kills her, but after feeding on her blood, decides that he does not want to be alone forever and feeds her corpse his own blood. She awakens as a vampire. Mrs. Ra, knocked to the floor by a seizure, witnesses everything. Tae-ju soon starts killing indiscriminately to feed, while Sang-hyun acts more conservatively, only killing when necessary. Their conflicting ethics result in a chase across the rooftops and a battle. Mrs. Ra eventually manages to communicate to Kang-woo's friends that Sang-hyun and Tae-ju killed her son. Tae-ju kills two of the friends, and Sang-hyun appears to eliminate a third one. Realizing the gravity of the situation, Sang-hyun tells Tae-ju that they must flee or be caught. Sang-hyun then places Mrs. Ra in his car and drives into the night with Tae-ju. Before leaving town, he makes a visit to the camp of people who worship him. He makes it seem like he tried to rape a girl, leading the campers to chase him away, no longer idolizing him. At the house, the third friend escapes; whom Sang-hyun only pretended to kill to protect her from Tae-ju. Meanwhile, Sang-hyun drives to a desolate field with no cover from the imminent dawn. Realizing his plan to have them both burn when dawn breaks, Tae-ju tries to hide but Sang-hyun foils her every attempt. Resigning herself to her fate, she joins him on the car hood, and both are burnt to ash by the sun, as Mrs. Ra watches from the backseat of the car.",

    "Synopsis": "In Macau, three men break into a house, shoot Irene Costello (Sylvie Testud) and kill her husband and two children. Irene's father, Francis Costello (Johnny Hallyday), arrives to visit his daughter who is now suffering from serious injuries. She is nevertheless able to tell her father that there were three shooters and that she shot one of the killers in the ear. At a hotel, Costello meets Kwai (Anthony Wong), Chu (Lam Ka-Tung) and Fat Lok (Lam Suet), a trio of hitmen who are hired to murder the unfaithful wife of Triad crime boss George Fung (Simon Yam). After overhearing the murder in a hotel room, Costello reaches an unspoken agreement to walk away. Costello later tracks down Kwai's syndicate, hands them a stack of euros and his watch, and asks them to help him avenge his daughter's family's deaths. Before doing so though, he takes a Polaroid picture of each of the hitmen, and writes their names on the pictures so that he will not forget who they are. The four go to the apartment where the shooting occurred and work out what happened, the number of shooters and the weapons used. The four visit a landfill to meet Kwai's cousin Tony, who supplies illegal arms. Tony tells them that he \"sawed off\" a matching weapon for a Hong Kong hitman who works on Seafood Street. As the four men reach the street, they see a man with a bandage over his ear. However, they see only two men. Kwai's syndicate decide to wait until the men lead them to the third attacker. The two suspects head towards the countryside as Kwai's syndicate follows. The two men later reach a nature reserve as the third killer shows up. The trio meet their wives, their kids and Kwai's syndicate during a barbecue. After a tense standoff, they explain that they killed Costello's grandchildren because the children had seen their faces. Not wanting to start a shootout in front of the three attackers' wives and children, everyone waits until they have left. A moonlit gun battle ensues, with both sides suffering injuries. The three attackers flee, while Costello and Kwai's syndicate take refuge at a run-down apartment in Hong Kong to treat their wounds. Costello reveals that he is a former assassin and has had a bullet in his head for twenty years, which is affecting his memory. Shortly after they have tended to their wounds, Kwai receives a phone call from triad boss Fung, who informs him that three of his men need help, and are with an underground non-registered doctor known as \"Old Five\". Fung tells Kwai that his men were attacked by three Chinese men and one white man. The four men realize that Fung ordered the hit on Costello's daughter and her family. They head to the dwelling and kill the three attackers but leave Old Five alive, who telephones Fung reporting what had happened. Fung then contacts Kwai, explaining that Thompson Cheung Chi-shun, Costello's son-in-law, was handing over Fung's financial reports to the police, and that he only ordered his men to kill the parents. Kwai replies that his syndicate has switched their loyalty from Fung to Costello as a matter of honor. Later that night, Fung sends more killers to Kwai's refuge in order to eliminate Kwai's syndicate. A gunfight ensues, with the four men emerging victorious. As they escape, Kwai's syndicate lose track of Costello, who is walking through a crowded street, seemingly lost in the night rain. He pulls out the Polaroid pictures that he took of the hitmen earlier, and tries to find them in the crowd. They meet again, but it becomes evident that Costello has a problem with his memory, and has rapidly forgotten who his friends are, but also what he is doing. The hitmen try to explain to Costello that he is seeking revenge for his daughter, but Costello does not recognize her, nor does he understand the concept of revenge. The three men give up in despair, and take him to a beach where they meet Kwai's friend, Big Mama (Michelle Ye), a pregnant woman with a group of children. Kwai gives her a stack of money and ask her to take care of Costello. Kwai's syndicate return to Macau because they lost contact with Kwai's cousin Tony who supplies their ammunition. When they reach the landfill where Tony is living, they find him and his partner dying as they were tortured by Fung and his gang. Soon, a large group of assassins sent by Fung show up and a gunfight ensues. Kwai, Chu and Fat Lok are killed. Costello and Big Mama learn of the shootout during a news report. Later that night Costello has a vision of the 3 Hitman and Irene in the afterlife, implying his daughter died of her injures and also reminding him of his mission for revenge against Fung. The next day, Fung is having tea in a public square surrounded by his subordinates. He sees a beautiful woman (actually is Big Mama) having tea in the same square. As he tries to get her attention, a large group of children come asking him to buy charity stickers. The children place stickers on Fung and his men. Big Mama leaves the square and meets up with Costello, then tells him that the man back in the square with the most number of stickers is Fung. Costello thanks her, makes his way to the square and begins to shoot a great many of the guards as well as Fung as chaos ensues. However, Fung turns out to be wearing a bulletproof vest. His subordinates help him run away from Costello, who gives chase on foot. As Costello walks, he checks the bystanders for stickers, which tips Fung off to the fact that Costello does not actually recognize him, apart from the stickers he is wearing. Fung removes the stickers from his coat, and puts them on the jacket of a subordinate instead. This causes Costello to shoot Fung's subordinate. Fung then removes his coat with all the stickers and runs off. Costello picks up the trenchcoat and shoots more subordinates who get in his way. Fung is finally the last surviving member, so he attempts to walk nonchalantly by Costello, relying on the Frenchman's inability to recognize him without the coat, but as he is walking by, Costello sees a sticker on Fung's tie. Both men shoot at each other. Fung is hit and Costello demands that he put the coat on, which Fung refuses, so Costello shoots him in the leg. Fung puts the coat on, Costello checks the bullet holes in the coat and sees that they align with the bullets stuck in the bullet-proof vest he was wearing. Costello then stands up and fires a round into Fung's head, killing him. Costello is last seen eating and laughing with Big Mama and her children.",

    "Synopsis": "The film opens in 1907, with Ida Dalser watching a speech by the young journalist and socialist Benito Mussolini. She immediately falls in love with him and they begin a torrid affair. Mussolini initially opposes Italian involvement in the European Great War, but then reverses his position. This leads to his expulsion from the Italian Socialist Party, and he develops a new political philosophy, which will become Italian fascism. He decides to start a newspaper to expound his views, and Dalser sells all her belongings to finance it. They have a son, Benito, then Mussolini goes to war, and Dalser does not hear from him for a long time. When she does, he is in hospital recovering from wounds, but when she goes to visit him, she finds that he has a new wife and a daughter. Dalser insists that he is legally married to her, but he denies it. From then on, Mussolini appears in the film only in newsreels, reflecting the fact that Dalser never sees him in person again. By the early 1920s, he is Italy's leader, and in the process of concluding a concordat with the Vatican. Dalser intensifies her campaign to prove that she is Mussolini's wife and that her son, Benito Albino, is legitimate. She finds that all the might of the fascist state is turned against her. She is committed to an asylum, and when she continues to protest from there by writing to the newspapers, and even to the Pope, Benito Albino is committed to a different asylum. Dalser descends gradually into madness. Although the film ends with a caption listing the official cause for their deaths (Dalser in 1937 and Benito Albino in 1942), the film's last scenes hint at the possibility that one or both of them were murdered.",

    "Synopsis": "Tom Hepple, a geologist, and Gerri Hepple, a counsellor, are an older married couple who have a comfortable, loving relationship. The film observes them over the course of the four seasons of a year, surrounded by family and friends who mostly suffer some degree of unhappiness. Gerri's friend and colleague Mary works as a receptionist at the health centre. She is a middle-aged divorcee seeking a new relationship, and despite telling everyone she is happy, appears desperate and depressed, and seems to drink too much. The Hepples' only child, Joe, is 30 and single and works as a solicitor giving advice on housing. In the summer, the Hepples are visited by Ken, Tom's old friend from his student days. Ken is overweight, eats, smokes and drinks compulsively and seems very unhappy. Tom and Gerri host a barbecue in his honour. Mary drives her newly bought car to the party, but gets lost and arrives late. Having had some wine, she flirts with Joe, whom she has known since he was little. He remains friendly but does not reciprocate. After the party, Mary reluctantly gives Ken a lift to the train station. He makes a clumsy romantic advance and Mary irritably rejects him. Months later, in the autumn, Mary is once again at Tom and Gerri's home. Joe arrives with Katie, a new girlfriend. Mary appears rude and hostile towards Katie, which Tom and Gerri don't appreciate, creating a rift between Gerri and Mary. In the winter, Tom, Gerri, and Joe attend the funeral for the wife of Tom's brother Ronnie. Towards the end of the service, Ronnie's estranged son Carl arrives, and angrily asks why the ceremony was not delayed for him. At the reception at Ronnie's house, Carl becomes aggressive and walks out. Tom and Gerri invite Ronnie back to London to stay with them for a while and Ronnie agrees. While Tom and Gerri are at their garden allotment, Mary arrives unannounced at their home and persuades Ronnie to let her in. Her car has just been wrecked and she is upset. They have a cup of tea and a desultory chat before Mary takes a nap on the settee. When Tom and Gerri return, they are unhappy to find Mary there. Gerri explains to Mary that she feels let down by her earlier behaviour towards Katie. Mary apologises and weeps. Gerri gradually extends a degree of warmth to Mary, suggesting she should seek counseling and inviting her to stay for dinner, and the two women set the table. Joe and Katie arrive, their relationship still appearing strong and happy. The Hepples enjoy dinner together. Mary eats with them but appears lost and uncertain.",

    "Synopsis": "Uxbal lives in a shabby apartment in Barcelona with his two young children, Ana and Mateo. He is separated from their mother Marambra, an alcoholic prostitute with bipolar disorder. Having grown up an orphan, Uxbal has no family other than his brother Tito, who works in the construction business (and sometimes solicits Marambra's services). Uxbal earns a living by procuring work for a group of Chinese illegal immigrants who make forged designer goods which a group of African street vendors then sell. He also works as a medium to the dead, passing on messages from the recently deceased at wakes and funerals. When he is diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer, leaving him with only a few months to live, his world progressively falls apart. Uxbal initially begins chemotherapy, but he later ends the treatment at the advice of his friend Bea, an alternative healer. She gives him two black stones which she asks him to give his children before he dies. The group of Africans are arrested by the police, despite Uxbal's regular payment of bribes, because they also deal in drugs. When one of them is deported back to Senegal, Uxbal offers his wife Ige and baby son a room in his apartment. Meanwhile, an attempt at reconciliation with Marambra fails when Uxbal realizes she cannot be trusted to look after their children. As the Chinese are out of work, Tito brokers a deal to get them employed at a construction site. However, almost all of them die in the night from carbon monoxide poisoning, as the cheap gas heaters Uxbal bought in an effort to help were not safe. An attempt by a human trafficker to dump the bodies into the sea fails when they are washed up on the shore shortly after, causing a media sensation. As Uxbal's health continues to deteriorate, he is plagued with guilt that he is responsible for the expulsion of the Senegalese and the death of the Chinese. With his death drawing nearer, he realizes that there will be nobody to take care of Ana and Mateo once he is gone. He entrusts the remainder of his savings to Ige, asking her to stay with the children after his death. She accepts his request but later decides to use the money to return to Africa. At the apartment, Uxbal sees Ige's silhouette behind the bathroom door and hears her voice saying she has returned. Uxbal lies down next to Ana and, after having passed on to her a diamond ring which his father had once given to his mother, he dies. In a snowy winter landscape he is reunited with his father, who had died before Uxbal's birth and shortly after having fled Francoist Spain for Mexico.",

Five years have passed since the lives and destinies of Komdiv (General) Sergei Petrovich Kotov, his wife Maroussia, their daughter Nadia, as well as those of Mitya and the Sverbitski family, were irrevocably changed: it has meant five years of incarceration for General Kotov, the former Revolutionary hero betrayed by Stalin. He escapes certain death in the Gulag and fights on the Eastern Front as a private. It has been five years of terror for his wife Maroussia, without the husband she believes is dead and with a daughter who has rejected her. Nadia has spent five years in hiding, proud of her father whom she refuses to disown and whom she believes is alive, despite all reports to the contrary. Mitya survived his suicide attempt, and reluctantly continues to execute the orders of a regime he holds in contempt. Stalin, with his nation under attack by former ally Adolf Hitler, recalls many of those whom he has had exiled to the GULAG. He tries to mobilize the Soviet population – by any means necessary – to rise against the threat of Nazism. Kotov is now fighting at the front. Nadia, who has survived an attempted rape by German soldiers, is now a nurse risking her own life to save others.",

    "Synopsis": "British writer James Miller makes a stop in Arezzo, Tuscany, on a tour to promote his new book, Certified Copy, which argues that, in art, issues of authenticity are irrelevant because every reproduction is itself an original, and even the original is a copy of another form. A French antiques dealer, who is never named, attends the event with her 11-year-old son in order to have Miller sign several copies of the book she has purchased, but has to leave early because her son is hungry and becomes a distraction. She leaves her phone number with Miller's book's translator. Later, her son suggests that she is romantically interested in Miller, which she denies. Miller and the woman later meet at her shop. Though she had intended for them to browse antiques together, he instead suggests that they go for a drive, as long as they are back for his 9 p.m. train. On their aimless trip, Miller signs six copies of his book for the woman, including a copy for her sister, Marie, in which he inscribes a note that the woman dislikes. The two debate the premise of his book, including the relationship between authenticity and simplicity. During the conversation, which occasionally becomes strained, Miller points out that even the Mona Lisa is a \"copy\" of the woman who modeled for the painting, real or imagined. The woman takes Miller to an art museum to see another famous \"copy\", but he is uninterested, saying that he has already finished work on the book and is not interested in further examples. The woman becomes increasingly distraught as she complains about her rebellious son to Miller, but he attempts to rationalize her son's behavior, frustrating the woman. At his insistence, they visit a nearby café for coffee. When Miller steps out to take a phone call, the café owner begins speaking to the woman, mistaking Miller for her husband. The antiques dealer plays along as the café owner espouses the importance of marriage, regardless of the flaws of one's partner. Miller returns and the woman tells him about the café owner's assumption of their relationship. Once they leave the café, the nature of their discussion changes, and they begin to speak in a combination of French and English instead of just English (Miller states that he only learned French, not Italian, in school). They also begin to behave as though they are a married couple, referring to the woman's son as \"our\" son. She expresses unhappiness over their 15th wedding anniversary the previous night, during which he fell asleep while she was getting ready in the bathroom, and tells him his constant traveling for work has made him emotionally distant. Walking through the city, they encounter an older couple and discuss their interpretations of a nearby statue. The older man pulls Miller aside and offers unsolicited \"fatherly\" advice: that a small gesture of affection could mend the rift between Miller and his wife. As Miller and his wife walk away, he places his hand on her shoulder; when they go into a restaurant, she goes to the bathroom and applies lipstick and puts on earrings. When she returns to the table, Miller is angry, having clashed with the waiter over the quality of the wine. They begin to fight and Miller leaves the restaurant, though he waits for her outside. They soon find themselves at the hotel where Miller and his wife spent their honeymoon, though Miller does not remember the specifics of the hotel. The woman goes inside and asks to tour the room; she and Miller reminisce about their wedding night, although Miller does not remember many details. The woman appeals to Miller, saying that they should be more accepting of each other's faults, because the alternative is loneliness. He appears to rebuff her, saying he still has to catch his 9 p.m. train. Miller then goes into the bathroom and looks into the mirror; when nearby church bells begin to toll at 8 p.m., he leaves the bathroom.",

    "Synopsis": "Valerie Plame is employed by the Central Intelligence Agency, a fact known outside the agency to no one except her husband and parents. She is an intelligence officer involved in a number of sensitive and sometimes dangerous covert operations overseas. Her husband, Joseph C. Wilson, is a diplomat who most recently has served as the U.S. ambassador to Gabon. Due to his earlier diplomatic background in Niger, Wilson is approached by Plame's CIA colleagues to travel there and glean information as to whether yellowcake uranium is being procured by Iraq for use in the construction of nuclear weapons. Wilson determines to his own satisfaction that it is not. After military action is taken by George W. Bush, who justifies it in a 2003 State of the Union address by alluding to the uranium's use in building weapons of mass destruction, Wilson submits an op-ed piece to The New York Times, claiming these reports to be categorically untrue. Plame's status as a CIA operative is subsequently revealed in the media, the leak possibly coming from White House officials, including the vice president's chief of staff and national security adviser, Scooter Libby, in part to discredit her husband's allegation that the Bush administration had manipulated intelligence to justify the invasion of Iraq. As a result, Plame is instantly dismissed from the agency, leaving several of her delicate operations in limbo and creating a rift in her marriage. Plame leaves her husband, further angered by his granting of television and print interviews, which expose them both to public condemnation and death threats. Wilson ultimately persuades her, however, that there is no other way to fight a power as great as that of the White House for citizens like them. Plame returns to him and testifies before a Congressional committee, while Libby is convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice and given a 30-month prison sentence, although President Bush commutes the jail time on Libby's behalf.",

    "Synopsis": "Claudio (Elio Germano) is a young construction worker who lives a happy life with his pregnant wife Elena (Isabella Ragonese) and their two children in Rome. They manage together their daily difficulties with love and complicity. One day at the construction site, Claudio discovers the corpse of an illegal Romanian worker who died while working intoxicated, but decides not to report the discovery for fear that the site will be closed down. His life is further struck when Elena dies while giving birth to their third son Vasco, right after their vacation. This is the beginning of a new phase for Claudio, who now concentrates on becoming richer, and buying \"things\" for his three sons in the hopes of making them happier after losing their mom. Claudio blackmails his employer, Porcari, about the dead Romanian worker, demanding his own construction site to supervise in exchange for his silence. Claudio obtains the whole construction business, not only the wall building business. Claudio obtains 50,000 Euros from his drug-dealing neighbour Ari to start the work. One day, the Romanian's former lover Gabriela (Alina Madalina Berzunteanu) and his son Andrei (Marius Ignat) come looking for the missing man, but Claudio does not tell them about the truth. He befriends Gabriela and has sex with her. He offers Andrei a job, and allows him to stay at his apartment with his family. More and more difficulties, however, put Claudio in dire straits. Claudio soon runs out of money and time. The construction work is behind schedule. Claudio also cannot pay the illegal workers, and they eventually quit and steal equipment from Claudio. Later Claudio tells Andrei the truth about his father and Andrei leaves, in anger. Claudio asks Porcari to give him more time for the construction job, but is rejected. Claudio eventually turns to his brother, Piero (Raoul Bova) and sister, Loredana (Stefania Montorsi) to borrow more money for the work. He hires more expensive workers and manages to finish the construction work. He is also able to repay his debts. He encourages Piero to show Gabriela his love. Andrei, however, is still angry with Claudio. The film ends with Claudio allowing all of his children to sleep on his bed he once shared with Elena. Previously, he had forbidden his children to play in, which shows he has changed his vision of life and now gives importance to what has real value.",

    "Synopsis": "It is summer, and young driver Georgy takes his light truck on a trip to another town with a cargo of flour. He is stopped at a road police post by a pair of rude and corrupt policemen. While they are flirting with a woman they stopped earlier, Georgy manages to grab his papers and leave unnoticed. There, he picks up a hitchhiker, an old man who recounts to him a disturbing story: soon after World War II, while returning home from the front, a corrupt military officer brazenly robbed him by threatening him with arrest if he did not comply. He later shot the officer in retaliation. Later, when Georgy parks his truck and steps out and shortly returns, the old man has disappeared. Later, Georgy meets an underage prostitute. He takes pity on the girl and gives her some money and food, but she is offended by his charity, insults him and leaves. Later still, Georgy is lost in the night and decides to camp in the field until dawn. Three locals approach and try to steal from the truck, only to be stopped by Georgy. They distract him with some neutral conversation, telling him how one of their friends is a mute because someone killed his father in front of him when he was a child. Suddenly one man hits Georgy on the head with a log and he loses consciousness. The scene shifts to the time period of World War II. Early in the war, two Soviet soldiers from a defeated unit cautiously feel their way through the occupied land in the deep German rear. They enter a lone house where a widowed teacher lives with his young son. The teacher is kind to the soldiers and provides them with much-needed food and shelter. However, the soldiers regard his pacifism and indifference towards the German invaders as treasonous, so they kill him, rob the house, and continue on their way, leaving the child to his own devices. The scene shifts back to the present. Some time has passed. It is winter, and Georgy lives in the same house that once was the teacher's. The blow has left him feeble-minded and mute. He walks around bearded, dilapidated, with a blank stare. The woman living in the house keeps him as a sex slave while she trades his flour on the local market. A policeman approaches and tells her that Georgy and his truck are being searched for, so she had better get rid of both. Georgy is beaten by the locals and detained by the police, only to be released the next night when another inmate challenges the lone guard to a fight, beats him unconscious, and unlocks the cells. The woman sells Georgy's truck and leaves, abandoning him in the snowcapped village. Homeless, he wanders about being driven off by the locals, until he collapses from exhaustion. He is found and picked up by the old man whom he earlier gave a ride to. A military van comes to the village, carrying two servicemen tasked with delivering the body of a deceased soldier to his native place. Their daunting task is not made easier by the fact that one of them, an officer, suffers from delirium tremens. Unable to locate the relatives of the dead soldier, they decide to bribe some random people into signing the papers and leave the body to them. They approach the old man, who at first is suspicious but eventually agrees. However, shortly afterwards Georgy walks out of the house to find the old man dead. It is hinted that he may have been axed by the officer, who in his alcoholic delusion mistook him for someone else. Georgy numbly grabs the old man's pistol and walks out to the road, where he is picked up by a very talkative truck driver, who rambles about the importance of not meddling in other people's affairs. Meanwhile, on the road the same two police officers from the beginning of the movie stop a police major and his wife. When they begin to write him up for a burnt-out headlight, the major attempts to bribe and intimidate them. When this fails and he turns to leave, a fistfight ensues, with the major handcuffed and brutally beaten. To produce two fake witnesses of his arrest, they stop another car, which is the truck with Georgy. They easily threaten the driver into signing the papers, but when they turn to Georgy, he stands silently. A fight breaks out, and one of the policemen pulls out an assault rifle. Georgy instantly shoots him dead, then everyone else. Still clutching the pistol, he staggers out into the dark.",

    "Synopsis": "The film opens with a quotation from the Book of Psalms: \"I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High. But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.\" (Psalm 82:6–7) The monks' peaceful routine of prayer, medical assistance, and community interaction is soon interrupted by the threat of an Islamic fundamentalist group. When their elected leader, Christian, declines the protection of the corrupt civil authority, the monks divide amongst themselves on the question of whether to stay or flee Algeria. Before a decision is reached, a group of fundamentalists, led by Ali Fayattia, enters the monks' compound in force on Christmas Eve and demands their doctor and his medical supplies. Christian refuses their requests and cites the Quran as proof of the monks' goodwill. With a mixture of surprise and respect, Fayattia leaves the compound and grants it his protection until his capture, torture and death at the hands of government forces. Despite the growing danger, the monks come to consensus on the moral importance of maintaining their committed lives with, and ministry to, the local population, even when faced with violence and death. Ultimately, the terrorists seize most of the monks during a nighttime raid and hold them hostage. As the captive monks trudge a snowy path towards a grim fate, the film concludes with the spiritual testament of Prior Christian de Chergé, bravely written in the face of death.",

    "Synopsis": "The film begins with a sumptuous banquet at the opulent estate of the Grand Yakuza leader Sekiuchi (Soichiro Kitamura), boss of the Sanno-kai, a huge organized crime syndicate controlling the entire Kanto region. He has invited the many Yakuza leaders under his control. After the formal conclusion of the banquet, Kato, the chief lieutenant of Sekiuchi, pulls one of the Yakuza leaders, Ikemoto, aside and makes plain that he is displeased with the news that Ikemoto has become friendly with a rival gang leader, Murase, while the two were unexpectedly imprisoned together. Kato, underboss of the Sanno-kai, orders Ikemoto to bring the unassociated Murase-gumi gang in line, and Ikemoto immediately passes the task on to his subordinate Otomo (Beat Takeshi), who runs his own crew. Shortly thereafter an incident occurs at a nightclub owned by Murase where a man posing as a customer is inadvertently put through a shakedown for about one million yen. It turns out that this is a member of the Otomo family who has been planted into the nightclub in order to help set-off the conditions for an all-out gang war against the Murase family. Murase, who is completely in the dark concerning his having fallen out of favor with Sekiuchi, tries to ameliorate the situation by relying on his former prison friendship with Ikemoto, not knowing that Ikemoto is under orders to terminate his gang. He accepts Ikemoto's advice several times not suspecting any ill-intentions from Ikemoto and each time he further weakens his strength, his resources and his crime family. In one incident, Otomo leaves vicious scars on the face of Kimura who is Murase's chief lieutenant. When the dust finally settles from the escalated tensions, Ikemoto and Murase are killed, Otomo is in a maximum security prison, unexpectedly with Kimura, and is stabbed twice in a prison ambush by Kimura in the belly with a makeshift knife. The complex interactions in the film finally come full circle and the film ends with Kato secretly killing Sekiuchi and taking control as the new Grand Yakuza leader of the Sanno-kai organized crime syndicate.",

    "Synopsis": "The movie opens on a river scene with children playing on the bank. The body of a girl in a school uniform floats by. Yang Mi-ja (Yoon Jeong-hee), a 66-year-old grandmother, consults a doctor at a hospital who is concerned about her forgetfulness, and refers her to a specialist. As she leaves the hospital she sees a woman crazy with grief because her 16-year-old daughter has drowned. Though Mi-ja lives on government welfare, she has a small job taking care of a well-to-do elderly man who has had a stroke. At home, she cares for her ill-mannered 16-year-old grandson, Jong-wook (Lee David), whose divorced mother lives in Busan. When Mi-ja asks Jong-wook about the girl from his class who drowned, Jong-wook says he didn't know her. When Mi-ja notices a poster advertising a poetry class at a local community center, she decides to enroll. The course assignment is to write one poem by the end of the month-long course. At the suggestion of her teacher, she begins writing notes about the things she sees, especially flowers. Jong-wook frequently leaves home at odd hours to socialize with five other boys from school. One night, he invites all of them over without notifying Mi-ja, who nevertheless tries to be a gracious host, offering them a snack before they disappear into Jong-wook's bedroom. Later, one of the boys' fathers insists that Mi-ja join him and the other boys' fathers for a meeting. She is told that the group of boys have repeatedly raped a girl, Agnes, over the past six months, before she jumped off a bridge into a river and drowned. Her diary was discovered, though only four members of the school's faculty were aware of the situation. The fathers fear retribution for their boys, and the school fears a scandal that will tarnish its reputation. To avert a full police investigation, the parents of the boys offer to pay a settlement of 30 million won to the widowed mother, a poor farmer. Mi-ja, who cannot afford her 5 million won portion of the payment, is pressured to ask her daughter (Jong-wook's mother) for the money. Though Mi-ja occasionally speaks to her daughter on the phone, she does not mention the situation. When Mi-ja is diagnosed with early stage Alzheimer's disease, she again neglects to tell anyone. She attempts to confront Jong-wook about his actions, but he simply ignores her. Mi-ja begins attending a local weekly poetry reading. A brash man frequently reads beautiful poetry at these readings, but follows them with crude sexual jokes that offend Mi-ja. Another amateur poet explains to Mi-ja that the man is a policeman with a good heart, and was recently reassigned from Seoul after exposing corruption within its police force. Mi-ja temporarily quits her job caring for the elderly stroke victim after he makes a desperate sexual advance toward her. She later returns after a journey to the bridge where Agnes jumps, and her hat flies off into the water. She walks down to the riverbank and sits, writing poetry until it begins raining. Dripping wet, she returns to the elderly man, agreeing to have sex with him. When she does, she appears emotionless. Mi-ja is walking home and, on the way, is greeted by a reporter. He asks her questions about how the money offer is going, and if the mother is not willing to accept. Mi-ja casually confirms that, but soon realizes that she may be telling him too much. As she attempts to leave, the reporter becomes aggressive and tries to make her stay to answer more questions. She hurries away, making a phone call. In another meeting with the fathers, Mi-ja mentions what she told the reporter. The fathers are disappointed, but decide that it is not that consequential. Mi-ja is told to travel to the countryside to convince Agnes' mother to accept the settlement. One of the fathers drives her to the countryside. Initially not finding Agnes' mother at home, Mi-ja eventually comes across her working in the field. Mi-ja begins raving about how beautiful the weather, flowers, trees, and fruit are, forgetting about the task at hand. The two have a pleasant exchange before Mi-ja turns and begins to walk away. Finally, she remembers that she was meant to confront the woman about the settlement, but is too embarrassed and continues to leave. Mi-ja attends another poetry reading evening. Afterwards, she sits crouched outside, crying. The policeman who was at the reading comes out for a smoke, and asks Mi-ja why she is crying. She doesn't answer right away, so he stays crouched beside her. The scene ends there. When she returns home, she takes out from her purse the picture of Agnes that she took from the memorial service, and places it on the table for her grandson to see the next morning. A few days later, Mi-ja returns to the father to admit that she still cannot pay her portion of the settlement. Though annoyed that she still hasn't contributed her share, the fathers are overjoyed that Agnes' mother has agreed to settle, despite Mi-ja's failure to previously ask her to. Mi-ja asks the elderly man for the money she needs, refusing to tell him what it is for. Wondering if this is Mi-ja's attempt at blackmail, he pays her. Once the settlement has been paid to Agnes' mother, Mi-ja phones her daughter to come home, and insists that Jong-wook shower and cut his nails. That night, the crude policeman from the weekly poetry readings appears with his partner to take Jong-wook away. Mi-ja does not protest. The film concludes with Mi-ja's poetry teacher discovering a bouquet on the class podium with her poem, \"Agnes's Song\", but Mi-ja herself is not present. Her daughter returns to an empty home, and calls Mi-ja's phone, but receives no answer. The teacher begins to read Mi-ja's poem to the class. Mi-ja speaks in voiceover, though the voice of Agnes herself takes over midway through, following Agnes from the science lab, where she was raped, to the bus, to the bridge where she is to jump. Agnes turns to the camera, half-smiling, leaving Mi-ja's fate on an ambiguous note.",

    "Synopsis": "The film opens with a bustling city street, where a young woman commits suicide by jumping from a building ledge. Eun-yi, who works in a restaurant, persuades her coworker and roommate to drive her to the scene of the suicide, and she stands distraught over the chalk outline where the woman's body had lain. The next morning, an older woman named Byeong-sik visits her small apartment and later expresses interest in giving her a job. Eun-yi is hired as an au pair for Hae-ra, who is pregnant with twins, and her rich husband Hoon. Eun-yi's primary task is watching the couple's young daughter, Nami. Eun-yi is eager to connect with Nami, who gradually warms to her. Hoon begins to secretly flirt with Eun-yi, enticing her with glasses of wine and his piano playing, and they eventually begin a sexual relationship. Despite the affair, Eun-yi is still warm and friendly to Hoon's oblivious wife, Hae-ra; she even expresses enthusiasm and delight at the progress of Hae-ra's pregnancy. Byeong-sik, aka \"Miss Cho\" (the other live-in maid, originally Hae-ra's childhood maid), witnesses Eun-yi and Hoon having sex. She tries to subtly pry details from Eun-yi, but Eun-yi brushes her off casually. Later, Miss Cho reveals her suspicion that Eun-yi is pregnant to Hae-ra's mother, Mi-hee. Mi-hee then visits the family and stages an \"accident,\" resulting in Eun-yi falling from a ladder positioned at the top of a set of stairs. Dangling from a chandelier, Eun-yi begs Mi-hee to pull her over the railing. She does not oblige, and Eun-yi falls. Suffering only a concussion, Eun-yi spends the night in the hospital. During her stay, she learns that she is pregnant and contemplates abortion. Meanwhile, the affair is revealed to Hae-ra. Mi-hee instructs Hae-ra to ignore the affair; she insists that all wealthy husbands will eventually cheat and that if Hae-ra ignores it she can \"live like a queen.\" Later that night, Hae-ra stands over Eun-yi's bed with a golf club but is unable to strike the sleeping woman. The next day, Hae-ra and her mother confront Eun-yi, offering her $100,000 to have an abortion and leave. Hae-ra knows that Eun-yi would not abort her child \"for all the money in the world,\" so she takes matters into her own hands by poisoning the herbal medicine packets Eun-yi drinks every day. Hae-ra goes to the hospital and delivers her twin sons. Hoon visits the hospital, where Hae-ra makes her ill-will toward him known. Furious, he returns home alone and finds Eun-yi in his bathtub. She reveals that she is pregnant with his child and plans on keeping the baby. Eun-yi falls unconscious due to the effects of the poison, and Mi-hee arranges an abortion without Eun-yi's consent. After the abortion, Miss Cho reveals to Eun-yi that she was the one who told Mi-hee about Eun-yi's pregnancy. Eun-yi is angry, but forgives Miss Cho and vows to get revenge on the family. After recovering from the unwanted abortion, Eun-yi sneaks into the house with Miss Cho's assistance. Hoon finds her breastfeeding one of the newborn babies. Hae-ra insists that Miss Cho chase Eun-yi out of the house, but Miss Cho refuses and quits her job on the spot. Eun-yi then confronts the entire family (Hae-ra, Mi-hee, Hoon, and Nami), hanging herself from the same chandelier she once clung to, then lighting her body on fire as the family watches in horror. The final scene depicts the family outdoors in the snow celebrating Nami's birthday, all speaking English. While Hae-ra sings \"Happy Birthday\", Hoon hands a glass of champagne to Nami. Both appear insane as Nami looks on.",

    "film_title": "The Princess of Montpensier",
    "Synopsis": "Sickened at the meaningless bloodshed between Catholics and Protestants in the French Wars of Religion (1562-1598), the Count of Chabannes, a Huguenot Protestant, of middle age, decides to desert from the Prince of Condé's army. Captured by bandits who are about to hang him, he is rescued by a former pupil, the young Prince of Montpensier, who has been fighting for the Catholic side, but who bears a high regard for his former tutor. The two ride together to the castle of the Mézières family, whom the prince's father has been visiting to negotiate a marriage between his son and their daughter. This is Marie Mézières age 17. She has never met her intended husband, but has been on intimate terms with her childhood friend, the hot-headed young Henri Duke of Guise of the powerful and ambitious Guise family. Guise is outraged to hear that Marie is to be given to another. He and Montpensier draw swords, but Chabannes stops the fight and tries to reconcile them. The grateful Montpensier takes Chabannes, whose life is in danger since he is now considered an enemy by the Catholics and a deserter by the Huguenots, into his protection. thumb|Henri, duc de Guise After their marriage the newly-weds, accompanied by Chabannes, travel to Montpensier's castle. On the way Chabannes confesses to Marie his revulsion at the brutality of the religious wars and his remorse over his former part in them, for in the heat of battle, he had killed a pregnant woman. Not long after their arrival a summons from the royal court in Paris abruptly separates the young couple, who are still barely acquainted. The prince leaves Marie to the care of Chabannes as her tutor, directing him to polish up her humanistic education so that she can be presented at court. In the course of their studies the lonely bride and the disillusioned count become close, so much so that the older man, struck by Marie's quickness of mind as well as her beauty, imprudently confesses his hopeless love. She answers that she will forget his words, for she values his friendship. Montpensier returns home for a while but soon receives a letter summoning him again to Paris. When Chabannes takes the letter to the bedroom, he finds couple asleep naked, and Marie does not attempt to cover herself. Before Montpensier can take his departure, however, Guise appears on their estate with his cousin, the elegant and polished Duke of Anjou, brother of the childless and ailing King Charles IX, and next in line to the throne. By chance, the visiting noblemen see Marie standing in a boat on the river, accompanied by her women. Anjou, too, is struck by Marie's beauty. Reluctantly, Montpensier, who is now prey to the most intense jealousy, invites them into the castle for dinner, where Anjou, Guise, Montpensier, and Chabannes, all now in love with Marie, engage in tense conversation.thumb|Henri, duc d'Anjou The party then travels to Paris, where Montpensier surprises Guise and Marie talking intimately together. Swords are again drawn. This time it is Anjou who breaks up the fight. Guise then catches Marie on a staircase and starts kissing her, but she breaks away. She confides in Chabannes, who advises her to keep well clear of Guise. Guise, he warns her, is simultaneously courting another woman, the royal princess Marguerite of Valois, sister of Anjou. But Marie, driven by passion, still desires a meeting with Guise. At a masked ball she asks Guise to meet her on the same staircase as before. However, the man behind the mask is not Guise but Anjou. Anjou immediately finds Guise and tells him to stay away from Marie. He then goes to Marie and also warns her that Guise is an unscrupulous character who is presently courting his sister, Princess Marguerite. Montpensier, maddened with helpless jealousy and humiliation, orders Chabannes to escort Marie back to the country in the morning. That night, however, Guise, shows up, puts a dagger to Chabannes' throat, and demands to be taken to Marie's bedroom. Once admitted, Guise declares his love, but hearing blows on the locked door, he escapes. Montpensier breaks in and, furious to find Chabannes in his wife's bedroom, dismisses him from his service and departs. Guise then slips back in and has a night of love with Marie. Marie rides home alone, while the now penniless Chabannes takes a room in a modest inn in exchange for working in the stables. Marie and her husband decide to separate, though the prince still hopes for a reconciliation. On the evening of 24 August 1572 the dread Massacre of Saint Bartholomew begins: Catholic mobs led by Guise start massacring all the Protestants they can find. While protecting a pregnant woman, Chabannes is killed. Montpensier rides to see Marie to give her the news that Chabannes is dead, that Anjou is going away to be king of Poland, and that Guise is marrying a wealthy heiress at Blois the next day. Marie rides immediately to Blois and tells Guise she is ready to leave Montpensier for him, but he answers that he no longer loves her and must keep his engagement. Marie remembers the last words to her of Chabannes: “As you have lost the trust of your husband and the heart of your lover, at least you have my true friendship.” Dressed in black, through a snow-covered landscape, she rides to his tomb.thumb|Château de Blois",

    "film_title": "Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives",
    "Synopsis": "In a grassy area, a water buffalo breaks free from a rope tethering it to a tree. It wanders into a forest, where it is spotted by a man holding a sickle. The man begins to lead it somewhere, while a silhouette with red glowing eyes watches. Boonmee lives in a house on a farm with his sister-in-law Jen and his nephew Tong. Boonmee is suffering from a failing kidney; his Laotian assistant Jaai administers dialysis treatments to him. One night, while Boonmee, Jen and Tong are eating dinner together, the ghost of Boonmee's wife Huay appears. Huay, who died over a decade ago, says that she heard Jen and Boonmee's prayers for her, and is aware of Boonmee's poor health. A hairy, red-eyed figure joins them, and is revealed to be Boonmee's long-lost son Boonsong. Boonsong, who practiced photography, had disappeared some years after Huay died. Boonsong was searching for a creature—whom he calls a \"Monkey Ghost\"—that he had captured in one of his photos. He says that he mated with a Monkey Ghost, causing his hair to grow longer and his pupils to dilate, and that, after meeting his mate, he forgot \"the old world\". During the day, on the farm with Jen, Boonmee asserts that his illness is a result of karma. He claims that it was caused by his killing of communists while serving in the military, and his killing of bugs on the farm. A princess is carried through a forest in a litter. She walks near a waterfall, and gazes at her reflection in the water, which she perceives to be more youthful and beautiful than her real appearance. She is kissed by one of her servants, but insists that he imagined kissing her reflection. The servant departs, and she sits by the water and weeps. She is complimented by a catfish, prompting her to enter the water. She makes offerings of her jewelry in return for being made to look like her reflection, and then has intercourse with the catfish. Boonmee lies in bed near a sitting Huay, who has just administered his dialysis treatment. He hugs her, and asks about how he might be able to find her in the afterlife. She tells him that the spirits of the deceased are not attached to locations, but to people. Later, Boonmee, Huay, Jen and Tong venture out into the forest. Jen and Tong see shadowy figures running through the bushes and leaping between the trees. Huay leads Boonmee, Jen and Tong into a cave. Boonmee believes that he was born in the cave, in a past life he cannot recall. He recounts a dream of a future civilisation in which authorities shine \"a light\" on \"past people\", causing them to disappear. Huay disconnects Boonmee's dialysis tube. By the next day, Boonmee is dead. Following Boonmee's funeral, Jen sits on a bed, organising gifts of baht with her friend Roong. Tong, now a monk, arrives, saying that he has been having difficulty sleeping at the temple. He showers and changes from his robes to a T-shirt and jeans. While preparing to go out to eat with Jen, he is stunned to see himself, Jen and Roong on the bed, watching television. He and Jen leave for a restaurant, while another him, another Jen and Roong remain on the bed.",

    "film_title": "Drive (2011 film)",
    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, film plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. --> A man in Los Angeles (billed as \"The Driver\") works as a mechanic, stunt double, and criminal-for-hire getaway driver. His jobs are all managed by auto shop owner Shannon, who persuades Jewish-American mobster Bernie Rose and his half-Italian partner Nino \"Izzy\" Paolozzi to purchase a stock car for the Driver to race as a legitimate business for them all. The Driver grows close to his new neighbor, Irene, and her young son, Benicio, but their relationship is interrupted when Irene's husband, Standard Gabriel, is released from prison. While in prison, Standard owed protection money to an Albanian gangster named Cook, who demands Standard rob a pawn shop for $40,000 to pay off the debt, threatening to harm Benicio and Irene. Driver offers to act as the getaway driver for Standard and Blanche, Cook's accomplice. At the pawn shop, Blanche exits with a bag of money, but Standard is killed by the store owner. Another car waiting in the parking lot immediately pursues them, but Driver shakes it off. Hiding at a motel, a suspicious Driver forces Blanche to admit she and Cook planned to take the money for themselves, and Cook's henchmen were in the waiting car. As well as this, she reveals the bag holds $1 million. Informed by her text messages, two gunmen locate the motel room and one kills Blanche. Driver, in return, kills both gunmen. Shannon offers to hide the money, but Driver declines. Interrogating Cook at a strip club, he learns that Nino was behind the robbery. The Driver calls Nino and offers to return the money in exchange for peace. However, Nino instead sends a hitman to the Driver and Irene's apartment building. The Driver tells an angry Irene about his involvement with her husband's death, and they enter the elevator, not realizing the hitman is in it. Noticing the man's gun, the Driver kisses Irene goodbye. He subdues and brutally stomps the hitman to death in front of a horrified Irene. The Driver confronts Shannon, who reveals that he called Bernie about the money and unwittingly mentioned Irene. Furious, the Driver tells Shannon to flee, as Nino will surely hunt them both. Nino reveals to Bernie that a low-level Philadelphia mobster stashed the money at the pawn shop to set up a new operation. Anyone tied to the robbery must be killed, as they could lead the East Coast mob to Nino and Bernie. Learning this, Bernie reluctantly murders Cook. When Shannon refuses to divulge the Driver's whereabouts, Bernie fatally slashes Shannon's forearm with a straight razor. The Driver discovers Shannon's corpse at the auto shop. He disguises himself with a rubber stuntman's mask and follows Nino from the pizzeria to the Pacific Coast Highway. He rams Nino's car onto a beach, killing his driver, before drowning him in the ocean. He calls Irene and tells her that he will not return, explaining that she and Benicio were the best part of his life. The Driver meets with Bernie, who promises that Irene will be safe in exchange for the money. At the Driver's car, Bernie stabs him in the stomach, but he stabs Bernie to death and manages to drive away, leaving Bernie's corpse and the money behind. Irene knocks on the Driver's apartment door and walks away when no one answers. Although wounded, the Driver drives into the night, his fate ultimately unknown.",

    "Synopsis": "Eliezer Shkolnik (Shlomo Bar Aba) is a philologist who researches the textual tradition of the Jerusalem Talmud. He and his son Uriel (Lior Ashkenazi) are both professors at the Talmudic Research department of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Uriel, a charismatic academic, is extremely popular with the department's students and the general public, and is also recognized by the establishment when he is elected a member of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities. The father, on the other hand, is a stubborn old-school purist in his research methods. He is unpopular, unrecognized, and frustrated by his would-be lifetime research achievement having gone unfulfilled, as a rival scholar, Prof. Yehuda Grossman (Micah Lewensohn), published similar results one month ahead of Eliezer. Eliezer is also highly critical of the new methods of research used by his son and other modern researchers, as he considers them superficial. His ambition is to be recognized by being awarded the Israel Prize, but he is disappointed every year when he does not win it. His nature and the lack of recognition have made him bitter, anti-social, and envious of his son's popularity. Eliezer receives a phone call from the office of the Minister of Education, and is told that he has been elected this year's laureate of the Israel Prize. The following day, Uriel is summoned to an urgent meeting with the Israel Prize committee. Uriel is told that an error had occurred and that in fact it was he, not his father, who was awarded the Israel Prize. The committee wishes to discuss ways to correct the error, but Uriel objects, saying the revelation would devastate his father. Uriel and the head of the committee, Grossman, argue over the issue until Uriel loses his temper and shoves Grossman. Regretting his outburst, Uriel relents and asks that the committee permit him to break the news to his father personally. During the meeting, Uriel says he has been submitting his father's name for the Israel Prize every year, and accuses Grossman of blocking that and other ways of recognizing Eliezer. According to Grossman, Eliezer never published anything significant in his career, and his only claim to fame is being mentioned as a footnote in the work of a more famous scholar. Uriel goes to the National Library to break the news to his father but finds him raising a toast to winning the prize with colleagues. Unable to break the news, he once again meets with Grossman, asking that the prize be given to Eliezer. Grossman relents but with two conditions: Uriel must write the committee's recommendation, and Uriel can never be a candidate for the prize. Uriel is evidently shocked by the second condition, but ultimately agrees. Uriel writes the recommendation text, picking and choosing every word carefully; at the same time, Eliezer, finally recognized, is interviewed by the newspaper Haaretz, during which he impugns the scientific and academic validity of Uriel's research. When the interview is published, Uriel is angry but keeps his secret. Later, though, he whispers the secret to his mother. She does not disclose the truth to anyone else. During preparations for a television interview, Eliezer is struck by an uncommon Talmudic expression in the Israel Prize committee's recommendation. He flees the television studio and returns to his study. He examines the expression, cross-checking its published uses, and realizes that the text must have actually been written by Uriel. Eliezer also reconstructs his phone conversation with the Minister of Education, realizing she had addressed him by his last name only. He concludes that the minister thought she was talking to his son when she broke the news about the Israel Prize. On the day of the prize ceremony, Eliezer and his wife arrive at the Jerusalem International Convention Center to prepare for the ceremony; Eliezer is stressed and distracted. The movie ends a moment before the laureates are called to the stage.",

    "Synopsis": "The opening sequence showcases extreme slow-motion shots of the main characters, a collapsing horse, falling birds, butterflies, different planets, and images of Earth colliding with a rogue planet. Justine weds Michael in a castle owned by her brother-in-law John and her sister Claire. Justine and Michael are late for the reception due to their stretch limousine's difficulty traversing the narrow and winding rural road. Upon their arrival, Justine sees a star in the sky shining brightly. John, an astronomy enthusiast, explains it is the star Antares. When Michael and Justine arrive, they are asked by the wedding planner to guess how many beans are in a bottle for a game. Michael answers but Justine does not. The festivities are less than harmonious; Justine's divorced parents Gaby and Dexter verbally abuse each other in front of the guests. Justine, to John and Claire's annoyance, keeps wandering away. Justine's employer Jack, who announces her promotion to art director of his advertising firm, expects her to write a slogan for a new campaign during the celebration. Justine finds herself pushed into a role that others have chosen for her and falls back into depression, from which she has been suffering for a long time. Toward the end of the party, which goes on until the early hours of the morning, she quits her job in an argument and calls off her marriage to Michael after having sex with another man. After everyone leaves, Claire is told by the wedding planner that the number of beans in the bottle was 678 and that nobody guessed correctly. Early the following morning, while horse riding with Claire, Justine notices that Antares is no longer visible in the sky. Some time later, Justine arrives at John and Claire's estate, having sunk even further into depression, where she struggles to leave her bed and is unable to eat. Antares's apparent absence is revealed to be due to a rogue planet, \"Melancholia\", which appeared from behind the Sun and passed in front of Antares, occulting it. John says that according to the scientists' calculations, Melancholia will pass in proximity to Earth, but will not collide with it. Claire looks anxiously at Melancholia's path on the internet, learning of a theory that having bypassed Earth, it will turn back and collide with it. John tries to calm her down but secretly secures food and gasoline. In view of the approaching planet, Claire increasingly loses her composure, while Justine longs for the end of the world. Justine tells Claire that \"all life on earth is evil\", and deserves to die. Justine also confidently claims that there is no other life in the universe. When Claire asks how she knows this, Justine simply responds, \"I know things\" and reveals that she somehow knew there were 678 beans in the bottle at the party when nobody else did. Claire follows Justine into the woods at night as she \"sunbathes\" naked in the planet's glow. Strange omens occur in the days that follow. The electricity in the castle goes out, the butler does not come to work, the horses in the stable are restless, St. Elmo's fire is seen at various times, and the weather changes erratically. Melancholia initially flies past Earth, seemingly vindicating John and the scientists. However, a gravitational interaction between the planets sends Melancholia across Earth's orbit for a second time, now moving on a path towards it. On discovering this, John takes his life by overdosing on pills. Claire finally knows for sure that Melancholia will collide with Earth and hides John's death from the family. She attempts to flee with her son Leo, but the cars will not start. Justine declines to spend her final moments with Claire on the terrace by candlelight and wine, finding this suggestion absurd. Instead, Justine calms Leo down by suggesting that they build a \"magic cave\" out of branches. Shortly before the collision, Justine, Claire, and Leo sit under the \"cave\" and hold hands. While Justine and Leo seem apathetic to, or at peace with, their impending doom, Claire panics and lets go, succumbing to her despair. Melancholia finally collides with Earth, engulfing them in a sea of flames as both planets shatter against each other.",

He sexually abuses the boy, but they otherwise have something of a father–son relationship. In the evenings, after Michael locks the door and closes the blinds, Wolfgang is allowed into the living room for dinner and to watch TV. When in hospital after an accident, Michael is in a hurry to be released and return to Wolfgang. When Wolfgang gets sick Michael digs a grave in the woods, in case Wolfgang dies. However, he recovers. The boy writes a letter to his parents, to be mailed by Michael, but Michael does not send it and lies to Wolfgang, saying his parents do not want him back. Sometimes, he takes the boy on a pleasure trip outside the town, where people do not know Michael. On one occasion, he goes on a skiing trip with friends for multiple days, leaving extra food for Wolfgang, who has water, a toilet, simple cooking facilities and a TV in his room. Seeing that Wolfgang is lonely, Michael promises to bring another child for company. Together they assemble a bunk bed in advance. Michael attempts to abduct another boy by luring him away, but the boy is called back by his father, who scolds him for walking off with a stranger. Michael tells Wolfgang that he did not succeed in providing him a friend. One day, Wolfgang throws boiling water into Michael's face, nearly blinding him, but does not succeed in escaping. Due to the burns inflicted upon him in the attack, Michael takes his car and attempts to seek medical attention but dies in an accident. After the funeral, Michael's mother is about to discover the boy when the film ends.",

    "Synopsis": "A group of men drive around at night in the rural area of Keskin looking for the buried body of murder victim Yasar Toprak. The perpetrator Kenan recalls burying him near a water fountain with his mentally challenged brother, but the fact that he was drunk during it, the lack of sunlight, and the repetitive landscapes make it difficult for him to find. As the night goes on, prosecutor Nusret tells doctor Cemal about a case he was involved in where a woman correctly informed her husband of her date of death months in advance shortly after giving birth to their child. He explains that she died of a heart attack, but Cemal points out that she could have brought it on intentionally with medication. Commissioner Naci stops Cemal from giving Kenan a cigarette, claiming he has to earn it. The group stops at a nearby village, where the mayor asks Nusret to get Keskin to help fund a morgue, as his town is mostly populated by the elderly and their children want to see their bodies. The wind causes a power outage and the mayor's daughter brings the group tea, where the beauty of her face by lamplight causes Kenan to shed tears. He explains to Naci that he revealed that Yasar's son Adem was actually his, which caused a fight in which Yasar was killed. Naci gives him a cigarette. As the sun rises, Kenan finds the body and the authorities realize it has been hogtied. They untie it, but then realize it was bound so it could fit in the trunk of Kenan's car. Having forgotten a body bag, they force it into the trunk of their car. As they return to Keskin, Adem and his mother Gülnaz watch Kenan emerge from the car. Adem hits Kenan in the head with a small stone, causing him to weep. In conversation with Nusret, Cemal notes a specific drug that could have easily been used to induce a heart attack, which Nusret admits he is familiar with due to his father-in-law's heart problems. Nusret muses that the woman may have committed suicide because of her husband's infidelity but waited to do so after the baby was born, and the way he describes the situation implies that the woman was his wife. Gülnaz confirms that the body is Yasar, and an autopsy reveals the presence of dirt in his lungs after she leaves, indicating that he was buried alive. Cemal omits this from the report. As the technician cuts open Yasar's body, some blood splashes onto Cemal's face. Cemal watches the Topraks leave with Yasar's belongings.",

    "Synopsis": "Lucy is a university student who pays her tuition and rent by doing several jobs: she works in an office in the daytime and at a restaurant in the evenings, and she is occasionally a research subject at a science laboratory. Her sister's boyfriend continually pesters her about paying her share of the rent. She is caring for Birdmann, who is an alcoholic and is very attracted to her. While she does not return his sexual interest, Lucy enjoys Birdmann's company, and in his presence is the only time she is shown smiling or laughing. An old joke between the two is that Birdmann frequently asks Lucy to marry him; Lucy always says no. Due to lack of money and Birdmann's addiction, Lucy makes a decision to look for another part-time job. In response to a classified ad for yet another short-term job, Lucy meets Clara, who runs a service that combines lingerie modelling and catering, performed by young women at a black tie dinner party for mostly male clients. Clara assures her that the men are not allowed to touch the women sexually. Lucy agrees to try it. Clara inspects Lucy's body and names her Sara for the purpose of anonymity. At the dinner party, Lucy is the only girl dressed in white; the other women wear black lingerie that is much more revealing than Lucy's outfit. After one other session as a serving girl, Lucy is promoted. She receives a call from Clara's assistant for a different request. Lucy is driven to a country mansion and offered a new role wherein she will be voluntarily sedated and sleep naked while male clients lie beside her. They are permitted to caress and cuddle her, but vaginal penetration is not allowed. After Lucy falls asleep, she lies unconscious on the bed, and Clara leads in her client. After Clara reminds the man of the no-penetration rule, he strips and curls up beside Lucy. After a few of these sessions, Lucy has enough money to move into a larger, more expensive apartment, where she lives alone. She receives a call from Birdmann, who has overdosed on painkillers. She goes to his house and finds him dying in his bed. Upon a dying man's last request, sobbing, she takes off her shirt and gets in bed with him, but he dies in her arms. At Birdmann's funeral, Lucy abruptly asks an old boyfriend if he will marry her, in an echo of Birdmann's old playful banter. The ex-boyfriend, however, not understanding the reference, takes her seriously and, shocked, refuses her, citing a number of Lucy's personal problems as his reasons. At her next assignment with Clara, Lucy asks if she can see what happens during the sessions while she is asleep. Clara refuses, saying it will put her clients at risk of blackmail. Lucy decides to surreptitiously film her next encounter. The client is once again the first man, but this time, he also drinks the tea with a much larger dose of the sleeping drug. The following morning, Clara comes in and checks the man's pulse, showing no surprise when he cannot be awakened. Clara tries to wake Lucy, who has overdosed as well, but she is eventually able to revive her using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Lucy screams when she sees the dead man in bed next to her. The film ends with the scene captured by the hidden camera: the dead man and the sleeping girl both lying peacefully together in bed.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1927, silent film star George Valentin is posing for pictures outside the premiere of his latest hit film when a young woman, Peppy Miller, accidentally bumps into him. Valentin reacts with humor and shows off with Peppy for the cameras. The next day, Peppy is on the front page of Variety with the headline \"Who's That Girl?\" She capitalizes by auditioning as a dancer and is spotted by Valentin, who insists that she have a part in Kinograph Studios' next production, despite objections from studio boss Al Zimmer. While performing a scene in which they dance together, Valentin and Peppy show great chemistry. With a little guidance from Valentin, who draws a beauty spot on her cheek, Peppy rises through the industry, earning more prominent starring roles. Two years later, Zimmer announces plans to cease production of silent films at Kinograph Studios, but Valentin is dismissive, insisting that sound is just a fad. In a dream, he begins hearing sounds from his environment (as does the audience) but cannot speak himself. He decides to leave the studio for the chance to produce, finance, and direct his own silent film, Tears of Love. The film opens on the same day as Peppy's new sound film Beauty Spot and the 1929 stock market crash. Valentin's only chance of avoiding bankruptcy is for his film to be a hit. Unfortunately, audiences flock to Peppy's film instead, while only a few people attend Valentin's. With Valentin ruined, his wife, Doris, kicks him out, and he moves into an apartment with his valet/chauffeur, Clifton, and his dog. Peppy quickly becomes the first of several major new Hollywood sound film stars. Later, the bankrupt Valentin is forced to auction his personal effects, and after realizing he has not paid the loyal Clifton in over a year, gives him his car before firing him. Depressed and drunk, Valentin sets fire to a stack of his old films. As the nitrate film blazes out of control, he is overwhelmed by the smoke and passes out inside the burning house, clutching a single film canister. However, Valentin's dog attracts the help of a nearby policeman, and after being rescued, Valentin is hospitalized for injuries suffered in the fire. Peppy visits the hospital and discovers that the film he rescued is the one with them dancing together. She asks for him to be moved to her house to recuperate. Valentin awakens in a bed at her house to find that Clifton is now working for Peppy. His ego hurt, Valentin shows ingratitude for Peppy having taken him in, prompting Clifton to remind him of his changing luck. Peppy insists to Zimmer that Valentin co-star in her next film, threatening to quit Kinograph if he does not agree. After Valentin learns that Peppy bought his possessions at auction, he returns in despair to his burnt-out apartment. Peppy arrives and finds that Valentin is about to attempt suicide. She tells him she only wanted to help him. They embrace, and Valentin tells her it is no use; no one wants to hear him speak. Remembering Valentin's superb dancing ability, Peppy persuades Zimmer to let her make a musical production so Valentin can avoid the humiliation of having to speak. Now the audience hears sound for the second time, as the film starts rolling for a dance scene with Peppy and Valentin and their tap-dancing can be heard. Once the choreography is complete, the two dancers are heard panting. The director of the musical calls, \"Cut!\" to which Zimmer adds: \"Perfect. Beautiful. Could you give me just one more?\" Valentin, in his only audible line, replies \"With pleasure,\" revealing a French accent. The camera then pulls back to the sounds of the film crew as they prepare to shoot another take.",

He makes a violent escape from the home and goes to his father's building, where a neighbor tells him his father's apartment is empty. When found by the caretakers Cyril grabs hold of a passing woman, Samantha, who says she doesn't mind. The caretakers take Cyril to the empty apartment, showing his father has abandoned him. The next day, Samantha brings Cyril his bike. Cyril asks her to host him on weekends, she agrees and with her partner Gilles provide Cyril with a happy home. Still, his father's abandonment haunts him, even after discovering his father sold his bike. He confides in Samantha about wanting his father and, without official permission, she tracks him down and takes Cyril to see him. Cyril's father does not meet as agreed but they find him working at a restaurant, where Cyril asks why he has to stay at the home and his father gives no indication of wanting him back. Cyril's father tells Samantha he is now her problem, he has a new life and cannot raise Cyril now that his grandmother is dead. Samantha demands Cyril's father be honest with him and his father tells him not to see him again, causing Cyril to have a breakdown. Cyril is taken under the wing of Wesker, a local gang leader, whom Samantha and Gilles warn him to stay away from. Cyril ignores their requests and begins staying out late with Wesker, straining the couple's relationship. Gilles loses patience with Cyril and leaves Samantha when she chooses Cyril over him, causing her upset. Cyril fails to understand Samantha's feelings and continues running wild. When Cyril refuses to go out with a friend and his family, Samantha suspects he is planning to meet Wesker in secret. When Samantha prevents Cyril from leaving, he screams he does not want to be with her anymore; she tells him to call the children's home but he won't be leaving the house. Cyril stabs her with a pair of scissors and goes to Wesker, who makes him beat and rob a newsstand owner and his son. Fearing discovery, Wesker forces Cyril to keep the stolen money and threatens to kill him if he tells anyone. Cyril tries giving the money to his father, but he does not want involvement. Dejected, Cyril apologetically returns to Samantha. The robbery is settled by Cyril apologizing, but while the owner accepts, his son does not. Later, the son against his father's wishes confronts and chases after Cyril, who climbs a tree to get away but falls when struck by a thrown rock. Believing Cyril has died, the two discuss what lie to tell and how to dispose of the body when Cyril regains consciousness. He declines an ambulance and the two watch aghast as he rides away on his bike.",

    "Synopsis": "Plastic surgeon Robert Ledgard successfully cultivates an artificial skin resistant to burns and insect bites. Calling it \"Gal\", he claims to be testing it on athymic mice. Presenting at a medical symposium, Ledgard privately discloses that he has conducted illegal transgenic experiments on humans. He is forbidden to continue with his research. On his secluded estate, Ledgard holds captive a young woman named Vera with the help of his servant, Marilia. There he continues his illegal experiments. While Ledgard is out, Marilia's estranged son, Zeca, arrives after having committed a robbery. He asks Marilia to hide him for a few days. Seeing Vera on Ledgard's security camera screens, Zeca mistakes her for Ledgard's deceased wife, Gal, and demands to see her in person. When Marilia refuses, Zeca binds and gags Marilia and then rapes Vera. Ledgard arrives and kills Zeca. While Ledgard disposes of Zeca's corpse, Marilia reveals to Vera that both Zeca and Ledgard are half-brothers and her sons, unknown to them. Ledgard was adopted by Marilia's employers, though raised by Marilia, and later went to medical school and married a woman named Gal. Raised without privilege as Marilia’s son, Zeca eventually left to live in the streets and smuggle drugs. When Zeca returned years later, Gal fell in love with him. Zeca and Gal decided to run off together but were involved in a car crash in which Gal was badly burnt. Assuming Gal to be dead, Zeca left the scene of the accident. Ledgard took Gal home, keeping her in total darkness, without any mirror, to hide her burn scars. One day, while hearing her daughter Norma singing in the garden, Gal saw her own reflection in the window. Traumatized by the sight, Gal jumped to her death in front of Norma. After disposing of Zeca’s corpse, in the present, Ledgard returns and spends the night with an acquiescent Vera. Ledgard dreams of the night of a wedding six years earlier, when he found his daughter Norma unconscious on the ground, having been raped. Mentally unstable after witnessing her mother's suicide, under effects of psychosis medication, a disoriented Norma saw Ledgard bending over her and mistakenly believed he raped her. Developing a fear of all men, Norma spent years in a mental health facility, eventually committing suicide as her mother had. Simultaneously in the present, Vera, too, dreams of the same event. Vicente (whose identity is disclosed later) crashed the wedding and met Norma. In the garden, under the influence of drugs, Norma began to take off her clothes. Vicente kissed her, and they lay down on the ground engaging in sexual activity that confused and overwhelmed Norma. When ambient music changed to the song Norma was singing when she witnessed her mother's suicide, Norma started screaming. Vicente attempted to hush her screams, knocking her unconscious. Vicente fled the scene, unaware that Ledgard saw him leave on his motorbike. Tracking down Vicente, Ledgard kidnapped him and held him captive, brutalizing him over a prolonged period. As punishment for raping his daughter, Ledgard made Vicente a human guinea pig for his experiments. Over a period of six years, Ledgard physically transformed Vicente into a replica of his late wife, using transgenesis and shaping Vicente’s physical appearance—moulding a vagina, breasts, hips, buttocks, and feminine voice—and renaming him Vera. In the present, Ledgard's new relationship with Vera dismays Marilia, who does not trust Vera. Fulgencio, one of Ledgard's colleagues, reads a news story about the missing Vicente and recognizes him in Vera. He accuses Ledgard of falsifying Vicente's consent and of experimenting on him. Vera, who overhears their conversation, tells Fulgencio that she is here by her own free will, denies being Vicente, and says that she always was a woman. After Fulgencio leaves, Vera notices a photograph of himself as Vicente attached to the news story about missing persons. During the night, Ledgard and Vera start having sex, but Vera tells him that it is still painful after Zeca's rape. Ostensibly going downstairs to find lubricant, Vera retrieves Ledgard's gun and kills him. Marilia, alerted by the sound of the shot, barges into the bedroom with her own pistol in hand and finds her son Ledgard dead on the bed. Vera, who is hiding under the bed, shoots and kills Marilia. With her final breath, Marilia says \"I knew it.\" Freed from captivity and the need to play along with Ledgard's whims, Vicente returns to his mother's dress shop for the first time since being kidnapped. Tearfully, he tells his lesbian ex-colleague Cristina (whom Vicente had loved six years prior) of his kidnapping, forced sex change, and the murders. As his mother enters the room, Vicente quietly reveals his identity to them: \"I am Vicente.",

    "Synopsis": "The film follows the members of the O'Brien family in the 1940s-1960s and 2010. Most of the film takes place in the 1950s, but the film jumps between different narratives. The O'Briens appear to be a standard American middle-class suburban family. Mr. O'Brien is a successful engineer for an energy company, but has enough free time to indulge his love of music. Mrs. O'Brien is a housewife with many friends in the neighborhood. They have three healthy boys, Jack, R.L., and Stevie. However, the film reveals deep cracks behind the facade, which leave Jack traumatized for decades. ... When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?\" | source = The film begins with a quote from the Book of Job 38:4-7, while a mysterious light flickers in the darkness.}} In the 1960s, Mr. and Mrs. O'Brien are devastated to learn that their son R.L., aged 19, has died. In 2010, Jack is a successful but world-weary architect in an unnamed city. He leads a seemingly empty existence and has a difficult relationship with his elderly father, who still has not gotten over R.L.'s death. In voiceover, Mrs. O'Brien asks God why R.L. had to die. Then a series of dreamlike images depict the birth of the universe, the creation of Earth and the beginning of life. At one point a dinosaur spares another, badly wounded, dinosaur. Finally, an asteroid strikes Earth. In the 1940s, Mr. and Mrs. O'Brien start a family in the Waco suburbs. They have very different personalities. Jack's mother teaches him that mankind is divided into the \"way of nature\" and the \"way of grace\"—a view analogous to, but not precisely, complementarianism. Jack sees his mother as the embodiment of grace: kind, forgiving, and nurturing. She presents the world to her sons as a place of wonder. Jack sees his father as the embodiment of nature: hot-tempered, tough, and stern. He teaches his sons to fight and to not trust people easily. As Jack grows older, he learns that his parents are frustrated with their lives. Mr. O'Brien finds his career unfulfilling, as his true passion is music. He spends his free time inventing gadgets and hopes to start his own business. One of the inventions looks promising, but after Mr. O'Brien loses a patent suit, nothing changes. Mrs. O'Brien lives under the thumb of her domineering husband, who screams at her and blames her for not disciplining the boys enough. He worries that her kindness, which contrasts with his discipline, has caused his sons to hate him. As a teenager, Jack begins to question his parents' philosophy of life. The death of his friend Taylor shakes his faith in the goodness of God. He resents his father, who harshly disciplines him but cuts R.L. slack because of their shared love of music. He criticizes his mother for failing to stand up to his father. When Mr. O'Brien goes on a business trip, a weight is lifted from the family's shoulders. The boys happily play with their mother. However, without his father's discipline, Jack's rebellious streak emerges. Peer-pressured, Jack commits vandalism and animal abuse, and steals a nightgown from his crush's house. Mr. O'Brien's plant shuts down, forcing the family to relocate. Before leaving the house for the last time, Mr. O'Brien has a moment of self-reflection. He asks Jack to forgive him for his harshness, and tries to conciliate Jack by telling him that he takes after his mother. However, Jack insists that he better resembles his father. Returning to 2010, Jack has a vision of a young girl, accompanied by himself as a child, walking across desolate terrain. He walks through a wooden door frame and sees a view of the far distant future in which the Sun expands into a red giant, engulfing Earth and then shrinking into a white dwarf. The dead return to life and gather at the seaside, where Jack is reunited with his family and all those who populate his memory. Jack meets his brothers and brings R.L. to his parents, who embrace him as a long-lost son. Accompanied by two girls in white, Mrs. O'Brien gracefully whispers, \"I give him to you. I give you my son.\" Jack's vision ends and he leaves his office, smiling contentedly. The mysterious light continues flickering in the darkness. Malick released an extended version of the film in September 2018, which incorporates unused footage from the original film shoot. Although Malick maintains that the theatrical edition is the official director's cut, the extended version expands on the character of Mr. O'Brien and broadly questions Mrs. O'Brien's either-or distinction between nature and grace. Additional plot elements include: * In the present day, the film fills in details of Jack's life as he wanders around Dallas. Although he cheats on his wife, he tries to look after his teenage son. * Mrs. O'Brien once aspired to be a scientist, but gave it up to be a housewife. * Mr. O'Brien is haunted by his memories of his own father, a Navy veteran who was unsuccessful in civilian life. Terrified of ending up like his father, he pushes himself to make it big in business. * Mr. O'Brien spends more time playing with his sons and teaching them to love music like he does. * Mrs. O'Brien's brother Ray visits the family. Although Ray, like Mr. O'Brien, has a masculine demeanor, he does not fit into the \"way of nature\" paradigm, and harshly criticizes Mr. O'Brien for mistreating his nephews. Mr. O'Brien is jealous of how much his sons like Ray, and criticizes Ray for his unsuccessful career. * Jack visits a friend's house and sees that the O'Briens are not the only family in Waco with domestic tensions. * Jack's increasing rebelliousness leads him to become an inattentive student. As Jack declines academically, Mr. O'Brien realizes his own deficiencies as a father. To give Jack another chance in a better environment, he sends Jack to boarding school. One of the final scenes shows Jack exploring the campus of Malick's alma mater, St. Stephen's Episcopal School in Austin.",

At the gun shop, a bystander delivers a soliloquy about a certain type of pistol that allows people to \"kill with impunity,\" and given that ability, \"if we’re licensed to be monsters we end up having just one desire – to truly be monsters.\" When Cheyenne eventually tracks Lange down with the aid of Mordecai, Lange, now blind, says that he received mail from Cheyenne's father for decades. Lange recounts the incident that led to Cheyenne's father's obsession with Lange, in which Cheyenne's father peed his pants from fear. Lange describes this as a \"minor incident\" in comparison to the true horrors of Auschwitz, but mentions that he came to admire the man's single-minded determination to dedicate his life to making his own miserable. Cheyenne takes a photo of Lange and whispers that it was an injustice for his father to die before Lange did. Cheyenne forces the old blind man to walk out into the salt flats naked, like a Holocaust victim; skin and bones and numb with fear. Cheyenne and Mordecai drive away soon afterwards, leaving him still standing in the flats. Cheyenne travels home by airplane, now free from his fear of flying. He cuts his rock-star hair and stops wearing his goth make-up, jewelry, and outfits.",

    "Synopsis": "On the death of the pope, the conclave meets in Rome. Early ballots end with black smoke, since none of the main candidates reaches the quorum. After several rounds of voting, Cardinal Melville is elected, though he had not previously been considered a frontrunner. After a moment of hesitation, he accepts his election and becomes pope immediately. At the moment of the public announcement, with the faithful gathering in St. Peter's Square and the cardinal protodeacon ready to announce the name of the new pope, the newly elected pope has a panic attack and fails to appear on the balcony. The spokesman of the Holy See evades questions from the press and the curiosity of the outside world by reporting that the new pontiff felt the need to sequester himself in prayer and reflection before being introduced to the public, and by explaining that he will make his official appearance within a few hours. This does not happen. In accordance with the laws of the Church, until the identity of the new pope is announced publicly, the ceremony of election is not over and no one in the conclave can leave the Vatican (in reality, the conclave ends the moment the pope assents to his election). The College of Cardinals, deeply concerned by the crisis and the depression from which the new pope seems to be suffering, calls in the psychoanalyst Professor Brezzi. The cardinals react to the psychoanalyst with some suspicion, but still allow him to examine the new pope. Brezzi, in the presence of the cardinals, tries to initiate a psychotherapy session which, however, fails to reveal anything to explain the depression and helplessness that plague the pontiff. Brezzi reveals that his ex-wife is also a psychoanalyst and the newly elected pope is taken secretly to see her. After meeting with her he escapes his minders and runs away during a walk. Unaware of his absence, the cardinals kill time by playing games, ranging from cards to an international volleyball tournament organized by Brezzi. The spokesman makes everyone believe that the Pope is in his quarters in prayer, and eventually the cardinals find Melville and give him another chance to announce his acceptance. Melville comes out onto the balcony claiming \"I am not the leader you need\", asks the crowd to pray \"for what he is about to do\", and then retreats back into St. Peter's Basilica.",

    "Synopsis": "Eva Khatchadourian, once a successful travel writer, lives alone in a rundown house and works in a travel agency near a prison, where she visits her son, Kevin, who has been convicted of mass-murdering students at his high school. As she copes with the hostility of her neighbors, she reflects upon her memories of raising him. Despite being a reluctant mother, Eva decides to start a family with Franklin, giving birth to Kevin. From childhood, Eva views Kevin as detached and difficult. He appears to loathe and deliberately antagonize Eva, who struggles to bond with him. As a baby, he cries incessantly, but only around her; as a child, he resists toilet training, rebuffs Eva's attempts at affection, and shows no interest in anything. He behaves like a happy, loving son in front of his father, Franklin, who dismisses Eva's concerns and makes excuses for Kevin's behavior. One day, Eva's frustration with Kevin drives her to throw him against the wall, breaking his arm. Kevin tells Franklin he fell and uses the incident to manipulate Eva. When Kevin is confined to bed with a fever, he shows affection towards Eva for the first time as she reads Robin Hood, though his spiteful personality returns as soon as he recovers. Franklin gives Kevin a bow and arrow and teaches him archery. Sometime later, Eva gives birth to her and Franklin's second child, Celia, a lively and cheerful girl towards whom Kevin is instantly disdainful. A few years later, Celia's pet guinea pig mysteriously goes missing. Eva finds its remains in the garbage disposal the next day, which she unclogs with drain cleaner. Celia is blinded in one eye after being exposed to the cleaner while Kevin was tasked with watching her, requiring her to wear a glass eye in its place. Eva suspects Kevin injured his sister on purpose, but Franklin defends him. Tired of Eva's distrust of their son, Franklin discusses divorce with her, and Kevin overhears their conversation. Three days before his 16th birthday, Kevin uses bicycle locks to trap several students in the school gymnasium and murders them with his bow and arrows. After witnessing Kevin's arrest and the bodies of his victims being carried away, Eva returns home to discover that Kevin has murdered Franklin and Celia as well. On the second anniversary of the massacre, Eva visits Kevin in prison. His demeanor has changed to demure and frightened in anticipation of turning 18 and being transferred to an adult prison. Eva asks him why he committed the murders. Kevin responds that he used to think he knew but is no longer sure. An officer informs that the visit time is over. Eva embraces Kevin and leaves.",

    "Synopsis": "After residents of a Paris apartment building complain of a smell coming from one of the apartments, the emergency services break down its door to find an elderly woman's corpse in the bedroom, adorned with cut flowers. Several months before the opening scene, Anne and her husband Georges, both retired piano teachers in their eighties, attend a performance by one of Anne's former pupils, Alexandre. They return home to find that someone has unsuccessfully tried to break into their apartment. The next morning, while they are eating breakfast, Anne silently has a stroke. She sits in a catatonic state, not responding to Georges. She comes around as Georges is about to get help, but has no idea the stroke occurred. Georges is unable to persuade her to get medical attention until Anne finds she is unable to pour herself a drink. Anne undergoes surgery on a blocked carotid artery, but the surgery goes wrong, leaving her paralyzed on her right side and reliant on a wheelchair. She makes Georges promise not to send her back to the hospital or to a nursing home. Georges becomes Anne's dutiful, though slightly irritated, caretaker. One day, Anne, seemingly having attempted to commit suicide by falling from a window, tells Georges she doesn't want to go on living. Alexandre, her former pupil whose performance they attended, stops by and Anne gets dressed up and carries on a lively conversation during the visit, giving Georges hope that her condition was temporary. But she soon has a second stroke that leaves her demented and incapable of coherent speech. Georges continues to look after Anne. Georges begins employing a nurse three days a week. Their daughter, Eva, wants her mother to go into care, but Georges says he will not break the promise he made to Anne. He employs a second nurse, but fires her after he discovers she is mistreating Anne. One day, Georges sits next to Anne's bedside and tells her a story of his childhood, which calms her. As Anne closes her eyes, he quietly picks up a pillow and smothers her to death. Georges returns home with bundles of flowers in his hands, which he proceeds to wash and cut. He picks out a dress from Anne's wardrobe and writes a long letter. He tapes the bedroom door shut and catches a pigeon that has flown in through the window. In the letter, Georges explains that he has released the pigeon. Georges imagines that Anne is washing dishes in the kitchen and, speechless, he gazes at her as she cleans up and prepares to leave the house. Anne calls for Georges to bring a coat, and he complies, following her out of the door. The film concludes with a continuation of the opening scene, with Eva seated in the living room after wandering around the now-empty home.",

    "Synopsis": "Two Romanian orphaned young women, Voichița and Alina, visit a Romanian Orthodox convent during Lent, where Voichița tells Alina the altar includes an icon that grants wishes. Alina had been working in Germany, and the two girls were previously roommates at a children's home and had shared a physical relationship. The monastery is led by a 30-year-old Priest who speaks ill of declining faith in Western Europe, citing same-sex marriage, and forbids anyone outside of the faith from entering. He inquires about Alina to Voichița, who tells him Alina irregularly attends church and does not go to confession. They urge Alina to begin confessing. Alina hopes to sleep with Voichița, but Voichița tells her they must be cautious given it is Lent. Some time later after Alina has left the convent, Voichița retrieves her, but Voichița tells Alina she is now a nun, that she has chosen to be with God so she will never be alone, and her love of Alina is different from before. They return to the convent, but Alina asks Voichița that they escape together. After Voichița refuses, Alina attempts to jump down a well, but is restrained by the nuns and taken to the hospital. There, doctors restrain Alina to prevent her self-harm, after which they send her back to the convent to assist with recovery. There, the nuns read to Alina about sin. Alina begins a Black Fast, but when the Priest learns of this when Alina is not at the table, they see Alina is attempting to enter the altar to make a wish to the icon. The Priest admits the icon exists, but says entering the altar is a severe sin, and tells the nuns the Devil is in Alina and the convent. Alina remains tied down to a board with chains and towels. The nuns witness a worsening in her condition and take her back to the hospital. There, the hospital staff find Alina is dead on arrival, and observe the wounds on her wrists and ankles from the restraints. The staff tells the nuns this constitutes homicide and threatens to call the police and media. An officer investigates the convent. Seeing the board Alina was tied to, the officer interprets it as a cross. The officer also says forcible restraint leading to death is a homicide. The Priest denies criminal intent, saying the restraints were to prevent self-harm, and invoking the analogy of a parent's right to force children to take medicine, though the officer replies Alina was not a child and the Priest was not her guardian. The nuns also cite Alina's strength as mysterious, but Voichița says Alina studied martial arts. The police take the Priest and the nuns who tied up Alina away, with Voichița choosing to go with them.",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- Please see WP:FILMPLOT. Plot summaries are recommended to be 400-700 words. --> Twenty-eight-year-old billionaire and currency speculator Eric Packer rides slowly across Manhattan amid traffic jams, in his state-of-the-art luxury stretch limousine office, to his preferred barber. Various visitors discuss the meaning of life and inconsequential trivia. The traffic jams are caused by a visit of the President of the United States and the funeral of Eric's favorite musician, a rap artist whose music he plays in one of his two private elevators. Despite devastating currency speculation losses over the course of the day, Packer fantasizes about buying the Rothko Chapel. He meets his wife, Elise, in her taxi, for coffee, in a bookstore, as well as outside a theater. She declines sex with him. Packer has sex with two other women. When a day of poor trading destroys a large part of his wealth, his wife takes this as a reason to dissolve their union. Anti-capitalist activists demonstrate on the street. They wave rats and declare, \"A spectre is haunting the world: the spectre of capitalism\". They spray-paint Packer's limo and later subject him to a pieing. Packer learns that an assassin has targeted him but seems uninterested in who the person might be. In Eric's car, his doctor performs his daily medical checkup. Eric worries about the doctor's finding that he has an asymmetrical prostate. As the currency speculation wipes out most of his fortune, Eric's world begins to disintegrate. Eventually he kills his bodyguard. At the destination, the barber, who knew his father, cuts Eric's hair on one side. The barber and limo driver discuss their respective careers driving cabs. The barber gives Eric his gun because he threw away the bodyguard's. Eric follows a path of further self-destruction, visiting his potential murderer, former employee Richard Sheets, a.k.a. Benno Levin. Eric seems ready to commit suicide, but instead deliberately shoots himself in the hand. Sheets, who feels adrift in the capitalist system, explains that Eric's mistake in speculating was looking for perfect symmetry and patterns in the currency market: he should have looked for the lopsided—his body with its asymmetrical prostate was telling him this. As Sheets points the gun to Eric's head, Eric seems to have overcome his fear of death as he waits for Sheets to pull the trigger. Eric's fate is left unknown.",

    "Synopsis": "A man wakes up and finds a secret door in his hotel room. He opens it and wanders into a movie theater full of sleeping patrons. A naked child and several dogs wander the aisles. Meanwhile, in Paris, a rich man waves goodbye to his family and gets into a white limousine. His driver, Céline, calls him Mr. Oscar and tells him he has nine appointments that day. He reads a file, uncovers a mirror, and begins to brush a grey wig. Over the course of the day, he: * plays an old woman beggar on the Pont Alexandre III. * dons a motion capture suit and enters an empty sound stage, where he performs action sequences while being directed by an unseen man. A woman in a motion capture suit enters, and the pair perform movements that are used to create a sex scene between animated snakelike creatures. * plays the role of Monsieur Merde, an eccentric and violent red-haired man who lives in the sewers and kidnaps a beautiful model called Kay M. from a photo shoot in a cemetery. * plays a father who picks up his daughter from a party in an old red car. They argue when the daughter reveals she spent the party hiding in the bathroom instead of socializing. * (as an interlude) plays a song on the accordion in a church with an ever-growing group of musicians. * plays a gangster assigned to murder a man who looks identical to him. After he has stabbed the man in the neck and carved scars into the man's face that match his own, the victim suddenly stabs Oscar in the neck. Oscar manages to limp his way back to the limousine, seemingly severely injured. While Oscar is removing his makeup, a man with a port-wine stain on his face reveals his presence in the limo. The man asks Oscar if he still enjoys his work, since he has looked \"tired\" recently. Oscar admits it is harder now that he cannot see the cameras, but says he continues for \"the beauty of the act\". * yells at Céline to stop, runs from the limo wearing a red balaclava covered with barbed wire, and shoots a banker who looks just like he did in the morning when he left for his first appointment. He is gunned down by the banker's bodyguards and Céline rushes to him. As she leads him away, she apologizes and says there has been a mix-up. * plays the elderly \"Mr. Vogan\", who enters a hotel and gets into bed in one of the rooms. Vogan's niece Léa enters, they talk about their lives, and he dies. While Léa cries, Oscar gets out of bed and excuses himself to go to another appointment. He asks Léa her real name, and she says it is Élise and that she also has another appointment. * (in what does not seem to be one of his appointments) is almost hit by another white limousine, whose female passenger he recognizes. Still in pajamas, Oscar asks if they can talk, and they go to the abandoned La Samaritaine building, where Jean (the woman) says they have 20 minutes to catch up on the past 20 years before her \"partner\" arrives and she will play the last night of an air hostess named Eva Grace. As they ascend to the roof of the building, she sings a wistful song that indicates she and Oscar \"once had a child\". Oscar leaves her and, avoiding the male partner on the staircase, returns to his limo. When he sees that Eva and the partner have jumped to their deaths from the top of the building, he lets out an anguished cry and runs past them and directly back into the limo as he does so. * plays a man whose wife and children are chimpanzees. Alone, Céline drives to the Holy Motors garage, which is filled with other limousines. She parks, places a teal mask on her face, and leaves. The moment she is gone, the limousines begin to talk to one another, expressing fear that they are outdated and unwanted.",

The bored younger woman sets out to write a screenplay whose plot will use the place they're staying in for the location, but eventually comes up with three variants, using the same basic idea in all of them. In each case, Won-joo's protagonist is a \"charming French visitor\" named Anne (Isabelle Huppert): in the first section, she's a famous filmmaker visiting a fellow Korean director Jong-soo (Kwon Hae-hyo) and his very pregnant and jealous wife Geum-hee (Moon So-ri); in the second, she's the wife of a French motor company executive who comes to the same guesthouse to meet her lover, a Korean filmmaker, Moon-soo (Moon Sung-keun); in the third, she's a divorced housewife who arrives with her university lecturer friend Park Soon (again Youn Yuh-jung) for some peace and quiet, after her husband left her for his young Korean secretary. Issues of infidelity are present in each story, as is a dim but muscular lifeguard (Yoo Jun-sang) whom Anne meets while strolling on the beach and looking (in all three episodes) for a mini-lighthouse. As each \"Anne\" interacts with the locals, including Won-joo, who works at Anne's lodging and helps show her around, certain faces, situations and lines of dialogue recur, their effect and implications changing depending on context and delivery.",

    "Synopsis": "During the 2008 financial crisis and 2008 United States presidential election, Johnny \"Squirrel\" Amato plans to rob a Mafia-controlled private poker game in Boston. He enlists Frankie, a former business associate, and Russell, a heroin-addicted Australian immigrant who steals purebred dogs to sell in Florida. They target a game run by Markie Trattman, who is known to have previously orchestrated an inside job by paying two men to rob his own illegal poker game. Squirrel anticipates that Markie will be the obvious suspect, and the crime syndicate Markie is involved with will simply have him killed without investigating further. Though obviously inexperienced, Frankie and Russell successfully carry out the armed robbery, and escape with approximately $100,000. “The Driver”, a mob lawyer who reports to the group running the crime syndicate, discusses with hitman Jackie Cogan on how to deal with the situation created by the robbery: mob-operated poker games have stopped as players fear more violence, throwing the underground criminal economy into chaos. Although Jackie correctly intuits Markie was innocent, he believes Markie needs to die regardless, as if no example is made it would encourage further robberies by street level thugs. Driver pushes back strongly on having Markie murdered and Jackie reluctantly agrees to only having him beaten. Meanwhile, Russell travels to Florida with a man named Kenny Gill to sell the stolen dogs. While trying to recruit Kenny as a drug dealer, Russell inadvertently reveals his involvement in the heist. Kenny, being acquainted with a hitman named Dillon who knows both Jackie and Driver, informs Dillon that Russell, Frankie, and Squirrel are the perpetrators. Jackie finally convinces Driver that Markie must die, and with Kenny driving, Jackie kills Markie from the rear seat of the car. Three targets remain: Russell, Frankie, and Squirrel, but Jackie is reluctant to take the hit on Squirrel, as he and Jackie are acquainted. Jackie convinces Driver to bring in another hitman, Mickey Fallon, of whom Jackie speaks highly. While explaining why he wants to hire Mickey, Jackie explains to Driver his philosophy of \"killing them softly\", killing his targets from a distance or in ways which allow them no chance to experience fear, despair or suffering of any kind. Mickey, holed up in an expensive hotel room, indulges in binge drinking and sex with prostitutes instead of carrying out the hit. Admitting to Jackie how he violated his parole to be out of state, Jackie arranges Mickey's arrest and extradition back to New York, deciding to kill Squirrel himself. Before Jackie gets to him, Russell is arrested on a drug possession charge. Meanwhile, Jackie confronts Frankie and convinces him to trade Squirrel's whereabouts for his life. Jackie has Frankie drive him to where Squirrel will have his regular rendezvous with a woman, and he kills Squirrel with a shotgun. After confirming Squirrel is dead, Jackie and Frankie drive to the parking garage where Jackie shoots Frankie in the head without warning. Jackie wipes down the car and leaves the scene. On the night of the presidential election, Jackie meets with Driver to collect his fee for the three hits. On the TV in the bar, Barack Obama is giving his election victory speech. The two argue over his fee, with Driver trying to pay a lesser amount. Jackie mocks Obama's words on community, declaring that America \"is just a business\", and demands the full sum.",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. --> In 1931, the Bondurant brothers — middle brother Forrest, eldest brother Howard, and youngest brother Jack — are running a successful moonshine business in Franklin County, Virginia. The brothers use their gas station and restaurant as a front for dealing with the assistance of Cricket, Jack's mechanically gifted friend who builds and maintains their stills. Jack witnesses rum-runner Floyd Banner shoot dead two federal agents in broad daylight for trying to arrest him. Forrest hires Maggie, a financially struggling dancer, as a waitress. Shortly afterward, the gas station is visited by newly appointed U.S. Marshal Charley Rakes, accompanied by the sheriff and corrupt state's attorney Mason Wardell. Rakes demands that he and Wardell receive a cut of profits from all bootleggers within the county, including Forrest, in exchange for ignoring their operations. Forrest refuses and implores his fellow bootleggers to unite against Rakes, but they refuse. Meanwhile, Jack lusts after Bertha, daughter of the local Brethren preacher. He attends their church service drunk, embarrassing himself but piquing her interest. Jack walks in on a visit from Rakes to Cricket's house and is beaten by him as a message to his brothers. Later that night, Forrest throws out two drunk customers who had been harassing and threatening Maggie. After Maggie leaves, Forrest is ambushed by the two men, who slit his throat. Maggie returns looking for Forrest but is beaten and raped by the men. She hides the assault from Forrest, not wanting him to take revenge. While Forrest recovers at a hospital, Jack, deciding to retire from bootlegging rather than cross Rakes any further, crosses the county line with Cricket to sell their remaining liquor. They get ambushed by Banner and his crew but are spared when Jack reveals he is a Bondurant, whom Banner admires for their stance against Rakes. Banner reveals to Jack the address of his brother's assailants, revealing that both men are former bootleggers who escaped punishment for their crimes by working as deputy marshals for Rakes. Forrest and Howard find, torture, and kill the men and send one of their testicles to Rakes. Banner becomes a regular client of the brothers, who invest their profits into setting up larger stills deep in the woods. Jack continues to court Bertha. Maggie decides to return to Chicago, but Forrest convinces her to stay and provides her with a spare room; they soon develop a romantic relationship. On a day trip, Jack decides to show Bertha the brothers' secret operation, but they are followed and ambushed by Rakes and his officers. Howard and Jack flee but Cricket and Bertha are caught. The police take Bertha home, while Cricket has his neck snapped by Rakes. After Cricket's funeral, the sheriff warns the Bondurants that Rakes has set up a blockade at the bridge to trap them while Wardell arranges for Prohibition agents to round up every bootlegger in the county. Jack speeds off in Cricket's car to confront Rakes. Howard and Forrest quickly follow to provide backup, to Maggie's chagrin. She reveals she had delivered him to the hospital after the attack and Forrest realizes that she had been raped. Jack arrives at the bridge but is wounded by Rakes. Howard and Forrest arrive, and a shootout ensues, during which Forrest and his driver are also wounded, the latter fatally. A convoy of bootleggers arrive and hold the lawmen at gunpoint. Rakes ignores them and attempts to execute Forrest but is shot in the leg by the sheriff in an attempt to halt the bloodshed. Rakes turns to leave the scene, but suddenly turns around and shoots Forrest several times. The convoy opens fire on Rakes, but he runs into a covered bridge. Since he is unable to run far, the badly wounded Jack and Howard follow and plunge a knife into Rakes' back, killing him. Following the end of Prohibition in 1933, Wardell is arrested on corruption charges while the Bondurants are all married — Jack to Bertha, Forrest to Maggie, and Howard to a Martinsville woman — and working in legitimate occupations. During a festive reunion at Jack's house sometime later, Forrest drunkenly ambles to a frozen lake and falls into the freezing water. Although he drags himself out, he later dies of pneumonia, putting to rest the legend of his invincibility.",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should remain between 400-700 words. Work within the limit and DO NOT ADD --> On the New England island of New Penzance, 12-year-old orphan Sam Shakusky attends Camp Ivanhoe, a Khaki Scout summer camp led by Scout Master Randy Ward. Suzy Bishop, also 12, lives on the island with her parents Walt and Laura, both lawyers, and her three younger brothers in a house called Summer's End. Sam and Suzy, both introverted, intelligent, and mature for their age, meet in the summer of 1964 during a church performance of Noye's Fludde and become pen pals. The relationship becomes romantic over the course of their correspondence, and they make a secret pact to reunite and run away together. In September 1965, they execute their plan. Sam escapes from Camp Ivanhoe while Suzy runs away from Summer's End. The pair rendezvous, hike, camp, and fish in the wilderness with the goal of reaching a specific location. Meanwhile, the Khaki Scouts have become aware of Sam's absence, finding a letter he left behind stating he has resigned. Scout Master Ward tells the Khaki Scouts to use their skills to set up a search party and find Sam. Island Police Captain Duffy Sharp and Ward contact Sam's guardians the Billingsleys, learning they are actually his foster parents and Sam is an orphan with a history of behavioral issues at home. Eventually, a group of Khaki Scouts confronts Sam and Suzy and tries to capture them. During the resulting altercation, Suzy injures the Scouts' de facto leader Redford with a pair of scissors, and a stray arrow fired by one of the Scouts kills Camp Ivanhoe's dog Snoopy. The Scouts flee, and Sam and Suzy hike to Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet which they name \"Moonrise Kingdom.\" They set up camp and as the romantic tension between them grows, they dance on the beach and share each other's first kiss. Suzy's parents, Ward, the Scouts, and Sharp finally find Sam and Suzy in their tent the next morning. Suzy's parents take her home. Ward gives Sam a letter from the Billingsleys stating that they no longer wish to house Sam. He stays with Sharp while they await the arrival of a Social Services worker, who will likely place Sam in an orphanage and possibly treat him with electroshock therapy. While in their treehouse, the Camp Ivanhoe Scouts have a change of heart and decide to help Suzy and Sam. They help Suzy and Sam sneak out and then together paddle to neighboring St. Jack Wood Island to seek out the help of Ben, an older cousin of the scout Skotak. Ben works at Fort Lebanon, a larger Khaki Scout summer camp on St. Jack Wood Island run by Ward's superior, Commander Pierce. Ben decides to try to take Sam and Suzy to a crabbing boat anchored off the island so that Sam can work as a crewman and avoid Social Services. He performs a wedding ceremony, which he claims is not \"legally\" binding, before they leave. Sam, Suzy, and Ben set off for the crabbing boat in a sailboat, but quickly return so that Sam can retrieve Suzy's binoculars. As Sam returns to the camp chapel to look for the binoculars, he is confronted by Redford, who alerts the camp to Sam and Suzy's presence. Suzy's parents, Captain Sharp, Social Services, and the Scouts of Fort Lebanon, under the command of Ward, pursue them. A violent hurricane and flash flood strike, and Sharp apprehends Sam and Suzy on the steeple of the church in which they first met. Lightning destroys the steeple, but Sharp saves them. During the storm, he decides to become Sam's legal guardian. The hurricane erases Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet from the map. At Summer's End, Sam is upstairs painting a landscape of Moonrise Kingdom. Suzy and her brothers are called to dinner, while Sam slips out of the window to join Sharp in his patrol car, telling Suzy he will see her the following day.",

    "film_title": "Mud (2012 film)",
    "Synopsis": "Ellis and Neckbone, two teenage boys living near DeWitt, Arkansas, are excited to find an abandoned boat on a small island in the Mississippi River. However, the boat is already inhabited by a man named Mud, whom the boys encounter a short time later. Mud, a disheveled but charismatic vagrant, tells the boys he grew up nearby and asks for some food, promising them the boat in exchange once he is gone. Returning with food, the boys ask Mud why he is hiding out. Mud is waiting for his girlfriend Juniper, whom he describes as beautiful, with distinctive nightingale tattoos on her hands. The boys later spot Juniper in town. Ellis falls for an older girl named May Pearl. Ellis learns that his parents are heading for divorce over his mother's desire to move into town. This threatens their old river houseboat: if no longer used as a residence by the owner, it will be demolished by the River Authority. Later, at a roadblock, Ellis finds out Mud is a wanted fugitive, but denies having seen him. The boys confront Mud over the discovery. Mud explains that he killed a man who had gotten Juniper pregnant and pushed her down a flight of stairs, causing her to lose the child. Mud now plans to use the boat to escape and promises the boys his pistol instead for their continued assistance. Mud sends Ellis to Tom Blankenship, an older father figure from his childhood and Ellis's neighbor, for help. Tom agrees to talk to Mud; however, upon learning Mud is in trouble over Juniper again, he refuses to help. Mud gives the boys a note for Juniper. They find her motel room where Carver—the brother of the man Mud killed—is abusing her. Ellis and Neckbone tell Mud about the man, and Mud realizes that the family of the man he killed has come for revenge. Stealing machine parts and an outboard motor from junkyards, the boys help Mud repair the boat, and coordinate a plan with Juniper to bring her to Mud so they can escape together down the river. On the designated day, Juniper does not show up. Ellis and Neck find her flirting with another man at a nearby bar and tell Mud what has happened. Ellis brings a note from Mud to Juniper, telling her he accepts that it's over between them. Juniper tells Ellis that she loves Mud, but that he is a born liar and she cannot spend the rest of her life following his itinerant lifestyle. Ellis is deeply disillusioned by the sudden dissolution of what he believed to be a couple deeply in love. Soon after, May Pearl rejects and humiliates Ellis in front of her friends. These events seem to confirm for Ellis his father's admonishment, in the wake of the pending divorce, that women cannot be trusted. Ellis confronts Mud and calls him a liar and a coward for giving up on Juniper. Running away, Ellis falls into a pit containing cottonmouths and is bitten. Mud jumps in and rescues him, racing to get the unconscious Ellis to a clinic on the mainland. Recognizing Mud, one of the hospital employees calls the police, who tip off Carver and his father King. Evading his pursuers, Mud gets back to the island where he and Neckbone launch the repaired boat into the water. As they agreed, Mud gives Neckbone his pistol but without ammunition. Mud wants to say goodbye to Ellis, so Neckbone takes him to Ellis's family's houseboat, where he is recovering. Mud sneaks into Ellis's room, and Ellis tells Mud he is sorry for what he said. Mud replies Ellis was right about most of what he said, and that he is not a good man. Ellis then shares his father's advice about women. Mud disagrees, and says that Ellis is a good man and if he finds a girl half as good as he is, he'll be alright. While Mud is in Ellis's room, Carver and his posse arrive and start shooting. Tom, a former Marine marksman, fires from his boat using his old sniper rifle, killing several attackers from across the river. Mud saves Ellis and tries to get away but is shot as he dives into the river. The police arrive and find all the posse members dead. One trooper calls King to tell him that his other son is now dead. Police divers search for Mud's body all night. The morning after the shootout, Tom disappears. Ellis's parents separate. He and his mother move to an apartment in town and Ellis's father gets a new job far away. Ellis and Neckbone watch the houseboat get demolished as Ellis shares that he is uncertain of Mud's fate but still believes he was protecting Juniper. As Ellis's father departs, he tells Ellis to take care of his mother because this change is hard on her too, showing a more mature and changed attitude toward their situation. He assures Ellis he'll see him again in a week and tells Ellis he loves him, to which Ellis reciprocates. Ellis sees some attractive older teenage girls in his new neighborhood – one of them waves to him and he smiles. Several days later, Mud is revealed to be alive and recovering on the repaired boat, driven by Tom. They look ahead at the mouth of the Mississippi River, and south of that, the Gulf of Mexico.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1947 New York, on the day his father is buried, Sal Paradise is out with his friend Carlo Marx who is, like him, an aspiring writer. They're invited by mutual friend Chad to meet Dean Moriarty, a young car thief from Denver, and Dean's 16-year-old wife Marylou. Sal and Carlo befriend Dean, smoking marijuana with him and visiting a jazz nightclub where they meet saxophonist Walter, who also befriends them. Sal teaches Dean how to write before Dean leaves for Denver with Carlo. After much contemplation, writer's block, and a solemn visit to his father's grave, Sal decides to join his friends in Denver and embarks on the road for the first time. There, Sal meets Camille, an art college student for whom Dean is divorcing Marylou. Carlo starts to question his sexuality, and Carlo and Dean start an affair. Carlo, Sal, Camille, and Dean visit a bar where Dean plays \"I've Got the World on a String\" on the jukebox, and Camille bonds with Sal. Carlo tells Sal he thinks he might be gay, and he plans to travel to Africa. Sal leaves aboard a bus and meets Terry. The two travel to California, where Terry works on cotton fields with her family while Sal helps. Sal and Terry have a brief affair before Sal, realizing he isn't made to work in the fields, heads back home. In December 1948, Dean, Marylou, and Ed Dunkel arrive at Sal's sister's home in North Carolina, having left Ed's wife Galatea with Old Bull Lee in Louisiana. Sal's family feeds the trio, who haven't eaten for 30 hours, and the next day the trio, Sal, and Sal's mother drive back to New York. The guys and Marylou celebrate New Year's Eve at Carlo's place. Later, Dean convinces Sal to partake in a threesome with him and Marylou. Sal starts kissing Marylou, but Dean's presence makes him nervous, so he tells Dean to go to the kitchen. Following this, Dean and Marylou have sex, while Sal listens in the other room. The next day, they ride off to California and leave Ed at Bull's. When they arrive in San Francisco, Dean drives to Camille's place, leaving Sal and Marylou to rent a room, where the two have sex. The next morning, Marylou leaves to return to her sailor fiancé in Denver, and Sal goes over to visit Dean and Camille, who by now have a child together and are expecting a second. Sal and Dean visit a nightclub, leaving Camille alone to deal with the baby. When they return home, she kicks Dean out. Sal and Dean travel to Denver in search of Dean's father, but have no luck finding him. They then travel back to New York with a tall, thin salesman from whom Dean tries to get money in exchange for sex. Dean succeeds, which gives him and Sal enough money to get where they need to go. Eight months later, Dean asks Sal if he would like to drive to Mexico. When they arrive a kid gets high with them and leads them to a whorehouse, where Dean and Sal dance and have sex with some of the prostitutes. They later roam the streets getting stoned and drunk. However, Sal becomes ill from dysentery and is hospitalized. Dean then leaves Sal behind, returning to San Francisco to fix his relationship with Camille. After recovering, Sal returns to New York. In 1951, Sal meets Dean in Manhattan, on his way to a Duke Ellington concert. Dean says he traveled across the country by train to see Sal and that he is having another child with Camille. Sal's friends hurry him so they can get on their way, and as Sal turns to leave, Dean asks for a lift to East 14th Street. Sal tells Dean it was good to see him, and leaves him to walk as Sal and his friends depart. When Sal returns home that night, he is able to write his novel about his life on the road with Dean.",

    "Synopsis": "Alain \"Ali\" van Versch, an unemployed single father in his twenties, arrives in Antibes to look for work to support his young son, Sam. Having no money, he crashes with his sister Anna, a cashier who already has her own share of problems with financial instability and temporary employment. Ali gets a job as a bouncer in a nightclub, which allows him to continue his passion for kickboxing by training during the day. One evening, Ali meets Stéphanie after she is injured in a club brawl. He escorts her back to her home, where he learns she is an orca trainer at Marineland. Ali offers his phone number to Stéphanie before leaving. He later gets a new job as a security guard, where his co-worker Martial informs him of an illegal fighting racket where he can earn money in bouts. At Marineland, Stéphanie suffers an accident during a show and wakes up in the hospital to realize that her legs have been amputated. Now in a wheelchair and trying to adjust to life without her legs, Stéphanie is deeply depressed and gives Ali a call. Ali visits her and takes her to a beach, where he persuades her to go swimming; though hesitant at first, Stéphanie eventually forgets her self-consciousness and is liberated by the experience. Ali and Stéphanie begin to spend more time together, and her self-image improves. After she is outfitted with artificial limbs, she persists in learning to walk again. Stéphanie learns about Ali's involvement in mixed martial arts and has him bring her to watch his fights. After a frank discussion with Stéphanie, Ali offers to have sex with her to help her adjust to her new body. Their friendship evolves to include casual sex, though Stéphanie prevents deeper intimacy by forbidding kissing during their encounters. On a night out with Ali and friends at the club where Ali formerly worked, Stéphanie feels rejected when Ali dances with another woman and goes home with her. A man at the bar tries to make a pass at Stéphanie, but stops short when he sees her prosthetic legs under her skirt. The man apologizes to her, prompting Stéphanie to fly into a rage and attack him. She is escorted from the club. The next day, Stéphanie questions Ali about their relationship. She says that if they continue to have casual sex, they have to respect each other's feelings and be more discreet about their other involvements. Their intimacy increases and, one night Stéphanie lets down her guard and kisses Ali. Stéphanie also begins managing Ali's bets for his fighting when Martial leaves town. Anna is fired from her job when the managers catch her taking home expired food products. Her co-workers tell her that Ali was found installing surveillance cameras at her job, at the behest of the management so they could spy on employees' activities. Anna has a tense fight with her brother Ali, culminating in a standoff between him and her partner Richard, who demands that Ali leave Anna's flat and not come back. Out of guilt for his offense, Ali leaves town without a word to Stéphanie. He leaves Sam with Anna in order to attend a combat sports training facility near Strasbourg. Some time later, Richard drops Sam off to visit Ali for a day at the training facility. On their day together, Ali and Sam play in the snow and on a frozen lake. Ali briefly steps off the ice to relieve himself, but while he is occupied, a weak spot on the ice beneath Sam cracks open and he falls into the lake. Ali frantically tries to rescue him, and after desperately punching the ice to break the surface, he is able to pull out the unconscious boy. In the process, Ali fractures almost every bone in his hands. After carrying Sam to a hospital, Ali stays at the boy's side while he is in a coma. Sam ultimately survives the ordeal. Stéphanie, learning of Sam's accident, phones Ali at the hospital. While talking to Stéphanie, Ali breaks down in tears and confesses his love for her. As Ali narrates, he explains how broken bones normally heal stronger than before, but he knows the pain will return in his hands. After some time passes, Ali is shown celebrating a fight victory in Warsaw as Stéphanie happily watches. After the win, Ali and Stéphanie take Sam by the hand and lead him out through the revolving door of a hotel.",

Afterwards, the tour guide gives them each a dram of whisky and asks them to smell it, and Robbie is complimented on his ability to identify flavours. Mo steals several miniatures from the gift shop. Robbie, Mo, Rhino and Albert get together later for their own whisky tasting with the stolen miniatures. However, Robbie is still being pursued by his old enemy, Clancy. He is about to undergo a beating by Clancy and his followers when he is unexpectedly rescued by Leonie's father. Robbie pleads to be given one last chance but the older man tells him that it's too late, and even if he wanted to change, he cannot escape the feuds and violence of the world he grew up in. Leonie's father tells him that the only way for him to escape the cycle is to leave Glasgow altogether and go to London, but without Leonie. He offers Robbie £5,000 to sweeten the deal and leaves Robbie to think it over. At the next community service session, Harry asks Robbie if he'd like to come to a whisky tasting in Edinburgh. Mo overhears and invites herself, Albert and Rhino. Reluctantly, Harry agrees to take all four of them to Edinburgh, where they learn about a cask of priceless whisky, the Malt Mill, set to go on auction soon, and Robbie is passed a business card by a whisky collector, Thaddeus. After they leave, Mo reveals she spotted and stole documents detailing the warehouse in which the \"Malt Mill\" is kept but Robbie tells her that he is not interested in crime and is determined to stay straight for the sake of Leonie and Luke. Robbie and Leonie view a flat which they could rent for six months while the owner is away. Robbie seems touched but it is then revealed they have been followed by one of Clancy's men and Clancy will know where they are going to live. Robbie, realising that he can't continue living under threat of assault on himself and his family, begins planning to steal the Malt Mill with his community service partners. They secure an invitation to the tasting and auction, during which Robbie slopes off to the warehouse to siphon some of the whisky into empty Irn-Bru bottles, before he is interrupted by Thaddeus and Angus Dobie. Robbie covertly witnesses Thaddeus attempting to bribe Dobie into selling him some of the whisky before the cask goes on auction but he refuses and the two leave, after which Robbie then tops up the cask with cheaper whisky from an adjacent cask. At the auction, the group see Thaddeus outbid by an American, who tastes the cask, and is apparently happy with the slightly diluted blend. Afterwards, Robbie approaches Thaddeus and negotiates a sale of three bottles for £200,000, and \"a real job\". They plan to make the exchange in Glasgow, and so begin the trek home, but inadvertently break two of their four bottles during an encounter with the police. Robbie is furious, but goes ahead with meeting Thaddeus, and negotiates a sale for £100,000 and a permanent job far away from Glasgow. Afterwards, Robbie reveals to his friends that he didn't sell two bottles, but one. The scene cuts to show Harry coming home to find a bottle of Irn Bru sitting on his kitchen table next to an open window, with a note thanking him for giving him a chance, and not giving up on him and presenting his \"angels' share\", next to a newspaper piece showing a photo of the community payback group next to the cask. He smells the bottle and rejoices gleefully at the Malt Mill inside. In the final scene, Robbie and Leonie leave for Stirling in an immaculate old Volkswagen Type 2, having made temporary goodbyes to the rest of the group. After they leave, the rest of the group resolve to go get wasted. The film ends with The Proclaimers' \"500 Miles\" playing.",

    "Synopsis": "Lucas is a member of a close-knit rural Danish community. He misses his teenage son, Marcus, who mostly lives with his ex-wife, but he gets along well with the young children at the local kindergarten where he has worked since the school at which he taught closed. When Marcus says he wants to live with Lucas and Lucas starts to date Nadja, a co-worker, his fortunes seem to be looking up. Klara, who is the daughter of Lucas' best friend Theo as well as a pupil at Lucas' kindergarten, has a tendency to wander off on her own when her parents argue, and Lucas occasionally happens upon her when she is alone and helps her out. He accommodates her aversion to stepping on cracks and says she can walk his dog Fanny whenever she wants. Over time, Klara develops a crush on Lucas. When she kisses him on the mouth and gives him a small gift, he gently rebuffs her, and she becomes dejected. Using details from a pornographic picture shown to her by a friend of her older brother, Klara makes comments that lead Grethe, the director of the kindergarten, to believe Lucas exposed himself to her. Grethe invites an acquaintance to interview Klara, and after Klara nods in response to the man's leading questions, Grethe, who does not believe that children lie about such things, alerts the authorities and informs the parents of the children who attend the kindergarten. Klara later contradicts her initial story, but the adults see this as stemming from denial of what happened to her. Lucas loses his job, his friendship with Theo is destroyed, and he is shunned by the community as a child molester and outcast. Due to the vague language used and the secrecy around the investigation, he does not know specifically what he is supposed to have done, but he eventually hears he may have been accused of abusing multiple children. The strain of this revelation leads him to break up with Nadja when he thinks she doubts his innocence. Marcus runs away from his mother to be with Lucas. After a trip to the grocery store, where he is told that neither he nor his father are welcome anymore, he sees Lucas being arrested by the police. Locked out of the house, Marcus goes to ask Theo for a spare key and ends up fighting with several adults for confronting Klara and asking why she lied about his father. He is taken in by Bruun, one of Lucas' friends, who believes Lucas is innocent. Bruun tells Marcus that Lucas has a hearing in the morning and he is hopeful the case against Lucas will be dropped, since he has heard that all of the children's accounts of their abuse mention the same details of the basement of Lucas' house, which does not have a basement. Lucas is released from custody, but someone kills his dog and throws a large stone through his window, so he sends Marcus back to his ex-wife and buries Fanny. On Christmas Eve, the staff of the grocery store beat him up and throw him out; however, he returns and headbutts the butcher to get his groceries back and buy them. Theo and his wife see Lucas limp out of the store bleeding from his head, and Lucas later notices them whispering during the Christmas church service. Lucas attacks Theo in front of the congregation and challenges him to look in his eyes for a sign he is lying about his innocence, since Theo had previously stated he can always tell when Lucas is lying. Lucas is escorted out of the church. When Theo visits Klara in her bedroom that night, she reaffirms that Lucas did not do anything bad to her. Theo brings Lucas food and alcohol, and the two men sit together and talk. By the next fall, tensions in the community have lessened, Lucas' friends greet him again as before, and he and Nadja have gotten back together. Marcus receives his first rifle at a ceremony at Bruun's house. Afterwards Lucas and Klara reunite, and he carries her in his arms so she doesn't have to step on cracks. The adult men go hunting on the surrounding estate. When Lucas is by himself, a bullet barely misses him and hits a tree. He turns and watches as the shooter, silhouetted against the sun, reloads his rifle and points it at Lucas for a moment before fleeing. Lucas stands next to the bullet hole in silence, and the film ends.",

    "Synopsis": "In the summer of 1969, Anita, former maid of the Jansen family, recounts the events surrounding Ward Jansen, an idealistic reporter for The Miami Times, who returns to his hometown of Lately, Florida, to investigate the controversial murder conviction of Hillary Van Wetter, a brutish alligator hunter sentenced to death for the 1965 killing of a corrupt local sheriff. Ward and his colleague, Yardley Acheman—an English-accented journalist—aim to expose procedural flaws in the trial, including lost evidence they attribute to systemic injustice. Their efforts intersect with Charlotte Bless, an Alabama woman who, after exchanging letters with Van Wetter, believes him innocent and plans to marry him upon his exoneration. Ward enlists his younger brother, Jack, as a driver for the investigation. Jack, a college dropout working as a paperboy for their estranged father W.W.’s local newspaper, becomes infatuated with Charlotte. Their relationship is complicated by Charlotte’s open sexuality; she rebuffs Jack’s advances to preserve their friendship, though she later saves his life after a jellyfish sting by urinating on his wounds—an act sensationalized by W.W. in his newspaper, sparking tension between Jack and Yardley. During a subsequent altercation, Jack directs a racial slur at Yardley, straining their rapport and unsettling Anita, Jack’s confidante and maternal figure since his mother’s departure. The investigation leads the group to Van Wetter’s uncle, Tyree, a reclusive swamp dweller. Tyree reluctantly provides an alibi, claiming he and Van Wetter were stealing sod from an Ormond Beach golf course the night of the murder. While Yardley asserts he verified the alibi with an anonymous developer, Ward grows suspicious of Yardley’s motives. His doubts intensify after a violent incident at a bar leaves Ward severely beaten. Jack, witnessing the aftermath, attacks one assailant but is unable to prevent his brother’s hospitalization. Amid the turmoil, Charlotte and Jack share a brief romantic encounter, though she reaffirms her commitment to Van Wetter. Meanwhile, Yardley publishes an exposé co-authored by Ward, securing Van Wetter’s pardon. Post-release, Van Wetter’s true nature—racist, abusive, and manipulative—emerges, contrasting the persona he crafted in letters to Charlotte. He forces her into a traumatic life in the swamps, where she eventually sends Jack a plea for help. The letter is intercepted until Anita discreetly delivers it at W.W.’s wedding, prompting Jack and a recovering Ward to confront Van Wetter. The brothers discover Charlotte murdered, triggering a violent clash. Van Wetter kills Ward by slashing his throat and pursues Jack, who escapes using his swimming skills. Van Wetter is later apprehended, convicted of Ward and Charlotte’s murders, and executed. Anita concludes her account noting Jack’s reunion with his estranged mother at Ward’s funeral and his enduring grief over Charlotte, his unrequited first love. The investigation’s fallout exposes deeper deceptions: Yardley, revealed to be an American fabricating an English identity to advance his career, admits to fabricating the developer’s testimony. Ward’s hidden homosexuality, disclosed by Yardley, further underscores the personal and professional betrayals permeating the case. The tragedy leaves Jack adrift, towing his brother and Charlotte’s bodies home, symbolizing the irreversible consequences of misplaced idealism and fractured relationships.",

Yoon is company president but the reins of power are held by his wife Geum-ok, whose aged father was once a powerful businessman, and whom Yoon married for her money and influence. Yoon's private secretary is Joo Young-jak, from humble origins. His current job is making sure a U.S. businessman, Robert Altman, is kept happy with hookers, as part of a major business deal that could prove crucial to the family's fortunes. When Geum-ok sees Yoon having an affair with their Filipina maid, Eva, on her hidden CCTV, she beds Young-jak in revenge. When Chul is arrested for organizing a slush fund for Altman, Geum-ok decides to further punish her husband for his \"mistake\" in bringing the family's name into public disrepute, by having Eva killed. At the same time, Nami and Young-jak, start an affair. Yoon commits suicide over Eva's death (and takes the blame for his son's activities). After his funeral, Young-jak quits the family, glad to be rid of their influences. He accompanies Eva's coffin to the Philippines, where he is joined on the plane by Nami.",

    "film_title": "Clouds of Sils Maria",
    "Synopsis": "Maria Enders is an international film and stage actress. She travels with a loyal and young American assistant, Valentine. Twenty years earlier, Maria got her big break when she was cast and successfully performed as a young girl Sigrid in both the play and film version of Maloja Snake by Wilhelm Melchior, a Swiss playwright who is now elderly. The play centers on the tempestuous relationship between Sigrid and Helena, a vulnerable older woman as well as her employer. Helena commits suicide after Sigrid takes advantage of her and dumps her. While traveling to Zürich to accept an award on behalf of Wilhelm, and planning to visit him at home the following day at his house in Sils Maria—a remote settlement in the Alps—Maria learns of his death. His widow, Rosa, later confides that Wilhelm had been terminally ill and had ended his life. During the awards ceremony, Maria is approached by Klaus Diesterweg, a popular theater director. He wants to persuade her to appear onstage in a revival of Maloja Snake, but this time in the role of Helena. Maria is torn and reluctantly accepts. To prepare for the role, she accepts Rosa's offer to stay at the Melchiors' house in Sils Maria. Rosa is leaving to escape her memories of Wilhelm. Maria's discussions with Valentine and their read-throughs of the play's scenes evoke uncertainty about the nature of their relationship. A young American actress, 19-year-old Jo-Ann Ellis, has been chosen to portray the role of Sigrid. Researching her on Google and the Internet, Valentine tells Maria, who is out of touch with social media, that Ellis has been involved in numerous scandals. Questions soon multiply regarding aging, time, culture, and the blurring line between the Sigrid/Helena and the Valentine/Maria relationships. Maria and Jo-Ann finally meet, but their relationship is complicated. Jo-Ann appears to be implicated in the attempted suicide of the wife of her new boyfriend. During their time at Sils Maria, Maria and Valentine spend much of their days hiking in the Alps. On one such final outing, they hike to the Maloja Pass to observe the Maloja Snake (both the \"Maloja Snake\" of the play's title and the \"Clouds of Sils Maria\" in the film's title). When discussing the play’s ending, in which Helena walks into the mountains never to return, Valentine suggests that Helena can still be alive and walk away to start a new life. Maria protests that Helena must be dead because she doesn’t return. After suggesting that their approaches to the play are too different for her (Valentine) to be a useful assistant, Valentine disappears without explanation. A few weeks later, a young filmmaker who previously sent a script to Maria visits her by appointment five minutes before the curtain rises on the opening night of Maloja Snake in London. Maria seems preoccupied, being so close to the start of the performance, and dismisses his suggested ideas about the proposed film role he is offering her as \"too abstract for me\". When she says the role he has written is too young for her and would suit Jo-Ann better, he suggests that the character is ageless and he does not relate to his era with its Internet scandals and trashy values. Maria does not give him a reply as to whether she will take part in the film. She next appears onstage, smoking, and waiting for Sigrid.",

    "film_title": "Foxcatcher",
    "Synopsis": "In 1987 Olympic wrestling champion Mark Schultz speaks at an elementary school in place of his older brother Dave. Both won gold medals at the 1984 Summer Olympics, but Mark feels overshadowed by Dave. Mark is contacted by philanthropist and wrestling enthusiast John E. du Pont, an heir to the du Pont family fortune, who arranges to fly Mark to his estate in Pennsylvania where du Pont has built a private wrestling training facility. Du Pont invites Mark to join his wrestling team, Foxcatcher, to be paid to train for the World Championship. Mark accepts the offer, with du Pont urging him to enlist Dave as well. Dave declines, to avoid uprooting his wife and two children, so Mark moves to Pennsylvania alone. Mark stays in a homey guest house and is greeted there by du Pont. Through training with his new teammates and du Pont's financial support, Mark excels with Foxcatcher, winning gold at the 1987 World Wrestling Championships. Du Pont praises him, and they develop a friendship. Du Pont introduces Mark to cocaine, which he starts to use regularly. He confides in Mark, whom he now calls a true friend, telling him how his mother Jean du Pont paid a boy to act as his friend. John organizes an over-50 masters wrestling tournament, which he wins after his opponent is paid to lose the final. Jean tells her son that wrestling is a \"low sport\" and that she does not like seeing him \"being low\". One day Mark and his teammates take the morning off from training to watch mixed martial arts on television. Angered by this (as well as Mark's bitter refusal to be in his brother's presence in Foxcatcher), John slaps Mark and berates him, saying that he will enlist Dave by any means necessary while also demanding that Mark work out his differences with his brother as soon as possible. Dave decides to move with his family to Pennsylvania so he can join Foxcatcher. His self-esteem damaged by du Pont, Mark decides to work and train alone, pushing away both John and Dave. As Foxcatcher prepares to enter the preliminaries for the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, John's mother is escorted into his gym to watch him coach his team. He awkwardly demonstrates basic maneuvers for her and the other wrestlers. Jean leaves in disgust after seeing him give his back to his student. At the 1988 Olympic Trials in Pensacola, Florida, Mark performs poorly, losing his first match against Rico Chiapparelli. Enraged, Mark destroys his room and goes on an eating binge, before Dave manages to break into his room, shocked to discover Mark's condition. They work feverishly so Mark can make his weight class. As Mark trains, John arrives and attempts to speak with him, but Dave turns him away. Mark competes well enough to win his match and make the Olympic team. Dave notices that du Pont is absent, who left for Pennsylvania as his mother died. After returning to the estate, Mark tells Dave that he needs to leave Foxcatcher to get away from John, having accepted a coaching role at Brigham Young University, and unsuccessfully asks Dave to leave with him. For a documentary funded by John about his exploits with Foxcatcher, Dave reluctantly praises him as coach and mentor. Mark loses his matches in Seoul on purpose, after which he leaves Foxcatcher. While Dave continues to live on John's estate and train with Foxcatcher, as a condition for his remaining, he gets du Pont to continue to support Mark financially. Later, John is sitting alone in his mansion's trophy room watching the documentary about Foxcatcher, which ends with Mark complimenting him at a ceremony depicted earlier. John calls his bodyguard and drives to Dave's home, where he finds him in the driveway working on his car radio. As Dave approaches John's car to greet him, John threatens him at gunpoint before shooting him three times and driving away. Dave's wife Nancy rushes out to him, and he dies in her arms. Setting a trap for John at his home, the police ambush and arrest him. The film ends with Mark competing in a cage fighting match with the crowd's cheers ringing in his head.",

    "film_title": "Goodbye to Language",
    "Synopsis": "Goodbye to Language is an experimental narrative that tells two similar versions of a couple having an affair. These two stories are named \"1 Nature\" and \"2 Metaphor\", and they respectively focus on the couples Josette and Gédéon and Ivitch and Marcus, along with a dog. The film begins with \"1 Nature\" at the Nyon cultural center. A young couple, Marie and her boyfriend, are setting up a used bookstand. Another couple, Davidson and Isabelle, arrive. From the way that Marie, her boyfriend, and later the character Ivitch address Davidson, it appears that he is a professor. Brandishing a copy of The Gulag Archipelago, Davidson remarks that its author, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, did not need to use Google to search for the book's subtitle. The professor then asks Isabelle what thumbs used to be for before smartphones, making a punning reference to the French children's story Hop-o'-My-Thumb. He proceeds to deliver an impromptu lecture on the ideas of Jacques Ellul, such as the abdication of individual rights and responsibilities to the state, a situation that Ellul declared to be the triumph of Adolf Hitler. Abruptly a car drives up, a man gets out and, speaking in German, accosts Josette, who has been standing nearby. After demanding that she come home (implying that the man is Josette's husband), threatening her with consequences, and trying to drag her away, the man retreats out of frame and fires shots from a gun. As the other characters rush to where the shots were fired, the car departs. Josette wanders away, while Gédéon, who has been watching all along, follows her. As Josette washes her hands in a fountain, Gédéon approaches and declares to her, \"I am at your service.\" The film switches to \"2 Metaphor\". At the Nyon lakefront, Davidson is sitting on a bench looking through a book of Nicolas de Staël reproductions when Marie and her boyfriend arrive to say goodbye before they go to the United States. Ivitch arrives, dressed like Davidson in matching trench coat and hat. While the two discuss the tyranny of images, the German-speaking man arrives and the scene plays out as before: he accosts Ivitch, fires his gun, and leaves. As before, a man approaches the shaken woman. This time it is the man that is offscreen and the woman who is onscreen (Ivitch behind metal bars, an image used in promotion of the film). The man, Marcus, puts his hand on the bars and declares, \"I am at your service.\" The film returns to \"1 Nature.\" Gédéon and Josette are having an affair and staying in a house together in the summer; they discuss literature and domestic issues. Gédéon references Rodin's The Thinker while sitting on a toilet and declares that people are made equal through the act of defecating. At some point, the scene shifts to Nyon, where Marie examines an unidentified man's body. Returning to Gédéon and Josette's affair, the dog Roxy frolics in the countryside as a narrator talks about humans' relationship with dogs. He wanders into a car with Gédéon and Josette, who bring him home and continue talking with Roxy present. Josette mentions a knife that Gédéon gave her four years earlier. Gédéon and Josette leave to board a ferry, leaving Roxy behind. The film returns to \"2 Metaphor.\" Marcus and Ivitch have an affair in the same house in the winter; they talk about painting and political issues, such as Mao Zedong's opinion of the French Revolution and how Russians will never be Europeans. They have an argument while showering together, followed by shot of a bloody knife in a sink. As their relationship deteriorates, Ivitch reminds Marcus that he told her \"I am at your service.\" Marcus says they should have children. Ivitch says that they should get a dog instead. In an epilogue, \"3 Memory/historical misfortune\", Roxy is again in the countryside while a voiceover narration representing Roxy's thoughts (and paraphrasing Clifford D. Simak's Time and Again) wonders what the water is trying to tell him. A narrator mentions that Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein near the couple's house in Cologny; Shelley is seen in the country writing her book with quill and ink and is joined by Lord Byron and Percy Shelley. An unseen man and woman (Godard and Florence Colombani) paint with watercolors and black ink. They order Roxy out of the room and (paraphrasing Dostoyevsky's Demons) compare Kirillov's two questions, \"a big one and a little one\" (the other world and suffering) and the \"difficult[y of] fit[ting] flatness into depth\" to the act of creating art. Roxy falls asleep on a couch as a narrator (Anne-Marie Miéville) describes his thoughts and the film ends with the sounds of a dog barking and a baby crying. Like many of Godard's films, Goodbye to Language contains numerous references to other works of art or science intertwined within the narrative. It includes clips from such films as Boris Barnet's By the Bluest of Seas, Rouben Mamoulian's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Jean-Pierre Melville's Les Enfants terribles, Artur Aristakisyan's Ladoni, Fritz Lang's Metropolis, Howard Hawks's Only Angels Have Wings, Robert Siodmak's People on Sunday, Alexandre Aja's Piranha 3D and Henry King's The Snows of Kilimanjaro. It verbally quotes Jean Cocteau's Testament of Orpheus without showing any clips and uses archival footage from political events of the 20th century, such as Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The film references or quotes several writers of literature, science, philosophy and political theory. These include both direct quotes (often paraphrased by characters or unseen narrators) and copies of books seen in shots. The references include Alain's Feelings, Passions and Signs, Jean Anouilh's Antigone, Guillaume Apollinaire's Alcools, Louis Aragon's Elsa, je t'aime, Alain Badiou's The Rebirth of History, Samuel Beckett's The Image, Joceyln Benoist's Concepts: Introduction to Analysis, Maurice Blanchot's Awaiting Oblivion, Jorge Luis Borges' The Book of Sand, Louis-Ferdinand Céline's The Church and Letter to Elie Faure, Jacques Chardonne's Eva or the Interrupted Journal, Pierre Clastres' Society Against the State, Jean-Paul Curnier's A World at War, Charles Darwin's The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, Jacques Derrida's The Animal That Therefore I Am, Françoise Dolto's The Gospel at the Risk of Psychoanalysis, Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Demons, Jacques Ellul's The Victory of Hitler?, Gustave Flaubert's Sentimental Education, Hadrien France-Lanord's Heidegger: Thought Irreducible to its Errors, Didier Franck's Nietzsche and the Shadow of God, Sigmund Freud's Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis, Julien Green's Journal, Victor Hugo's Expiation, Emmanuel Levinas's Totality and Infinity, Cesar Pavese's The House on the Hill, Ezra Pound's Works and Usury: Three Essays, Marcel Proust's Jean Santeuil and La Prisonnière, Rainer Maria Rilke's Duino Elegies, George Sand's Elle et Lui and Lettres à Alfred de Musset, Louis Antoine de Saint-Just's Rapport à la convention, March 3, 1794, Jean-Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness, The Age of Reason, Nausea and The Traitor, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Percy Bysshe Shelley's Peter Bell the Third, Clifford D.

Naipaul's A Bend in the River, Mao Zedong (or Zhou Enlai's) famous \"too early to tell\" quote, Plato's proverb \"beauty is the splendour of the truth\" and works by Bernhard Riemann, Jack London and Luc Ferry. It also includes references to Claude Monet and Auguste Rodin's The Thinker Godard even quotes himself: \"Showing a forest, easy. But showing a room with a forest nearby, difficult\" is paraphrased from Godard's 1958 review of Alexandre Astruc's film Une Vie. Some of the references are false, such as a Marcel Proust quote erroneously attributed to Claude Monet and a quote by William Faulkner that is not traceable in his known works. Music in the film includes Alfredo Bandelli's folk song The Witch Hunt, sung by Pino Masi. There are also brief fragments of Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No. 7, Second Movement, Giya Kancheli's Abii Ne Viderem, Dobrinka Tabakova's Suite in Old Style, Part II, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Slavic March, Arnold Schoenberg's Transfigured Night, Jean Sibelius's Symphony No. 2 and Valse triste and Valentyn Sylvestrov's Holy God.",

A new government is in power ten years after the end of the Irish Civil War, an act which leads to Jimmy reestablishing a community centre for young people to dance, study or talk, drawing on his experience with jazz music during his time in the US. The hall becomes popular, which arouses opposition in the town, particularly the Church in the form of Father Sheridan, who denounces the music and dancing at the hall as lewd and licentious. Jimmy and his mother, with whom he is living and who is also sympathetic to Communism, attempt to prevent an eviction of a family who are displaced from their home. Jimmy's activism brings him to the attention of the Gardaí. This starts a chain of events which ends in Jimmy's deportation from Ireland for sedition. As he holds an American passport, he is exiled back to States. During a rally protesting his expulsion, Jimmy's mother decries the lack of a fair trial. Gralton was the first and only Irish person in history to ever be deported from Ireland.",

    "Synopsis": "thumbnail|House of Kolya ( ) In the northern Russian coastal town of Pribrezhny live Nikolay Sergeyev, a hotheaded car mechanic; his second wife, Lilya; and his teenage son, Romka. The town's corrupt Mayor Vadim Sergeyevich is plotting legal chicanery to expropriate the beautiful seaside land on which Nikolay's house is built. The town is forcefully compensating Nikolay with a grossly undervalued sum of 649,000 roubles, and Nikolay believes the Mayor wants the land to build a villa for himself. Nikolay's old friend Dmitry Seleznyov, a sharp and successful lawyer from Moscow, arrives in town to fight the expropriation through the local court system. After the court rules in favor of the expropriation, Nikolay is arrested at the police station for shouting at the officers, and no one in government will accept Dmitry's new criminal filing against the mayor. However, Dmitry meets with the mayor, extorting him with a thick folder of evidence that incriminates him for past crimes. A shocked mayor agrees to release Nikolay and pay 3.5 million roubles. In a local hotel room, Dmitry and Lilya have an affair. The next day, the Sergeyevs and Dmitry attend the seaside birthday cookout of Nikolay's friend Ivan Stepanich, where a child runs to the group saying that he just saw Dmitry choking Lilya. Nikolay runs to find them and gunshots are heard. Afterward, Dmitry and Lilya drive back silently together, both with facial bruises. Meanwhile, Mayor Vadim Sergeyevich goes for help to one of his crony bosses, the Russian Orthodox Church bishop, who tells him that all power comes from God and encourages him to stop whining to him and solve his problems forcefully. When Dmitry meets with the mayor to finalize the payment, the mayor's thugs beat Dmitry, and the mayor carries out a mock execution, advising him to return to Moscow. A conciliatory Lilya returns home to Nikolay but is depressed. Dmitry stands sadly looking out the window of a moving train. While the family is packing to move out, Nikolay forces himself on Lilya, and Romka accidentally glimpses them in intercourse and flees the house, collapsing in tears by a whale skeleton on the shore. He returns home late, screaming that Lilya leave forever. That night Lilya is unable to sleep, and instead of going to work in the morning, she goes alone to the ocean cliff. When she turns up missing, Nikolay desperately searches for her and increases his already very heavy consumption of vodka. Her body is discovered a few days later on the shore. A mournful, drunk Nikolay asks the local Orthodox priest Father Vasily why God is doing this to him. Vasily quotes from the Biblical book of Job and counsels Nikolay that when Job accepted his fate, he was rewarded with a long and happy life. The next morning, Nikolay is arrested for murder. The investigator claims to have evidence that Nikolay had sex with Lilya, killed her with his hammer, and threw her into the sea to hide it. Evidence includes his and Lilya's own friends' testimonies about threats he made to Lilya and Dmitry when he discovered them having sex at the picnic. Nikolay is convicted and sentenced to fifteen years. With no family left, Romka reluctantly agrees to be taken in by Kolya's former friends Polivanovs, to avoid being sent to an orphanage. The Mayor receives a call informing him of Nikolay's sentence, and then gloats that he will now know to keep in his place. Sergeyev's house is torn down. The bishop gives a sermon extolling the virtues of God's truth versus the world's truth and says that good intentions do not excuse evil acts. He urges the congregation, with the mayor attending, not to act with force or cunning but to put their trust in Christ. As the mayor and other local leaders exit the church and drive away in their luxury European and Japanese cars, it is revealed to be Nikolay's old property.",

    "Synopsis": "Agatha Weiss arrives in Los Angeles from Florida and hires limousine driver Jerome to take her to the site of the former house of her brother Benjie. Agatha has severe burns to her face and body, requiring her to take a copious amount of medication, and is estranged from her parents, Stafford and Cristina Weiss. Benjie, a child star and recovering drug addict, visits a girl suffering from non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the hospital. The girl later dies, and Benjie is confronted by her ghost. Stafford is a TV psychologist treating aging actress Havana Segrand for trauma from the psychological and sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of her deceased mother, legendary Hollywood star Clarice Taggart. Havana's agent Genie struggles to secure Havana a role in a remake of her mother's film Stolen Waters. Havana regularly suffers from vivid hallucinations of her mother, who taunts and verbally abuses her. At the suggestion of her friend Carrie Fisher, Havana hires Agatha, whom Carrie had met on Twitter, as a personal assistant. Agatha continues to see Jerome, and a romance forms. Stafford is distressed to learn from Havana that Agatha has returned to Los Angeles. Genie informs Havana that another actress was cast in Stolen Waters, but when the actress's young son unexpectedly dies in an accident, Havana secures the part. Using Havana's role to gain access to the studio lot, Agatha visits Benjie on the set of Bad Babysitter 2, the comedy he is filming as his comeback following drug rehabilitation. Agatha tells him that she has returned from a sanatorium to make amends for setting the fire that burned her and nearly killed him when he was seven. Appalled to learn Agatha visited Benjie, Stafford finds her in her hotel room, gives her $10,000 and tells her to leave Los Angeles. Benjie relapses, getting high on GHB and shooting his friend Rhett's dog. On set, he is haunted by the girl from the hospital and strangles his young co-star nearly to death during one of his hallucinations. The child survives, but Benjie loses his role in the film and is committed to a hospital. Agatha visits Cristina and reveals that before she set the fire she had discovered that her parents were brother and sister, making Agatha and Benjie children of incest. Cristina tells her they were separated as children and met by coincidence, starting a relationship before they knew of their relation. Stafford comes home, and when Agatha tells him she knows about their incest, he violently beats her until Cristina intervenes. During the altercation, Agatha steals Cristina's wedding ring. Havana requests Jerome as a driver and seduces him in the backseat of his parked limo in the driveway of her home as Agatha watches from the window. Havana enters the house and berates Agatha for her poor performance at work. When Havana verbally humiliates Agatha for staining her couch with menstrual blood, Agatha beats Havana to death with one of her awards. Benjie escapes the hospital and comes to Havana's house to find Agatha. Agatha instructs Benjie to retrieve her father's ring. Stafford returns home to see Cristina on fire outside beside the pool; he pushes her into the pool with a piece of furniture to save her, but she dies. Stafford goes into a catatonic state and does not resist when Benjie removes the ring from his finger. The siblings use their parents' rings in a wedding ritual they used to perform as children, then commit suicide using Agatha's medication. Throughout the film, liberal quotations from Paul Éluard's poem \"Liberté\" meander \"through each of the characters' lives,\" creating an underlying mantra for the film.",

    "Synopsis": "In a fictional outcome for the 2015 Canadian federal election, a political party comes to power and establishes a law called S-14. This legislation allows parents of troubled children with limited finances to place their children in hospitals, without regard for fundamental justice. Diane \"Die\" Després, a widowed mother and 46-year-old advice columnist, picks up her son Steve from an institution. Steve, who has ADHD and an attachment disorder, was being discharged after starting a fire in which another youth was injured. Die brings Steve to their new home in Saint-Hubert and struggles to care for him under financial distress. When Steve gives her a cart full of groceries and a necklace reading \"Mommy\", Die suspects that he has stolen the items. Enraged by the accusation, Steve begins choking her, and she defends herself by hitting him with a glass frame. Whilst chaos ensues, Kyla, a neighbour and teacher on sabbatical, shows up to tend to Steve's wounds. Kyla, who is dealing with a stuttering problem and recently moved into the area with her husband and daughter, begins to tutor Steve. After a disastrous tutoring session where Steve goads Kyla, she snaps and attacks him. After the confrontation, Steve mellows and indicates he is glad to know her and respects her boundaries and expectations. Kyla notes Steve reminds her of her late son. The three have bonded and their situation improves: Die has a cleaning job and translation work on the side, Kyla's speech problem is resolving, and Steve is receiving better marks on his school work. All is looking up, until Die is served papers by the parents of the injured boy, indicating she and Steve are being sued for the injuries caused by his fire. Die finds a lawyer, a neighbour and a potential love interest, who is willing to help them with Steve's case. The three of them go out to a karaoke restaurant for the evening. Over the night, Steve is increasingly agitated by the atmosphere and what he sees as his mother's sexual interest in the lawyer. Steve decides to sing, but is taunted by the audience, leading to a fight. They are thrown out. Steve, Die and their lawyer argue, ending with Die slapping the lawyer in retaliation for him slapping Steve, driving the lawyer away. Die in turn shouts at Steve for continually being an issue in her life, whereupon Steve runs away. He returns the following morning. Die continues to try and help her son and rebuild their lives, but while out shopping with Steve and Kyla, Steve disappears. He is found by Kyla after slitting his wrists. Although he survives, Die comes to realise she is running out of options. One day Die and Kyla surprise Steve with a picnic, and on the drive Die finds herself reflecting on all the dreams she had for her son to live a fulfilled, happy life. The trio end up not at a picnic site as the faux ending implies, but at a hospital to commit Steve under S-14. Upon realising the deception by the two women, Steve angrily resists attempts to apprehend him by hospital staff. Die begins to regret the decision when she helplessly watches the officials use violence and tasers to subdue him. Kyla announces she is moving to Toronto and Die encourages her. Kyla is relieved Die is not upset. While explaining how much she enjoyed her time with Die and Steve, she accidentally makes a faux-pas about 'abandoning her family'. Die responds that she holds on to hope that her life and the life she envisages for her son will come to fruition. Kyla returns home as Die privately breaks down in tears. While preparing dinner and doing translation work, Die misses a phone call from Steve. Back at the hospital, Steve, restrained in a straitjacket, apologises to his mother in a voicemail. Immediately after the straps of his jacket are removed by two officials, Steve runs full speed towards a large, bright window.",

    "Synopsis": "Profoundly affected by the death of his father, loved by his housekeeper, Hannah Danby, whom he takes for granted and occasionally uses sexually, painter J. M. W. Turner forms a close and loving relationship with a seaside landlady, Mrs. Booth, with whom he eventually lives incognito in Chelsea. Turner travels, paints, stays with the country aristocracy, visits a brothel, is a popular if anarchic member of the Royal Academy of Arts, has himself strapped to the mast of a ship so that he can paint a snowstorm, and is both celebrated and reviled by the public and by royalty. The story recreates the memorable occasion during the Royal Academy Exhibition of 1832 when Turner's seascape Helvoetsluys was placed next to Constable's The Opening of Waterloo Bridge seen from Whitehall. Seeing how the muted tones of his own painting paled next to Constable's vibrant work, in a quick stroke Turner adds a smear of red paint representing a buoy. Recognising Turner's genius, Constable says, \"He's been here and fired a gun.\"",

    "film_title": "Saint Laurent (film)",
    "Synopsis": "The film tells the story of fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent at the peak of his career between 1967 and 1976. The film starts with Saint Laurent alone and depressed in a hotel room apparently after a night of partying in Paris nightclubs. He is placing a call to a newspaper journalist to grant a tell-all interview which he had previously declined. In the mid-1960s, Saint Laurent emerges as a leading voice in French fashion. His business begins to flourish and grow internationally. Less well known about his private life is his love of the Paris nightlife, and the clubs and homes of the rich and avant-garde. Saint Laurent enjoys the nightlife and the endless hours of champagne, pot, and drugs which seem to surround him at every turn. During one evening, he sees an attractive model, Betty Catroux, at a nightclub and approaches her about becoming a model for his fashion house. She turns him down saying that she is under contract with Chanel. Saint Laurent is persistent and keeps repeating his requests, while continuing to flatter her good looks. As the evening progresses, the two begin dancing together on the discotheque floor, and then start to mingle having drinks together. Later that week, Betty is seen in Saint Laurent's studio modeling his new designs for him while he creates his new fashions, and Saint Laurent celebrates having recruited one of Chanel's top model for his own fashion house. Saint Laurent's success continues and he forms a long-term same-sex relationship with his business manager, Pierre Bergé, which is profitable to both men financially and in their personal emotional lives. Saint Laurent's use of alcohol and drugs seems to continue and to grow along with his international success as a fashion designer. On one night out of partying, a young male operative named Jacques de Bascher spies out Saint Laurent and approaches him with plainly presented romantic and sexual intentions. Saint Laurent is captivated by his good looks and the two begin an intensely explicit affair. Their preferred mutual habits of enjoying the Paris nightlife and drug use seem to spiral them out of control into a tumultuous relationship. Saint Laurent's long-term affair with Pierre at this fashion house in put on hold as Saint Laurent continues his new romantic affair with Jacques. When Saint Laurent wakes up one morning in his hotel room, seemingly alone and dejected, he calls the newspaper journalist whom he had previously declined to interview with, and now present his own sensational tell-all version of his sexual proclivities and his penchant for the Paris nightlife. When his office and Pierre later learn that the newspaper is planning to proceed with the tell-all interview, they react harshly and threaten legal action for defamation and libel against the newspaper if they go ahead with publication. They state that the telephone interview was a prank by someone unknown to Saint Laurent and that printing the interview would only cause the newspaper embarrassment to their own reputation as journalists, as well as years in court defending themselves against a costly lawsuit for libel. The film moves forward in time, showing Saint Laurent in old age living in his opulent Paris apartments surrounded by fine art and expensive fetishist possessions in his collection of exotic leopard skins and other wildlife shown on display throughout his flat. Saint Laurent dies in old age having become one of the most accomplished Paris fashion designers of the 20th century.",

    "Synopsis": "In Niagara Falls, Ontario, homicide detective Jeffrey Cornwall interviews for a job with Nicole Dunlop in the Internet Child Exploitation Unit. He recoils in disgust after seeing the images related to an open case, but Nicole advises him these are the types of images he will have to see every day and not look away from. Meanwhile, local contractor Matthew Lane picks up his 9-year-old daughter, Cassandra, after her figure skating practice. Matthew stops to pick up pie, leaving Cassandra in his truck. Minutes later, he returns to find her missing. He reports the abduction to the police station, where Jeffrey and Nicole are assigned to the case. They are skeptical of his story, which infuriates him. Cassandra's mother, Tina Lane, arrives and breaks down in rage at Matthew. Eight years later, Matthew and Tina are estranged; she blames him for Cassandra's disappearance. Nicole and Jeffrey are now romantically involved. Tina meets with the police regularly to discuss their case but Matthew, originally a suspect, has become a vigilante in the search for Cassandra. This entire time Cassandra has been held captive in the home of a child pornographer named Mika, who has installed remote cameras in the hotel rooms where Tina works as a chambermaid. Although Mika leaves his house to work and is no longer sexually interested in the now-adult Cassandra, the fear that he will harm her parents keeps Cassandra from escaping or seeking help. Jeffrey finds recent photos of Cassandra online. Mika makes her tell stories on camera to lure in younger children. Nicole poses as a child, which allows her and Jeffrey to catch a child molester named Willy, as well as a group of others. The arrests put Nicole in the public eye. Mika visits Willy in prison and urges him not to take any deals for cooperation. Willy says he will only comply if someone kidnaps Nicole and forces her to reveal what in her past may have inspired her to pursue child protection. Cassandra begins chatting online with a young girl, trying to entice her to meet. When Nicole arrives home, she finds Jeffrey using his own niece as bait to infiltrate the child porn community and immediately shuts off the webcam. Mika secretly turns the webcam back on to watch their fight and reconsiders Willy's offer regarding Nicole. Nicole attends a dinner held in her honor where she is drugged and kidnapped by Vicky, a woman working for Mika. While transporting trees in his truck, Matthew stays overnight at a motel. He wakes to find the trees have been taken and left in a trail that ultimately leads him to a remote location where he finds Cassandra. Cassandra resists leaving with him and Matthew does not understand why until Mika appears and tranquilizes him; Mika had arranged the meeting to watch their reunion. Mika locks Nicole in a van and tells her to tell her story in a microphone. At the ice skating rink, Vicky questions Cassandra's former skating partner, Albert, about their history, pressuring him for details on how he was impacted by the disappearance. Matthew overhears this and follows Vicky to a restaurant, where he eavesdrops as Vicky plays a recording of her conversation with Albert for Mika. Matthew calls Jeffrey with their location and plants his GPS-enabled phone on Mika's vehicle. Matthew goads the diner staff to call the police by being disruptive. He confronts the abductors to buy more time and steals Vicky's cell phone. She and Mika chase Matthew in their vehicle, shooting at his truck. Matthew escapes by driving by the diner again, where multiple police cars have responded to the staff's earlier calls. Jeffrey tracks Matthew's phone and locates Mika's house. Jeffrey is shot by Vicky, but she is killed by another officer. Jeffrey then fatally wounds Mika, who dies while being interrogated for Nicole's location. The Lane family is reunited at the police station, and then Tina and Cassandra visit Jeffrey as he recovers in the hospital. The police finally find and rescue Nicole. Cassandra skates at her old ice rink and smiles.",

    "film_title": "The Homesman",
    "Synopsis": "In 1854, Mary Bee Cuddy, a 31-year-old unmarried teacher from New York, came to the Midwest for more opportunities. In the small farming community of Loup in the Nebraska Territory she owns sizable property and is financially secure. Though she seems strong and independent, she suffers from depression and feels isolated. She invites her neighbor Bob Giffen for dinner and proposes marriage, but he turns her down, saying she is plain-looking and too bossy. He leaves to find a wife back east. After a harsh winter, three women in the community show signs of prairie madness. Arabella Sours has lost three children to diphtheria, and Gro Svendsen, a Danish immigrant in an abusive marriage, breaks down after her mother dies. Theoline Belknap kills her own child after a poor harvest. Reverend Dowd calls upon one of their husbands to escort the women east to the Lady's Aid Society Methodist Church in Hebron, Iowa, which cares for the mentally ill. Theoline's husband Vester refuses to participate in the lottery to decide who will escort the women; Cuddy takes his place, and the lot falls on her. While preparing for the trip, Cuddy encounters George Briggs, a claim jumper, who has been left on horseback with a noose around his neck for stealing Bob Giffen's land in his absence. Scared to make the trip alone, she frees him, on the condition that he helps escort the women. He immediately casts doubt on the job and insists he be free to abandon her at any time. To persuade him, Cuddy tells him she will mail $300 to await his arrival in Iowa, but she secretly keeps it with her. The group crosses paths with hostile Pawnee. Briggs bribes them by giving up Cuddy's horse. Later, Arabella is kidnapped. Briggs gives chase, and the two men scuffle before Arabella kills her kidnapper. Eventually, the group reaches the grave of an 11-year-old girl which has been desecrated by Indians. Cuddy insists they stop and restore it, but Briggs vows to push on, so Cuddy stays behind, saying she will catch up with them. After restoring the grave, Cuddy sets out on horseback but loses her way. After riding all night she finds herself back at the grave and realizes she has gone in a circle. Finally catching up to Briggs after another night of riding, Cuddy, distraught over having to wander the prairie, suggests they marry. Briggs declines, saying he \"ain't no farmer\". On the same night, Cuddy asks Briggs to sleep with her, which he does reluctantly. The next morning, Briggs finds Cuddy dead, having hanged herself. Briggs chastises Sours, Belknap, and Svendsen, blaming their illness for Cuddy's death as he buries her body. He finds the $300, takes a horse, and abandons the three women. However, the trio follows him on foot, and Arabella almost drowns while chasing him across a river. Briggs saves her and decides to go on to Iowa. They reach an empty hotel. The proprietor, Irishman Aloysius Duffy, says they have no rooms available as a group of 16 investors is expected shortly, and the women would sour the establishment. Briggs lashes out at Duffy, whose men pull out their guns, resulting in a brief stand-off. Briggs leaves, but returns that night alone on horseback. He sends away the young cook, sets the hotel on fire, and shoots Duffy in the foot. Briggs takes a suckling pig to feed himself and the women and leaves all inside the hotel to be burned alive. Briggs reaches Hebron, passing the women into the care of Altha Carter, the reverend's wife. He informs her of Cuddy's death but does not disclose the cause. Feeling guilty about rejecting her marriage proposal, he has a wooden slab engraved with her name, planning to mark her grave with it. He discovers that his $300 is worthless, the Bank of Loup having failed since they left. He gives a pair of shoes to Tabitha Hutchinson, a hard-working young maid at the hotel where he is staying, and then proposes to her, after advising her not to marry some young man going west, but to stay in town. She replies, \"Maybe.\" He then boards the open-decked river ferry heading back west, where he sings a rowdy song with two musicians on deck. Briggs fires his pistol and shouts at people on the pier who complain about the noise. Eventually, one of the bargemen kicks Cuddy's wooden grave marker off the edge of the deck into the river; unnoticed by Briggs, it floats away.",

    "Synopsis": "Gelsomina and her three younger sisters live with their parents on an Italian farm. As the eldest, she takes on a heavier burden, taking care of her sisters and assisting her father, Wolfgang, with beekeeping. One evening, as the family is playing on the beach, they are told to be quieter and discover that a TV show is being filmed nearby. They watch and, as they are about to leave, the star, Milly, calls them over and gives Gelsomina a hair clip. Watching the program on TV, Gelsomina learns that it is launching a competition called Countryside Wonders, in which seven farmers will compete to have their products featured. While her father is strongly against participating, her mother warms to the idea, even though the quality of their honey is not great. Meanwhile, Wolfgang hires a juvenile delinquent named Martin to help with honey production. Martin never talks. Though Wolfgang tries to help Martin, he discovers that he is ineffectual. Unbeknownst to her father, Gelsomina applies on behalf of her family. She forgets about it after her father's old friend comes to stay. Later, left alone by their parents, while switching out the honeycombs to put in the processor, she accidentally injures one of her sisters, Marinella. At the hospital, while Marinella is being stitched up, Gelsomina realizes that Martin forgot to change the bucket which collects the processed honey and, on returning home, they find honey spilled over the floor. At the same time, they are visited by a man from the competition to inspect their production room. The children clean the work area and they are accepted. However, Wolfgang is infuriated by the news. Nevertheless, the family competes on the show, where they are dressed in ridiculous garb and must plead their case to the judges. On TV, Wolfgang freezes and cannot explain what makes his honey so special. However, Gelsomina steps up and, with Martin, performs a trick in which he whistles and bees crawl out of her mouth onto her face. The family loses the competition, however. Martin runs away and Gelsomina follows him but cannot find him. On the last boat ride back from the island, she finds herself alone with Milly, who takes off her wig and gives Gelsomina a hairpin. Gelsomina swims back to the island and finds Martin, but returns to her family without him.",

    "Synopsis": "Armed members of the Ansar Dine group pursue a gazelle across the sandy desert in a jeep. Later, they take aim at intricately carved wooden sculptures in the Bambara style, which include depictions of bare-breasted women. Upon reaching Timbuktu, a city known for its tolerant interpretation of Islam, the jihadists impose strict clothing regulations, critiquing the length of pant legs and mandating burkas, gloves, and stockings for women in public. They swiftly prohibit television, radio, football, alcohol, music, and loitering. Despite armed enforcement, when the foreigners enter a local mosque wearing shoes, the Imam diplomatically rebukes their rules and dismisses them. Beyond Timbuktu, a family resides in a nomad's tent: the father Kidane, mother Satima who eschews veiling, their daughter Toya, and adopted son Issan. They subsist on livestock, owning eight cattle and goats. Their prized cow, GPS, is pregnant, and Kidane plans to gift the calf to Issan. While Issan tends to the cows near the river, he encounters Amadou, a fisherman, who has set his nets. Meanwhile, a water seller transports water from the river to tent-dwelling families on a motorcycle. Meanwhile, the jihadists tighten their grip on the city, shooting propaganda videos, patrolling for music enthusiasts, and discussing football fervently. The youth resort to playing ball-less football, as the jihadists confiscate the ball. One jihadist, chauffeured through the desert, visits Satima in Kidane's absence, offering his number despite her rejection. During a grazing trip, GPS becomes entangled in Amadou's nets. Enraged, Amadou fatally spears the cow. Issan rushes back to the tent in tears, recounting the incident to Kidane. Against Satima's counsel, Kidane confronts Amadou, resulting in a struggle and a fatal shot. Kidane is apprehended by a patrol and jailed. As he faces a murder charge, Kidane implores a guard to inform Satima. She and Toya wait atop a dune for news. Kidane's trial proceeds in Arabic, requiring translation for him. Seeking empathy, he highlights his daughter's plight to the jihadist judge, assuming shared ethnic ties due to language. However, the translator, hailing from Libya like many Tuareg jihadists, remains impassive. Meanwhile, musicians and a singer face arrest and flogging, while a couple is stoned to death for their alleged romance. A girl, found with a cellphone, is forcibly married against her will, disregarding the Imam's plea for intervention. Just before Kidane's execution, the water seller brings Satima to the site. As they rush towards each other, they are fatally shot. As the water seller escapes into the desert, Toya and Issan are left wandering, grief-stricken.",

    "film_title": "Two Days, One Night",
    "Synopsis": "In Seraing, an industrial town near Liège, Belgium, young wife and mother Sandra prepares to return to work at Solwal, a small solar panel factory, after a medical leave of absence for depression. During her absence, Mr. Dumont, the manager of Solwal, realizes her colleagues are able to cover her shifts by working slightly longer hours and asks them to choose between retaining Sandra's position or receiving a €1,000 bonus. On Friday evening, after Sandra hears the news and that only two of her 16 coworkers voted for her to stay, she breaks down, feeling hopeless and worthless. Sandra's husband, Manu, works to lift her spirits and convinces her to talk to Dumont with Juliette, a coworker and friend. Sandra is too petrified to speak, but Juliette argues her case, saying some of the workers felt pressured to vote against Sandra by the factory foreman, Jean-Marc, who insinuated that one employee would be let go regardless of the vote, and Dumont agrees to allow a second, secret ballot on Monday morning. Pushed by Juliette and Manu, Sandra reluctantly agrees to talk to each of the coworkers who voted against her over the course of the weekend and attempt to persuade seven of them to reject the bonus. She faces an uphill battle, as most of her coworkers, several of whom are immigrants, are counting on the bonus for their own families, and she discovers that some work second jobs to get by. Her resolve to continue wavers when she is met with coldness, such as when a coworker she considered a friend pretends not to be home, or anger, such as when her visit prompts an altercation between a son and father, but she is heartened by the few who support her and say they will change their vote, such as Timur, who breaks down in tears and says he is ashamed of himself, as Sandra covered for him when he broke a panel on his first day. Timur even says he will contact another worker on Sandra's behalf. On Sunday afternoon, Sandra discovers that Jean-Marc has been calling her coworkers to convince them not to change their votes, as he is against her coming back because of her depression. She visits Anne, who says she would like to vote for Sandra, but Anne's husband interrupts and throws Sandra out. Dejected, Sandra tells Manu to take her home, where she takes an overdose of Xanax. When Anne arrives to say she will support Sandra, Sandra tells Manu about the pills, and he forces her to vomit them up. At the hospital, Sandra tells Manu that she wants to visit her last three coworkers that evening. Anne tells Sandra that she has decided to leave her husband, and Sandra offers her a place to spend the night. Alphonse, a young African immigrant who is a contract worker at Solwal, tells Sandra that, although he would only get a €150 bonus, Jean-Marc told him to vote against Sandra to fit in with his coworkers. He says he wants to vote for Sandra, but is afraid Jean-Marc will retaliate by giving him a bad review so his contract will not get renewed. On Monday morning, the atmosphere at Solwal is volatile. While the workers vote, Jean-Pierre calls Sandra a troublemaker, but she stands up for herself. There are eight votes for Sandra—one short of a majority. She tearfully thanks those who supported her, including Alphonse, and is clearing out her locker when Dumont calls her to his office. He tells her that he has decided to give everyone the bonus and also keep her on, but Sandra's joy is short-lived, as he explains he will come up with the money by not renewing the contract of a contract worker. Not wanting to retain her job at the expense of someone else, Sandra rejects this offer and leaves. As she walks away from Solwal, she calls Manu to give him the news. After saying she will begin to look for a new job that day, she tells him, \"We put up a good fight. I'm happy.\"",

    "Synopsis": "Wild Tales is composed of six short segments: \"Pasternak\", \"Las ratas\" (\"The Rats\"), \"El más fuerte\" (\"The Strongest\"), \"Bombita\" (\"Little Bomb\"), \"La propuesta\" (\"The Proposal\"), and \"Hasta que la muerte nos separe\" (\"Till Death Do Us Part\"). In the American localisation, the third and fifth sections had their names changed to \"Road to Hell\" and \"The Bill\". Two passengers on an airplane start a conversation and discover they both know a man named Gabriel Pasternak; the woman (María Marull), his ex-girlfriend, had sex with his only friend and the man (Darío Grandinetti), a music critic, savagely reviewed Pasternak's work. In fact, everyone on the flight is connected to Pasternak and in some moment wronged or rejected him. A flight attendant reveals Pasternak is the plane's cabin chief and has locked himself inside the cockpit. Amid the panic, as Pasternak's former psychiatrist tries to reason with him by reminding him that his parents were responsible for his life of misery, Pasternak crashes the airplane into his parents' house. At a highway restaurant on a slow night, a waitress (Julieta Zylberberg) recognizes a loan shark (César Bordón) who had, years before, ruined her family, forced them to move and caused her father's untimely death via suicide. The cook (Rita Cortese), who is a felon, offers to mix rat poison into the man's food. The waitress refuses the offer but unbeknownst to her, the cook adds the poison anyway. When the waitress finds out, she does not take the food away from the man. However, the loan shark's teenage son then arrives and begins to share his father's meal. Worried the boy might eat the poison, the waitress tries to remove the plate; she throws food in the man's face and he attacks her in a chokehold. The cook then backstabs and kills the loan shark with a chef's knife. In the last scene, the loan shark's son is getting medical treatment from a responding ambulance while the waitress sits next to him solemnly. The cook is arrested and is driven away in a police car. Diego (Leonardo Sbaraglia) is driving through a desert and tries to overtake a slower, older car that consistently blocks his path. When he finally passes, he insults the other driver, Mario (Walter Donado). Further up the road, Diego gets a flat tire while Mario catches up. Mario parks his car in front of Diego's, smashes Diego's windshield, and then defecates and urinates on it. When Mario is about to leave, Diego pushes him and his car into the river, and drives off. Fearing retribution, Diego returns to run down Mario but loses control and crashes into the river. Mario enters Diego's car and the men start to fight. Mario leaves Diego to be strangled by a seat belt; he then rips off a piece of his shirt, sets fire to it, and places it in the gas tank to incinerate the car, but Diego prevents him from escaping. As the car explodes, the tow truck driver called by Diego arrives. The police later discover the two men's charred bodies holding onto each other and mistake them for lovers who died in a crime of passion. {{multiple image | direction = horizontal | align = right | image1 = El académico Oscar Martínez (cropped).jpg | width1 = 151 | alt1 = | caption1 = | image2 = Ricardo Darín en la Casa Rosada 2010-03-18.jpg | width2 = 150 | alt2 = | caption2 = | footer = Oscar Martínez (left) – who appears in the fifth segment – and Ricardo Darín (right) – who plays the title character in \"Bombita\" – were given the opportunity to choose the role they wanted for the film because Szifron wanted to work with them. reception, the bride Romina (Érica Rivas) discovers her groom Ariel (Diego Gentile) has been having an affair with one of the guests.

    "Synopsis": "Aydın, a former actor, owns a mountaintop hotel in Cappadocia, as well as several properties which he rents out to local tenants. He leads a more idyllic life than most people around him in the region. Educated and wealthy, he spends his time writing columns for a local newspaper and researching the history of Turkish theater, of which he hopes to write a book someday. One day, Aydın and his assistant Hidayet are driving down to the village when a stone shatters the window. It was thrown by İlyas, the son of İsmail, one of Aydın's tenants who is several months behind in the rent. When Hidayet confronts the father, it turns out that Aydın's people had already sent a collection agency that took İsmail's television and refrigerator, with İsmail getting beaten up by the police for resisting. The situation escalates until İsmail's brother Hamdi intervenes. Hamdi, the eager-to-please local imam, brings the young İlyas to Aydın in an attempt to make amends for the glass-breaking incident. However, this only serves to annoy Aydin, inspiring him to write a column on how an imam should really give a proper example to their community. At first, his sister Necla wonders why Aydın does not use his writing talent in a better place than the local newspaper. Later, she reverses her view and tells him that he is just superficially and sentimentally criticising other people from his comfortable armchair. This results in a long chain of snide remarks made back and forth at each other. This reversal occurs after Necla mentions to Aydın's wife Nihal that Necla might be better off going back to her ex-husband, after which Nihal tells Necla that she is free to leave even though it is a stupid idea. Nihal is much younger than her husband Aydın. She tries to give meaning to her life by fundraising for developing schools, an activity for which Aydın has not shown much interest. However, when Nihal organizes a fundraiser event in their home, Aydın becomes annoyed and tells her that the fundraiser event will be a guaranteed failure due to her lack of experience and bookkeeping skills. This turns into an emotional argument, where he tells her that she is free to divorce from him if she wishes so. Finally, Aydın states that he will leave for Istanbul for several months to make arrangements for his book. He warns her that she should not trust Levent (Nadir Sarıbacak), one of the other people involved in the fundraiser, since Aydın considers Levent to lack moral values. Before he leaves, Aydın makes a large anonymous donation in cash. The next day, Hidayet takes Aydın to the train station, carrying all the luggage while Aydın comfortably walks empty-handed. Due to heavy snow fall, the train is severely delayed, and Aydın decides that they will visit Aydın's friend Suavi in a nearby village. Suavi welcomes Aydın's visit, but Levent also shows up, as Levent and Suavi had agreed earlier to go out hunting. They spend the evening drinking and talking. There is some tension between Aydın and Levent, as Levent makes insinuations that Aydın did not do enough to help in the aftermath of an earthquake, six years earlier. In the meantime, Nihal visits the house of Hamdi, İsmail, İlyas, and the sick grandmother. Nihal learns that İsmail was unemployed after a prison sentence for stabbing a lingerie thief and that İlyas had been suffering from pneumonia. Their financial difficulties are due to the fact that Hamdi has to take care of all of them from his modest income as an imam. Nihal offers the money that Aydın had donated, around 10,000 lira ($5,900 in 2013), enough to buy a house in the area. İsmail is insulted by what he sees as an attempt to pay off her conscience and burns the money in the fireplace, to the horror of Nihal. Aydın returns home the next day. As Nihal stares out of the window, silently, Aydin's voice is heard explaining to Nihal that even if she doesn't love him anymore, she can't live without him and Aydın asks for her forgiveness. Aydin starts his procrastinated project of writing about the history of Turkish theatre as heavy snow falls to Cappadocia.",

See: WP:CAREFUL--> During the Christmas season of 1952, aspiring photographer Therese Belivet is working in Frankenberg's department store in Manhattan. She meets a glamorous woman, Carol Aird, who is searching for a doll for her daughter, Rindy. At Therese's recommendation, Carol purchases a model train set instead. When Carol departs, she leaves her gloves on the counter. Therese mails them to her using Frankenberg's sales slip with Carol's name and address. Therese's boyfriend, Richard, wants her to go to France with him, hoping they will marry, but she is ambivalent about their relationship. A mutual friend, Dannie, invites Therese to his workplace, The New York Times, and offers to introduce her to a photo editor friend. Meanwhile, Carol is going through a difficult divorce from her husband, Harge. Carol calls Frankenberg's to thank the clerk who returned the gloves and invites Therese to lunch. Therese visits Dannie and he kisses her, but she becomes uncomfortable and leaves. Carol invites Therese to her home in New Jersey. She stops to purchase a Christmas tree, and Therese takes candid photographs of her. Harge arrives unexpectedly to take Rindy to Florida for Christmas; he becomes suspicious of Therese, as Carol had an affair years before with her friend Abby. Therese witnesses their argument. After Rindy leaves, a distressed Carol takes Therese to the train station so she can return home. Carol calls to apologize to Therese and they meet at her apartment, where Carol surprises her with a suitcase containing a gift of a Canon camera and film. Carol has learned that Harge is petitioning the judge to consider a \"morality clause\" against her, threatening to expose her homosexuality and give him full custody of Rindy. She decides to take a road trip to escape the stress of the divorce proceedings and invites Therese to join her. Richard accuses Therese of being infatuated with Carol and predicts Carol will soon tire of her. The two argue and their relationship comes to an end. On the second night of the trip, Therese meets a traveling salesman, Tommy Tucker. On New Year's Eve, Carol and Therese kiss for the first time and have sex. The next morning, they discover that Tucker is actually a private investigator Harge hired to obtain evidence against Carol. Carol confronts Tucker, threatening him at gunpoint, but he claims to have already sent tape recordings to Harge. Carol and Therese turn back. The next day, in Chicago, Therese learns that Carol has flown home to fight for custody of her daughter, having asked Abby to drive Therese home. Abby gives her a letter from Carol. Back at home, Therese telephones Carol, but knowing that she risks losing custody of Rindy if she continues her relationship with Therese, Carol hangs up. Therese creates a portfolio of her photographs and gets a job at The New York Times. In the meantime, Carol has been seeing a psychotherapist as a condition of the divorce settlement. During a confrontational meeting in mid-April with divorce lawyers, Carol suddenly admits to the truth of what the tapes contain and refuses to deny her sexuality. To avoid going to court and the likelihood of a public scandal, she tells Harge that he can have custody of Rindy if he allows her regular visits. Carol writes to Therese, and they meet in the lounge of the Ritz Tower Hotel. Carol reveals she is going to work for a furniture house and has taken an apartment on Madison Avenue. Therese declines Carol's invitation to live with her. Carol tells Therese that she is meeting associates in the Oak Room, and that if she changes her mind, they can have dinner. Therese remains still and Carol says, \"I love you.\" They are interrupted by Jack, a colleague who has not seen Therese in months, and Carol departs. Therese accepts Jack's ride to a party, but finds she cannot connect with anyone. She leaves for the Oak Room. She scans the diners and sees Carol at a table. Therese hesitates, then walks toward Carol. Their eyes meet. Carol gazes at Therese with a smile that slowly grows.",

He is later seen looking at photos of Nadia Wilson on Facebook, the same person he was following. We find that David is a nurse. His first patient is Sarah, who is dying of AIDS. He tenderly bathes and dresses her, and manages her daily activities; for example, sends her visiting family away when she needs rest and helping prepare meals for her. He arrives at work one day to learn Sarah has died. He enters the bedroom where she has died, and cleans and dresses her one last time. He attends her funeral, where her niece asks him if he is free to discuss her aunt, but he declines. He is later in a bar where he gets into conversation with a recently engaged young girl. He tells her that he was married for 21 years, that his wife was called Sarah and that she died of AIDS. David is reassigned to an elderly stroke victim, an architect named John. John comes to like David, who lets John watch pornographic movies on his laptop. David purchases books on architecture in a bookstore, telling the bookstore assistant that he is an architect, and presents John with a picture of a house (which John had designed) as a birthday gift. David's boss, Robert, subsequently calls David into the agency, where he is fired as John's family is suing the agency for sexual harassment, due to John watching the pornographic movie and John having an erection whilst bathing. David denies the charges but admits to working extra shifts because he was attached to John. He tries to make one last visit but John’s daughter sends him away. It is revealed that David had a young son who died with a terminal illness, and that the young girl that he was stalking (Nadia) is actually his daughter, who is studying medicine in college. David meets up with his daughter as well as his ex-wife, who has remarried but since divorced after four years. David's friend (and former boss) Isaac gets him a job with Martha, who has cancer and needs support for chemotherapy appointments. She tells him she knows about the sexual harassment suit but hires him regardless. Martha’s cancer spreads and David helps her when she becomes sick. Martha lies to her daughter, telling her that her cancer is in remission. Martha then asks David if he will help her die; he refuses and she fires him. He subsequently comes to her house and injects her, leading to her death. He calls Isaac and reports Martha died of cardiac arrest. David's next patient is Greg, a 16-year-old boy who uses a wheelchair. David is hired for one week, as Greg's regular caregiver is away. David briefly discusses Greg with Nadia. David is seen taking Greg to the park, where Greg swears at David. Later David goes for an outdoor run (he has been seen jogging both in the gym and outside during the movie) and whilst doing so is struck dead by a car. He appears to have glanced at the oncoming traffic before the accident.",

There he decides to move to France to take a fresh chance at life. However, in order to secure political asylum, he requires a convincing cover story. He is given the passport of a dead man, Dheepan Natarajan, and pairs with people he barely knows, posing as his family. Along with his supposed wife, Yalini, and his supposed 9-year-old daughter, Illayaal, they get on a ship bound for Paris. Upon arrival, he lands a job as a resident caretaker and starts building a new life in a banlieue housing project named Le Pré. He winds up as a caretaker of a rough housing project controlled by drug dealers (filmed on location in the peaceful project of La Coudraie, in the suburban city of Poissy). The new home turns out to be another conflict zone for him. Shootouts between rival drug gangs terrify Yalini and Illayaal as they try to fit into their roles as mother and daughter. Yalini is pressured to accept a job as a nurse-maid to the father of the local drug lord. Sivadhasan attends to his duties in spite of the chaos that surrounds him but is drawn into the fight. Caught in the crossfire of a climactic gunfight, Sivadhasan's latent battle-readiness resurfaces, and he single-handedly destroys an entire gang with just a handgun, a machete, and a screwdriver. He rescues Yalini from her boss's blood-soaked apartment. Eventually, they all manage to immigrate to England, where they find real peace.",

    "Synopsis": "Famed war photographer Isabelle Reed dies in a car crash. Three years later, a retrospective exhibition celebrating her work, as well as an article about her life and death, is slated for release. This puts her widower, Gene, in a crisis, as their younger son, Conrad, has no idea that she died by suicide. Conrad, meanwhile, is angry, aggressive, and seemingly suicidal himself. He frequently fantasizes about his mother and her death and obsesses over one of his female classmates. Jonah, Isabelle and Gene's oldest child, comes down to visit his father and Conrad. He goes over his mother's work before it is donated to the museum. Though Jonah appears to Gene to be stable, he refuses to believe that Isabelle died by suicide and censors her work, deleting some of her photographs which appear to show her having an affair. Later, at the hospital, when his child is being born, Jonah runs into Erin, an old girlfriend whose mother is dying of cancer. He allows her to believe that his wife also has cancer. Wanting to return home after visiting his father and brother, Jonah stops by Erin's house and the two have sex. Jonah says that he has never told his wife about Isabelle or the way that she died. After the encounter, rather than return home, he goes back to Gene's house and lies to his wife, saying that the family needs him more than he expected. Jonah and Conrad bond. Conrad allows Jonah to read portions of his diary, which explains his seemingly odd and random behaviour. Conrad wants to give the diary to Melanie, the girl he has a crush on, but Jonah dissuades him from doing so, saying that he will be humiliated. Conrad ignores the advice and prints out his diary, leaving it on Melanie's doorstep. Gene gives Isabelle's work to an old friend of hers, Richard, who is authoring the article about her. He is given permission to curate her work to see what is personal and what is not. Richard reveals that he and Isabelle had an ongoing affair overseas but that she was never interested in continuing it at home. Richard's article comes out earlier than expected and Jonah takes the news poorly. As Gene has not had the chance to tell Conrad yet, he repeatedly tries to contact him, but Conrad ignores him and goes to a party. There, he is able to spend time with Melanie, who is drunk, so he walks her home. After returning to his own home, Conrad asks his father if what the article said about Isabelle is true. He accepts the news graciously, but tells his father that Jonah is handling the situation badly. Jonah is unable to return home, having avoided his wife and child for a while now, but Gene offers to drive him there. As Gene, Conrad, and Jonah drive towards Jonah's home, Conrad recounts a dream he had in which his mother brought home a baby from overseas, who was an old man, who was actually Jonah's baby.",

    "Synopsis": "The film starts with the Macbeths grieving at their child's funeral. Then, Macbeth leads King Duncan's troops into a civil war battle. He emerges victorious, despite losses, including boy soldiers. Three women with a girl and infant approach Macbeth and Banquo, hailing Macbeth as Thane of Cawdor and future King, and Banquo as a father of Kings, before disappearing. Duncan hears of Macbeth's victory and executes the Thane of Cawdor for traitorously allying with Norse invaders, giving Macbeth his title. Macbeth tells his wife of the prophecies. Lady Macbeth prays to the dark spirits for guidance. When Macbeth says Duncan will stay overnight, she urges him to kill the King to fulfill the prophecy. A feast is held, where the King pronounces Malcolm his heir. Macbeth hesitates but Lady Macbeth persuades him to kill Duncan while she drugs his servants. After the feast, Macbeth sees a boy soldier's ghost, who gives him a dagger and leads him towards the tent of Duncan whom Macbeth slays. Malcolm enters and, seeing the body, flees. Shaken, Macbeth goes to his wife, giving her two daggers. Lady Macbeth rebukes him for not leaving them and puts them in the sleeping servants' hands. She meets Macbeth in the church where they wash their hands, saying they have washed their deed away. In the morning, Macduff finds Duncan dead and Macbeth slaughters the servants to prevent their denial. Macduff and Noble Lennox believe Malcolm's flight is suspicious and admire Macbeth's summary justice. With Malcolm gone, Macbeth is crowned. Afterward, he sourly complains to his wife that killing Duncan was for nothing as Macbeth has no heirs, so the crown will pass to Banquo and his son, Fleance, as prophesied. He invites them to a banquet but discovers they plan to leave, as Banquo is suspicious. Macbeth sends assassins: Banquo is killed, but Fleance escapes. During the evening, Macbeth mentions Banquo not attending as promised. Macbeth asks the assassins for news and is enraged that Fleance has escaped. Then, Macbeth sees Banquo's ghost. Afraid, he talks to it. Lady Macbeth says her husband is unwell, but Macbeth continues to rave, prompting Macduff and his wife to leave. Lady Macbeth dismisses the guests and takes Macbeth away. Macbeth talks to the witches. They show him a vision of slain soldiers who tell him to beware Macduff, and that Macbeth shall be King until Great Birnam Wood comes to the royal castle at Dunsinane Hill. The boy soldier's ghost who gave him the dagger tells Macbeth that he will not be slain by man born of a woman. The King is found wandering by Lennox who tells him that Macduff has fled. Anxious and enraged, Macbeth orders the death of Macduff's family and servants. The family are burned at the stake, while a distraught Lady Macbeth watches. Afterwards, she washes the daggers. Meanwhile, Macduff meets Malcolm, who is gathering troops. Ross and Angus inform Macduff about his household's murder. Grief-stricken and angry, Macduff swears revenge. Guilt-ridden, Lady Macbeth returns to the church, lamenting their deeds and her bloody hands. She sees her child's ghost, which she urges to sleep. Then she wanders in the hills and sees the witches. In the castle, Macbeth is rumoured mad, and all fear his anger and tyranny. He is told of his wife's death. Speaking the famous soliloquy, starting \"tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow\" (also known by the lines in it beginning \"Out, out, brief candle!\"), he carries her body in despair. Seyton brings news that Malcolm is leading an army and Macbeth demands his armour. Macduff fires Birnam Wood: with smoke blowing towards them, the prophecy is fulfilled. Macbeth sallies out and duels with Macduff. Macbeth is confident, as \"no man born of woman\" can kill him, and he defeats Macduff, a dagger at his throat. Macduff states he was untimely ripped from his mother's womb and Macbeth drops his dagger, saying he won't fight (the prophecy). Macbeth regrets his mistakes, knowing redemption is impossible. Macbeth refuses to bow before Malcolm and goads Macduff into killing him. The witches, observing, leave. Malcolm is hailed King and all go to his castle. Malcolm leaves the throne room while Fleance takes Macbeth's sword and charges through the empty battlefield, disappearing into the smoke.",

As children, Julien and Marguerite shared a close relationship and were deeply devoted to each other. After Julien saves Marguerite from a horse riding incident, their uncle, Abbot, feels uneasiness in the siblings’ relationship. He advises their father, Jean, to send Julien and his older brother, Phillipe, to study abroad on the excuse Marguerite is distracting their education. Six years pass, during which Marguerite refuses to marry and spends her time alone. When Julien and Phillipe return, Marguerite shares a joyous reunion with Julien. Their parents arrange for her to be betrothed to Marigny, who is crippled but kind to Marguerite. However, Marguerite is uninterested and Julien exhibits jealousy towards Marigny. During dinner with Marigny, Julien excuses himself with Marguerite following him. It is the first time Julien and Marguerite are alone with each other and the attraction is too much to overcome. They try and fight it since they are not willing to admit that they are in love. Instead, they play an increasingly sexual game that includes trying to make the other shudder and squirm. After being gone for a while, their parents find them partially undressed and punish them for causing Marigny to cancel the engagement. Marguerite later meets with Julien in secret and confesses her love to him but, although he reciprocates, he rejects her. She tries to kiss him but he quickly leaves. Shortly after, Marguerite is married to Lefevbre, a wealthy tax collector. When he tries to initiate sex with Marguerite, she locks him out of her bedroom. The marriage quickly becomes extremely unhappy and Lefevbre begins physically abusing Marguerite. She tries to seek help from her parents but they demand she stay with her husband. Julien later finds out what is happening and frees Marguerite by beating Lefebvre and allowing her to return home. That same night, Julien and Marguerite have sex for the first time. A maid catches Julien in bed with Marguerite, and tells their parents. Their father contemplates sending Julien away but their mother, wanting to make her children happy, arranges for them to secretly run away together. Lefevbre files charges against Julien and Marguerite for incest and adultery, and they are declared fugitives. After traveling for several weeks, they arrive in Barfleur, and Marguerite discovers she is pregnant. Marguerite disguises herself as a man to hide her identity but the authorities receive a tip on their whereabouts. Before they can board a ship to England, they are arrested. At trial, both deny the charges and claim they ran away because Julien helped Marguerite escape from her abusive husband. Their father petitions King Henri IV to spare his children but the king says he cannot tolerate incest and refuses to pardon them. Meanwhile, Marguerite gives birth to a son, who is placed in the care of a nunnery. At the trial's conclusion, Julien and Marguerite are found guilty and sentenced to death. Marguerite pleads for her brother to be released and screams she is the only one guilty but no one listens to her. The next day, Julien and Marguerite arrive at Place de Grève for their execution. Julien is executed first and Marguerite dies from the shock before she too is decapitated. After the execution, the Château is abandoned. Julien and Marguerite's father and brother arrange to have the baby snuck out of the nunnery. The nun that brings them the baby reveals Marguerite named the baby Julien prior to her death. The de Ravalet family leaves, taking the baby with them.",

Tao's affection for Jinsheng sets off a confrontation between her two suitors that eventually turns violent. When Tao and Jinsheng decide to get married, Liangzi, feeling incapable of maintaining a platonic friendship with Tao, leaves town. In 2014, Tao and Jinsheng are now divorced.

Liangzi returns from his job as a miner near Handan; suffering from black lung, he receives financial help from Tao. Tao and Jinsheng's 7-year-old son, Daole (Dollar in English), comes to attend the funeral of Tao's father. Tao is upset by how distant he has become, and behaves surly towards him. Knowing they are fated to be apart as Daole and Jinsheng are soon to emigrate to Australia, Tao decides to ride the slow train with Daole to spend more time with him. As a parting gift, she gives Daole a set of keys for her house so that he can return to his home whenever he wants. In 2025, Daole (now going by Dollar) is attending college in Australia. He constantly fights with his father over his desire to drop out and have the freedom he was never granted in his childhood. He develops feelings for Mia, an older woman and his Chinese language teacher, and the two eventually begin a relationship. Dollar shares with Mia how he still carries the keys his mother gave him when he was a young boy, and that he fears she may die even though they have not talked for years. Mia asks him to fly back to China with her so that he can see Tao, though he is hesitant. Back in Fenyang, Tao recalls the song \"Go West\" and dances alone in the snow.",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot section should between 400–700 words. --> In Chandler, Arizona, FBI special agents Kate Macer and Reggie Wayne lead a raid on a Sonora Cartel safe house, where they discover dozens of decaying corpses hidden in the walls. Outside, an explosive booby trap kills two police officers. Following the raid, Kate is recommended for and joins a joint task force overseen by CIA SAC officer Matt Graver and the secretive Alejandro Gillick, a Mexican prosecutor turned CIA-trained assassin. Their mission is to flush out and apprehend Sonora lieutenant Manuel Díaz, currently operating and hiding in the United States. The team, which includes Delta Force operators, Deputy US Marshals, and CIA personnel, travels to Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, to extradite Díaz's brother, Guillermo. While crossing the El Paso–Juárez border, the team is ambushed by low-level cartel hitmen, whom the Americans swiftly kill. During the gunfight, Kate is forced to kill a Federal Police officer in self-defense, and is left visibly horrified by the violence. Back in the U.S., Alejandro tortures Guillermo and learns that the cartel uses a tunnel near Nogales, Sonora, to smuggle drugs. Meanwhile, Kate confronts Matt, who reveals that the real mission is to disrupt Díaz's drug operations so he can lead them to his boss, drug lord Fausto Alarcón. Unnerved, Kate asks Reggie to join her for support. The task force raids a bank used to launder Díaz's money. After finding financial evidence, Kate and Reggie want to start a legal case against Díaz but are ordered to stand down to avoid jeopardizing the operation. At a bar, Reggie introduces Kate to Ted, a Phoenix Police officer. Kate and Ted become intimate at her apartment, but she realizes Ted is working with the cartel. In the ensuing struggle, Ted begins to strangle Kate before Alejandro appears and subdues him. Alejandro and Matt brutally beat and threaten Ted to coerce him into revealing the names of other officers working for Díaz. After the team learns that Díaz has been recalled to Mexico, they prepare to raid the tunnel near Nogales. Matt reveals to Kate and Reggie that their involvement is a technical necessity as the CIA is not allowed to operate alone within US borders. An angered Reggie tells Kate they should leave, but she insists on staying to learn about the mission's true purpose. As a gunfight with the cartel begins, Kate follows Alejandro into Mexico. She sees him abduct Silvio, a corrupt Sonora police officer working as one of Díaz's drug mules. Kate attempts to arrest Alejandro, but he shoots her twice in her Kevlar vest to subdue her, angrily telling her to never point a gun at him again, before driving away with Silvio at gunpoint. On the U.S. side of the border, Kate confronts Matt, who explains the mission is part of a broader operation to revert the various drug cartels back to a single Colombian-run business that the U.S. can more easily control and work with. Alejandro, who previously worked for the Medellín Cartel, was hired to assassinate Alarcón, the man responsible for ordering the murder of Alejandro's wife and daughter when he was a prosecutor in Juárez. Alejandro kills Silvio after he stops Díaz's vehicle and forces Díaz to drive to Alarcón's estate. On arrival, he quickly kills Díaz and Alarcón's guards; finding the family seated to dinner, he vengefully kills Alarcón's wife and two sons first and then kills Alarcón. The next day, Alejandro appears in Kate's apartment and forces her at gunpoint to sign a statement attesting that the entire operation was legal. As he leaves, she aims her pistol at him and Alejandro turns to face her, but she cannot bring herself to pull the trigger. In Nogales, Silvio's widow watches her son's soccer game, which is briefly interrupted by the sound of distant machine-gun fire.",

    "film_title": "Son of Saul",
    "Synopsis": "In October 1944, Jewish–Hungarian prisoner Saul Ausländer works as a Sonderkommando at the gas chambers in Auschwitz. He works stoically, seemingly numbed by the daily atrocities. Among the dead after a gassing, Saul sees a still living boy suffocated by a Nazi doctor who calls for an autopsy. Saul carries the body to Miklós Nyiszli, a fellow Hungarian prisoner and a forced assistant to Josef Mengele, and asks him to not cut up the boy so that he can receive a proper Jewish burial. Miklós declines, but says he can have five minutes alone with the boy that night before the cremation. Saul asks Rabbi Frankel to help perform a funeral ritual, but the rabbi dismisses him and suggests that Saul perform the burial himself. Saul overhears Sonderkommando Abraham talk about an uprising with Oberkapo Biederman. Biederman first wants to photograph the camp's horrors using a camera collected from the dead, and smuggle the pictures outside to attract attention and help. Abraham tells Saul of \"the Renegade\", a Greek Rabbi who has lost his faith. In return, Saul offers his assistance in their plan. He pretends to fix the lock of a shack, while a fellow prisoner hides inside and takes pictures of a cremation in a fire pit. Saul sneaks into another Sonderkommando unit and finds the Renegade at a riverbank, where ashes are dumped into the river. The Renegade refuses to help; Saul in turn throws the man's shovel into the water. The rabbi jumps into the river but Saul pulls him out, and both are then taken to the SS-commandant of the unit. After an interrogation, the Renegade is executed and Saul is allowed to go back to the unit. Back at the camp, Saul sneaks into Miklós's office but fails to find the boy's body, before being mocked and kicked out of the room by a group of Nazi officers. He confronts Miklós, who assures him that the body has been hidden for safety. Saul finds the body and takes it back to his own barrack in a sack. That night, SS-commandant Moll orders Biederman to write up a list of seventy names, leading Biederman to believe that his unit will soon be killed. Biederman discloses the information to Abraham, who instructs Saul to head to the women's camp and pick up a package of gunpowder from a prisoner named Ella. Ella, who knows Saul, calls him by name and clasps his hand, but he withdraws. After collecting the package, Saul looks for a rabbi among a line of newly arrived Hungarian Jews, who are being led into the woods for execution. A Frenchman named Braun approaches him and convinces Saul that he is a rabbi. Saul disguises Braun as a Sonderkommando and sneaks him into the camp. When Saul arrives at the camp, he is confronted by Abraham and realizes that during the turmoil in the woods he has lost the package. On further questioning, he says that the murdered boy is his illegitimate son, an assertion Abraham says is not true. The next morning, the prisoners are summoned into the crematorium to get back to work, where they discover that Biederman and his unit have been murdered. Abraham rallies the other prisoners and attack the SS guards, starting the rebellion. During the commotion, Saul retrieves the boy's corpse and escapes to the woods with Braun and few other prisoners. He prepares to bury the boy by a river, only to discover that Braun is a fraud when he cannot recite the Kaddish. Hearing the guards approaching, Saul tries to carry the body across the river, but loses his grasp and is pulled out of the water by Rabbi Frankel as the corpse floats away. The prisoners then hide at a shed in a forest and start to discuss a plan to join the Polish resistance. Saul notices a young peasant boy peeking into the shed and smiles for the only time in the story. The boy runs away before an SS officer grabs and silences him as guards approach the shed. The officer then releases him, and the boy runs into the woods as the sound of gunfire echoes behind him.",

The virgin cook prepares the heart and becomes pregnant and the Queen eats the heart and the next day bears a son, Elias, with hair as white as the dragon. The cook also gives birth to a boy, Jonah. The boys are identical and inseparable friends. This so vexes the Queen that she attempts to murder Jonah, though he manages to escape.

Elias leaves to find Jonah. The Queen has her subjects search for Elias to no avail. The necromancer blames the Queen and says the youths are truly inseparable and that her violent desire can be achieved only through violence. Elias finds Jonah wounded in a cave.

    "Synopsis": "The Assassin is loosely based on the late seventh-century martial arts story \"Nie Yinniang\" by Pei Xing, a core text in Chinese swordsmanship and wuxia fiction. The film is set in China during the Zhenyuan ( ) reign period (785 to 805) in the middle of the Tang dynasty, a few years after the An Lushan rebellion (755 to 763). The circuit of Weibo, though nominally a part of the Tang Empire, is de facto ruled independently by military governor Tian Ji'an. The film centers on Nie Yinniang, an assassin who is directed to slay corrupt government officials by her master, Jiaxin, a nun who raised her from the age of ten. When Yinniang displays mercy by failing to kill during her duties, Jiaxin punishes her with a ruthless assignment designed to test Yinniang's resolve: she is sent to the distant circuit of Weibo in northern China to kill its military governor, her cousin Tian Ji'an, to whom she was betrothed as a child. As Princess Jiacheng recounts to her when she arrives, the betrothal was a consequence of Jiacheng's own marriage. Jiacheng was married off to an official of Weibo to quell unrest in Weibo, whereupon she adopted her husband's son, Tian Ji'an as her own. At her request, Tian Ji'an was betrothed to Yinniang at the age of fifteen. However, the betrothal was canceled in favor of a politically pressing marriage, and Yinniang was sent off to live with Princess Jiacheng's sister the nun Jiaxin. Yinniang wrestles with her mission to kill Tian Ji'an, especially in front of his children. When Yinniang's uncle Tian Xing expresses views Tian Ji'an finds offensive in a meeting of state, Tian Ji'an demotes Tian Xing and sends him away to Linqing under the protection of Nie Feng, Yinniang's father. They are soon ambushed, but Yinniang arrives in time to rescue them. She accompanies the wounded survivors to a village where they meet a young mirror-polisher. Yinniang protects Tian Ji'an on the journey where she was expected to kill him, and eventually tells Jiaxin that killing him while his sons were young would have plunged Weibo into chaos. Jiaxin dismisses Yinniang for her emotional failures after praising her unmatched martial skills. Yinniang then spares the life of the old nun before joining the traveling mirror-polisher as his guardian.",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot must be generic and CANNOT EXTEND BEYOND 400-700 WORDS! DO NOT EXTEND UNLESS NECESSARY! --> David is escorted to a hotel after his wife leaves him for another man. The hotel manager reveals that single people have 45 days to find a partner or they will be transformed into an animal of their choice (the dog accompanying David is his brother Bob). David is set on becoming a lobster, should he fail. David makes the acquaintance of Robert, a man with a lisp, and John, a man with a limp. Guests are fixated on finding a mate with whom they share superficial traits such as minor ailments, which they believe to be the key to compatibility. The hotel has many rules and rituals: masturbation is banned, but sexual stimulation by the hotel maid is mandatory, and guests attend dances and watch propaganda extolling the advantages of partnership. Residents can extend their deadline by hunting and tranquilizing the single people who live in the forest, with each captured \"loner\" earning them an additional day. On the way to a hunt, a woman with a fondness for butter biscuits offers David sexual favours, which he declines. She tells him that if she fails to find a mate, she will kill herself by jumping from a hotel window. John wins the affections of a woman with constant nosebleeds by purposely smashing his nose in secret. They move to the couples' section to begin a month-long trial partnership. David later decides to court a notoriously cruel woman who has tranquilized more loners than anyone else. Their initial conversation is accompanied by the screams of the biscuit-loving woman, who has injured herself by jumping from a first floor window. David pretends to enjoy the woman's suffering to gain the heartless woman's interest. He later joins her in a hot tub where she feigns choking on an olive to test him. Noticing that he makes no attempt to help her, she decides that they are a match, and the two are shifted to the couples' suite. David wakes up one morning and finds she has killed Bob. As David tearfully mourns him, she concludes that their relationship is a lie and attempts to drag him to the hotel manager to have him punished, turned into the \"animal that no one wants to be\". He escapes and, with the help of a sympathetic maid (later revealed as a mole working for the loners), tranquilizes his partner and transforms her into an unspecified animal. David escapes the hotel and joins the loners in the woods. In contrast to the hotel, they forbid any kind of romance, which is punishable by mutilation. David, who is short-sighted, begins a secret relationship with a woman who is also short-sighted. They develop a gestural language they use to communicate. They are taken on covert missions to the nearby city, where their cover requires them to appear as husband and wife, which they secretly enjoy. The loners launch a raid to sabotage the hotel. David tells the woman with nosebleeds that John has been faking his. Other loners hold the hotel manager and her husband at gunpoint, tricking him into shooting his wife to save himself, but the gun is not loaded. They leave the couple to face each other. The leader of the loners obtains the short-sighted woman's journal and discovers David's plan to escape with her. The leader and the maid take the woman to the city, ostensibly to have an operation to cure her short-sightedness, but instead have her blinded. The woman attempts to stab the leader, but the leader uses the maid as a human shield and pretends to die when the woman stabs the maid to death. David and the woman try to find something else that they have in common, to no avail. One morning, David overpowers the leader, leaving her tied up in an open grave to be eaten alive by wild dogs. He and the blind woman escape to the city and stop at a restaurant. David goes to the restroom and hesitantly prepares to blind himself with a steak knife.",

    "Synopsis": "Arthur Brennan, an adjunct physics professor, travels to Aokigahara (\"The Suicide Forest\") with a sealed package. Once there, he attempts to end his life via drug overdose but encounters a Japanese man named Takumi Nakamura. Takumi entered the forest two days prior and slit his wrists because he was demoted at work, but soon realized he would miss his wife and daughter. Since then, he has tried to escape the dense sea of trees but cannot find the trail back. Arthur decides to help but the two end up disoriented and lost. To keep their minds occupied, they share details about their lives, including the names of Takumi's wife and daughter: \"Kiiro\" and \"Fuyu\". Through flashbacks, it is revealed that Arthur lived in a crumbling marriage alongside his wife Joan, a real estate agent. Joan resented Arthur for his affair with Gabriella, his coworker, and always putting his own needs before their needs as a couple. Arthur despised Joan's alcoholism and constant need to demean him for earning less money than her. One night, Joan suffers a heavy nosebleed after a vicious argument. They go to the hospital, where she is diagnosed with a brain tumor. Joan and Arthur slowly rekindle their love for each other. After her surgery, they reminisce about trips to their lake house where Joan would spend hours walking amongst the orchids. He says he will take her there when she is fully recovered. Joan is transported to a recovery hospital. Arthur follows behind the ambulance in his car while talking to her on the phone. He jokes about not knowing what her favorite color or season is. Before Joan can respond, a truck plows into the ambulance, killing her. At her funeral, Arthur tells the funeral director he did not really know her even after being married for years. The director replies he overheard one of Joan's sisters saying she mailed a copy of Joan's favorite book to Arthur's house. Back in the present, Arthur and Takumi struggle to escape the forest. They survive falls, a flash flood, dehydration, and hypothermia over the course of a single night. Along the way, they encounter the bodies of others who succeeded in ending their lives. They take refuge in a tent with a corpse who brought emergency supplies with him. Sitting by a campfire, Arthur tells Takumi he is in the forest because of his guilt over how he and Joan treated each other. The next morning, Arthur leaves an ill Takumi by the tent to try and find help. He promises Takumi he will come back for him. Arthur uses the walkie-talkie from the deceased camper and makes contact with the park rangers. He tries to help but is too weak to inform them that Takumi is still in the forest. 12 days later, Arthur is being evaluated by a hospital psychiatrist before his release. His plans are to return to the forest and find Takumi; the psychiatrist informs him that the rangers found the tent he spoke of but did not find anyone there. She also claims that there is no one by the name of Takumi Nakamura who has a wife and daughter with the names Takumi mentioned, and that the camera at the entrance to the park only shows Arthur entering the forest. Arthur returns to the forest and finds the unopened package he left behind when he first found Takumi. Arthur locates the tent and coat he used to cover Takumi for warmth but finds a beautiful orchid in Takumi's place. He remembers Takumi describing the forest as a form of purgatory, where the spirits of your loved ones are closest during your darkest moments. He opens the package containing Joan's favorite book: a copy of Hansel and Gretel. Arthur realizes that Takumi was Joan's spirit and is helping him heal his guilt. Arthur returns to the United States and brings the orchid with him. During office hours, Arthur's student Eric reveals that the names of Takumi's wife and daughter are not names but words that mean \"yellow\" and \"winter\". Arthur remembers the last conversation he had with his wife about her favorite color and season. He travels to the lake house and plants the orchid in Joan's garden.",

    "Synopsis": "Gérard and Isabelle, a French couple separated for decades, meet up at a desert motel in California. Each has received a letter from their son Michaël, who killed himself in San Francisco six months earlier, asking them to visit certain spots in Death Valley on certain days, when he will reappear to them. While Isabelle has stayed petite and attractive, she is shocked to see that Gérard is in poor health and enormous. The two squabble and sentimentalise, sometimes wondering if an old flame could be reignited and sometimes sick of the other's company. Grumbling at the apparent pointlessness of the mission, and wilting under the intense heat, they nevertheless follow Michaël's instructions. One night back at the motel, Isabelle panics and Gérard rushes to her room. She is convinced there was an intruder, who could have been Michaël. She says he seized her ankles, which afterwards exhibit a mysterious inflammation. Out together in the desert, Gérard walks on alone and returns to Isabelle in panic, convinced that he met Michaël, who seized his wrists. Later, they too become inflamed. The film ends there, leaving viewers to ponder what meaning the couple will draw from their experience and whether it may bring them closer again.",

    "Synopsis": "Septuagenarian best friends Fred Ballinger and Mick Boyle are on vacation in the Swiss Alps, staying at a luxury spa/resort in Flims. Fred is a retired composer of classical music; at the hotel, he is approached by an emissary for Queen Elizabeth II, conferring a knighthood and asking him to perform his popular piece \"Simple Song #3\" at Prince Philip's birthday concert. Fred turns down the offer, claiming he is not interested in performing any more – although he still composes pieces in his head when alone. Mick is a film director, and is working with a group of writers to develop the screenplay for his latest film, which he calls his \"testament\". Also with them is actor Jimmy Tree, who is researching for an upcoming role and frustrated that he is only remembered for his role as a robot. The hotel is inhabited by other quirky individuals, including a young masseuse, an overweight Diego Maradona, and Miss Universe. Fred and Mick reflect on their lives, admitting that their memories are fading and that they see little in their futures. Fred's daughter and assistant, Lena, is married to Mick's son, but the latter leaves her for pop star Paloma Faith. Lena stays at the resort and vents her anger at her father, who was always distant as she grew up. The emissary returns, and Lena cries as Fred explains that he won't perform \"Simple Song #3\" because the soprano part belongs only to his wife and she can no longer sing. Mick completes his screenplay and is satisfied with it. The main role is written for aging diva Brenda Morel, who has starred in eleven of his previous films. Brenda surprises Mick by arriving at the resort, and telling him that she is taking a television role instead; cinema is the past, she says, and Mick hasn't made a good film in years. Disheartened, Mick commits suicide by jumping from a balcony in front of Fred. Fred decides to visit his wife for the first time in years. She is senile, and living at a care home in Venice. He then returns to the UK to conduct \"Simple Song #3\" in front of the Queen and Prince. Interspersed throughout the film are surreal sequences, including a levitating monk, an imagined Paloma Faith music video, Jimmy dressed as Adolf Hitler, Fred conducting a field of cowbells, and Mick envisioning all his previous leading ladies on a mountaintop (including Brenda, in her new unglamorous TV role).",

    "Synopsis": "In the early 1990s, a group of HIV/AIDS activists associated with the Paris chapter of ACT UP struggle to effect action to fight the AIDS epidemic. While the French government has declared its intent to support HIV/AIDS sufferers, ACT UP stages public protests against their sluggish pace, accusing the government of censoring and minimizing the fight against the virus. When the pharmaceutical company Melton Pharm announces its plans to reveal its HIV trial results at a prominent pharmaceutical conference the following year, ACT UP invades its offices with fake blood and demands it release its trial results immediately. While ACT UP makes some headway with its public protests, its members fiercely debate the group's strategy, with conflicting goals of showmanship and persuasion, with conflicting aesthetics of positivity and misery. ACT UP struggles to plan a more effective Gay Pride parade than in previous years, bemoaning the depressing, \"zombie\" atmosphere the AIDS epidemic had created. The film shows a number of large meetings in a lecture theatre where the radical element demand more direct action and others aim to bring the scientists to meetings where they can get them to communicate results sooner. A deaf person points out they can do direct action AND pursue meetings with the labs. But soon some radicals have attacked Helene, the mother of a teenager who contracted HIV through blood transfusion. Helene had pushed for politicians to be tried and jailed for their mishandling of blood screening (which is how her son got HIV). To some this is against ACT-UP principles as prison is an unsafe place where people get HIV. The group always seem to be arguing. The film gradually shifts from the political storyline of ACT UP's actions to the personal stories of ACT UP members. Foreshadowing later events in the movie, Jeremie, a youth who lives with HIV in the group sees his health deteriorate rapidly. Per his wishes, the group parades in the streets after his death, putting his name and face to the ranks of AIDS victims. Newcomer Nathan, a gay man who doesn't live with HIV, begins to fall in love with the passionate veteran Sean, who is HIV-positive. Nathan and Sean start a sexual relationship, and discuss their sexual histories. Sean got HIV when he was sixteen from his married maths teacher. Sean is already exhibiting signs of the disease's progression and soon his T-cell count is down to 160. Nathan offers to care for Sean as he gets worse. When Sean is released from hospital to Nathan's apartment for end-of-life care, Nathan euthanizes him. ACT UP holds a wake at their home. As per Sean's wishes, later they invade a health insurance conference, throwing his ashes over the conference-goers and their food.",

    "Synopsis": "In New York City, Nick Nikas struggles with a court-ordered therapy session in which Peter, a psychiatrist, attempts to determine the extent of his cognitive and social impairment, touching upon a violent incident with his grandmother. Nick's brother Connie pulls him out of the session. The brothers rob a bank, but a dye pack in the bag of money explodes, causing their getaway driver to crash, and Connie and Nick flee on foot. Although they manage to remove the dye from their clothes, a police officer finds them suspicious and attempts to question them, and Nick runs. He is arrested and sent to Rikers Island, while Connie escapes. That night, Connie attempts to secure a bail bond to get Nick out of jail. Most of the money from the robbery was destroyed by the dye, but he convinces his girlfriend Corey to pay the remaining $10,000 with her mother's credit card, only to discover her mother has canceled it. When Connie learns a fight with another inmate has already put Nick in the hospital, he leaves Corey and goes there to free him. He finds an unconscious and bandaged patient guarded by a police officer, and sneaks him onto an Access-A-Ride bus. He tricks Annie, one of the other riders, into letting them wait in her house until morning. Connie watches TV with Crystal, Annie's 16-year-old granddaughter. When his mug shot appears on the news, he kisses her as a distraction. They are interrupted by the sounds of the patient regaining consciousness, and Connie discovers he did not break Nick out of the hospital, but rather a different criminal named Ray. Connie tells Crystal he wants to borrow Annie's car to take Ray home. On the way, Ray recounts the story of the day leading up to his arrest and hospitalization. He tells Connie about a bottle of LSD solution and bag of stolen money Ray's friends ditched in a haunted house ride in Adventureland while they were running from police. Connie deduces that the drugs and money are still there and he, Crystal, and Ray drive to Adventureland. Leaving Crystal in the car, Connie and Ray search for the money, but only find the LSD. They are caught by Dash, Adventureland's security guard, who says the police are on their way. Connie beats Dash unconscious and, when a police car arrives, steals Dash's uniform. Ray pours LSD down Dash's throat, and Connie convinces the officers that Dash is the intruder. Crystal is arrested when she gets out of Annie's car, and Connie watches the police take her away. Unable to find the money, Connie and Ray go to Dash's apartment, where Connie befriends Dash's pit bull by letting it smell Dash's jacket. Ray calls his friend Caliph to offer to sell back the LSD, and, while they wait for Caliph and the sun rises, Ray begins drinking. Connie tells Ray that he is a leech on society, and they have a heated argument. Caliph arrives without any money, and Connie, protected by the dog, tells him to come back with $15,000. Although Caliph agrees, he tells Ray that he is really going to get a gun. Sensing danger, Connie attempts to leave with the acid before Caliph returns. Ray attacks him in the hallway and tries to get the drugs, but Dash's dog attacks Ray. Connie gets away and Ray escapes into the apartment, where he looks out the window and sees Connie get caught by the police. There is a pounding at the door, and Ray attempts to reach a neighboring apartment by climbing out a window, but he slips. As Connie is being put in a police car, he witnesses Ray fall to his death. Later, Peter greets Nick and Nick's grandmother in a lobby. While he walks Nick back to join a class, Peter remarks that Connie did the \"right thing\", and both brothers are where they belong. Nick is initially very uncomfortable, but he gradually begins to participate in the group activity. As Nick begins to take part, Peter assures him that he will have a \"good time\".",

    "Synopsis": "The film starts with clips secretly filmed with a smartphone by Eve Laurent, a teenager, showing her mother and overlaid with text messages from Eve saying that her mother is selfish and uncaring. Eve feeds her hamster one of the sedatives and it dies. The last clip shows Eve's mother unconscious and Eve admitting that she poisoned her too with sedatives. The next scene shows security camera video depicting an accident at a construction site. The site's construction firm is owned by Anne Laurent, Eve's aunt. Anne is then shown having dinner with her father, Georges Laurent, who suffers from dementia, as well as her son Pierre, who works for the construction company and has a drinking problem; her brother, Thomas Laurent, who is a surgeon; and his wife Anaïs. They all live together in a large mansion in Calais. We learn that the accident injured one of the construction workers and he will probably not survive his injuries. Eve comes to live with her father's family while her mother is in the hospital, and begins to have suspicions that her father is having an affair. One day at the beach she overhears Thomas talking on his cellphone to a woman, and she asks him if he still loves Anaïs. Pierre goes to an apartment building in the banlieue where he is confronted and badly beaten by a young man, who is later identified as the son of the construction worker injured in the accident. Pierre then flees the mansion and hides in an empty apartment, where he is found by Anne. They have an argument during which she asks him why he started drinking, accuses him of not taking his job in the construction firm seriously, and tells him that had he gone to the police after being beaten up, their chances in their legal dispute with the family of the construction worker would be much better. We later see her and her lawyer talking with the family, offering some money and alluding to the legal consequences of the physical assault on Pierre by the worker's son. Pierre is later shown trying to embarrass his mother by calling one of the housemaids a \"slave\" in front of a large gathering during a party at the mansion. After Eve's mother falls into a coma as a result of the poisoning, which everyone believes was a suicide attempt, Eve is taken in by Thomas, her estranged father. She hacks into his computer and finds many e-mails and chat messages which show that he has a sadomasochistic sexual relationship with a female musician. Eve tries to commit suicide by taking the rest of the sedatives which she had pocketed. She survives and when her father asks her at her hospital bed why she did it, she confronts him with her knowledge of his affair and accuses him of not being able to love anyone, neither her mother, Anaïs, nor herself. Thomas is left speechless. A short time later, Eve's mother dies from the poisoning. Georges Laurent, depressed because of his dementia and frailty, had already tried to commit suicide before and is shown late at night driving off in a car which he steers directly into a tree in another suicide attempt. Now using a wheelchair due to bone fractures from the car crash, he asks his longtime barber to help obtain a gun or medication for another suicide attempt, but the barber refuses. After Eve's own attempt, Thomas asks Georges to talk to her and he asks her why she took the sedatives. When she does not answer, Georges tells her the story of how, when his wife became ill, she suffered so terribly that he finally smothered her and killed her. Eve tells him that shortly after her father left her mother, she was sent to a youth camp where she was prescribed sedatives. She did not take the medication herself but slipped it into the food of another girl in the camp whom she did not like. When the poisoning was detected Eve was sent home. When Georges asks her if she regrets doing it she says she doesn't, then claims she did. At a large party at a beach restaurant in honor of Anne's engagement, Pierre arrives late with several refugees from the Calais Jungle in tow. When he starts presenting them to the party crowd, Anne intervenes. He pushes her to the side, but she breaks his finger, obliging him to stop. While this is happening, Georges asks Eve to wheel him outside. Leaving the party unnoticed, he asks her to push him down a slipway toward the sea. They go to the edge of the water where he proceeds to wheel himself into the water up to his neck. As Eve starts recording this scene with her smartphone, the last scene of the film is seen through the lens of the phone: Georges is almost fully submerged in the water when Thomas and Anne rush down the slipway, with Anne casting a shocked look back at Eve.",

    "Synopsis": "Several years after he spent four years in prison for drug dealing, during which time he has studied business administration and gotten married, Kurdish-German Nuri Şekerci lives happily with his German wife, Katja, and their six-year-old son, Rocco. One day, Katja drops Rocco off at Nuri's office, a small travel agency in Hamburg, so she can spend the afternoon with a friend. Heading out, she warns a young blonde woman leaving her new bicycle in front of the store that it will get stolen if she doesn't lock it up. When Katja returns that night she finds the street blocked off after a nail bomb detonated, killing Nuri and Rocco. Distraught, Katja tells the police about the woman with the bike and comes to believe the attack to be the work of Neo-Nazis. The police rule out a Jihadist motive as Nuri was neither religious nor political and initially focus on revenge by drug traffickers, though they release a composite sketch of the blonde woman. After Katja declines Nuri's parents' request to bury the bodies in Turkey, Nuri's mother coldly informs her at the funeral that her grandson would still be alive if Katja had been a better mother. Devastated, Katja uses drugs and later attempts suicide by slashing her wrists, but changes her mind after hearing a voicemail from her lawyer Danilo Fava stating that two Neo-Nazi suspects, married couple André and Edda Möller, have been caught. At the Möller trial, André's father, disgusted with his son's actions, testifies how he found bags of nails, fertilizer, and diesel in the garage. The defense argues that another party could have gained access to the garage through a hidden key. Forensics match the bomb to the material found in the garage, which bears fingerprints from the couple and an unknown individual, who could have been a store employee but who the defense claims as an unknown culprit. Nikolaos Makris, a Greek hotel owner, claims the Möllers were staying in Greece at the time of the bombing. It is revealed he is a member of the far-right party Golden Dawn and the Möllers liked Facebook photos of him at a rally in Germany. Katja testifies about seeing Edda outside the office but the defense calls her testimony into question by pointing out her drug use. Unable to dispel reasonable doubt due to the shared storage, the potential alibi and Katja's questionable testimony, the court acquits the couple. Alerted to their location via a Facebook update, Katja searches for the Möllers in Greece by finding Makris' hotel. Katja follows Makris and finds the Möllers living in an RV on the beach. She builds a nail bomb and plants it under the vehicle in a backpack before changing her mind and retrieving it. After a few days' contemplation, she returns to the beach and sees the Möllers enter the RV. After a few moments, she enters wearing the backpack and detonates the bomb, killing herself and the Möllers.",

    "Synopsis": "Aryan Dashni from Homs, Syria, and his father are part of a group of refugees trying to cross the Hungarian border via boat. During the border crossing, Aryan and his father lose their papers and are separated when the group is discovered by a border guard unit and chaos ensues. Aryan is shot several times by police officer László, but instead of dying he mysteriously obtains the power to levitate. When he falls back down to earth he is apprehended and brought to the hospital ward of the closest refugee camp. Gábor Stern is a doctor who works at the hospital ward of the refugee camp. He worked at a normal hospital before, but one night when drunk he made a mistake during surgery which killed an aspiring young athlete; he lost his job at the hospital and was sued by the victim's family. He is now trying to obtain enough money to bribe the family to drop their lawsuit. He does this by selling medical referrals to refugees which let them go from the camp to a hospital in Budapest from where they can flee. His girlfriend Vera, a doctor at the hospital, is in on the scheme. Gábor is seen selling one of the referrals to a refugee who had been in Aryan's group and who uses the name of Aryan's father, using the documents he had stolen from the Dashnis during the chaotic border crossing. It is also shown that Aryan's father is one of the many refugees who drowned during the border crossing. When Gábor comes to the ward and tries to examine Aryan, he begins to levitate again. Shocked and fascinated, Gábor helps Aryan flee the camp and makes him an offer: Gábor will bring Aryan to Budapest, where he will play a spiritual healer and use Aryan as an assistant who will show off his new talents to impress their patients/victims. They will share the money earned, and once they made enough money Gábor will help Aryan find his father. The first healing sessions are successful and they make a lot of money. But László, who also knows about Aryan's abilities, is closely following both using the help of the police forces. They manage to escape the police several times with the help of Vera. When Aryan goes to the illicit refugee camp at Budapest Keleti railway station, where his father had told him to meet up in case they were separated, he notices the other refugee who stole their papers. That other refugee is part of a terrorist plot to bomb the Budapest Metro. When Aryan follows the terrorist, Gábor loses contact with him. Both Aryan and the terrorist enter a subway, and seconds later the bomb that the terrorist is carrying explodes, killing dozens of people, although Aryan is not wounded badly. He leaves the subway and floats to the roof of a nearby apartment building, being watched by a shocked woman. After losing Aryan, thinking he has died, and finding out that Aryan's father has died, Gábor feels deep remorse for exploiting Aryan. He goes to the family of the man his medical malpractice killed and gives them his money as a bribe. When they refuse the money, he sincerely asks for forgiveness for his mistake and leaves. When he returns to the place of the terrorist attack, he overhears a woman who prays for an \"angel\" who \"flew to the sky\". Gábor correctly deduces that Aryan floated onto the roof of a building and finds him there. Gábor tells him that his father has died, they embrace, and Gábor brings Aryan back to the hospital to tend to his wounds, asking Vera for help again. But since the terrorist used the Dashnis' papers, everyone now believes Aryan to be one of the terrorists. Vera calls the police. Gábor and Aryan manage to flee after a car chase and after Aryan uses his abilities again. They take refuge in a hotel. When Gábor goes out to get help from a medic, he is betrayed and is apprehended by László. He tells the police where they can find Aryan, and he is brought to the hotel. Once inside the hotel's elevator, Gábor tries to escape but is knocked down by Laszlo, who continues on alone to Aryan's room. Laszlo apprehends Aryan and brings him down to the hotel lobby, but Gabor manages to overpower a policeman and takes his gun, holding him hostage. This allows Aryan to get away from Laszlo, but Gabor is shot. In the elevator, they use a cigarette to set off the fire alarm, and Gabor tells Ayran to get to a fire escape and fly away. When Aryan is cornered in a hotel hallway by László, Gábor arrives just in time to threaten László with a gun and give Aryan time to jump through a window and float away. Gábor dies and László runs to the window to shoot Aryan, but he lowers his weapon after hesitating. The final scene shows hundreds of people looking to the sky in amazement.",

    "Synopsis": "October 2012, Moscow. Children are leaving school. A twelve-year-old boy named Alyosha walks along a path through a wooded area on the outskirts of town. He throws a strip of tape onto a tree. His parents, Zhenya and Boris, are divorcing and are trying to sell their apartment. Both parents have new relationships: Boris with Masha, a young woman who is pregnant with his child; and Zhenya with Anton, an older and wealthier man with an adult daughter. Alyosha overhears a fight between his parents, neither of whom claim to want him and are considering placing him in an orphanage. One day after spending most of the night with Anton, Zhenya realizes Alyosha has not been seen since the day before. The police believe Alyosha has run away and will return home within a day or two. When Alyosha does not return, a volunteer group specializing in the rescue of missing persons takes over the case and begins searching for the boy. The only relative Alyosha could have sought refuge with is Zhenya's estranged mother, who lives several hours away. Boris and Zhenya visit Zhenya's mother; their trip is punctuated by arguments, and they do not find any clues as to Alyosha's whereabouts. On the return journey home, Zhenya and Boris argue again; Zhenya says her marriage to Boris while pregnant was a mistake and she should have had an abortion; she also says she feels pity for Masha. Enraged, Boris stops the car and forces her out on a rural roadway. The police again become involved with the search for Alyosha, which covers an increasingly wide area of the town and its surrounding area. After a fruitless search of an abandoned building that Alyosha's friend, Kuznetsov, identified as their hideout, Zhenya and Boris go to a morgue to view the remains of an unidentified child whose description matches Alyosha's. Both parents deny the disfigured child's body is their son's, though the experience proves traumatic and they break down in tears. Some time passes; Boris and Zhenya's apartment has been sold, and workers dismantle wall hangings and appliances in Alyosha's old room. On the streets, missing-person posters of Alyosha are looking old and faded. In 2015, Boris now lives with Masha and their infant son, whom he treats coldly, while Zhenya has moved in with Anton. Three years after his disappearance, on the wooded path along which Alyosha used to walk home from school, the strip of tape he threw onto the tree remains as a surviving remnant of his existence.",

    "Synopsis": "In 2007, \"environmentalist\" Lucy Mirando becomes CEO of the Mirando Corporation, succeeding her twin sister. Announcing they have been breeding a special kind of \"super pig\", 26 specimens are sent to farmers around the world, and ten years later, one will be crowned the winner as the best pig. In 2017, a teenage girl named Mija lives in South Korea with her grandfather and their super pig, Okja. Mija and Okja have a very close relationship; they spend much of their time together, and at one point, Okja saves Mija from falling off a cliff. They are visited by Mirando spokesperson and zoologist Dr. Johnny Wilcox, who declares Okja the best super pig, and announces that they will take her to New York City. Her grandfather gives Mija a solid gold pig figurine, explaining he saved up to replace Okja when she was taken away. Devastated, Mija goes to Seoul to find Okja, where she sees her being loaded onto a truck. Mija chases down the truck, but it is intercepted by the Animal Liberation Front. In the resulting chaos, Mija and Okja run away but are eventually saved by the ALF, led by Jay. He asks another ALF member, K, to translate and tell Mija that they plan to put a recording device in Okja's ear and let her be recaptured by the Mirando Corporation to document how they mistreat animals. Mija asks them to return her to the mountains, but K purposely mistranslates and tells them Mija agrees. They leave, and Okja is recaptured. To minimize PR damage to the company, Lucy pays for Mija to come to New York to stage a heart-warming reunion with her pig. Okja is taken to a laboratory where she is forcibly bred with another super pig, and flesh is taken from her for a taste test. After the ALF sees the footage, K reveals that he lied to the rest of the group about Mija's support of the plan. Jay beats K and expels him from the ALF while promising to return his equipment when they are done with it. In New York, Mija has to comply with the Mirando Corp. Jay slips into her room and tells her they plan to rescue Okja while on stage. During the Mirando parade, a battered and temporarily blinded Okja attacks Mija. Jay tries to hurt Okja to protect the girl, but Mija doesn't let him and calms Okja down. The ALF shows Okja's mistreatment to the public, who quickly turn against Mirando. Lucy surrenders the company to her twin sister Nancy who contacts a private security firm Black Chalk to take out the ALF members. Okja is recaptured and the ALF members are arrested, except for Mija and Jay, who are rescued by a remorseful K. Nancy starts full production at the slaughterhouse. K, Mija, and Jay travel to a processing plant in search of Okja, and find her being forced up a ramp into a slaughterhouse. On the verge of being slaughtered, Mija shows a Mirando employee a photo of herself with baby Okja, prompting him to stop. Nancy arrives and Mija speaks her first English dialogue by offering the gold pig in exchange for Okja's life. Although initially reluctant, Nancy agrees as she deemed it a good business deal, having Jay and K arrested by Black Chalk. As Mija and Okja are escorted away, a pair of super pigs push their newborn through the electric fence to Okja to hide and rescue from the farm. Back in the countryside, Mija resumes her life with her grandfather, Okja, and the new piglet. She then joins her grandfather for dinner as Okja looks on. In a post-credits scene, Jay is released from prison, boarding a bus with K and the other members of the organization.

    "Synopsis": "Misako (Ayame Misaki) creates movie audio descriptions. Her scripts consist of intensive descriptions of the settings on the screen in an attempt to make them as accessible as possible to blind audiences. With her supervisors, she and her company test a script (for a film we are later told is deeply moving) on a focus group of 10 blind people. At one of the pre-premiere screenings, she meets Masaya (Masatoshi Nagase), a renowned photographer who is without the majority of his sight, which does not allow him to practice his craft outside of a handful of images with which he is aware of what he will capture (i.e., the setting sun, Misako herself). Masaya's strong character makes him the only one to firmly criticize her scripts. He helps Masako see the coldness of her careful descriptions and spurs others to share their critiques. Despite the differences that arise between them, and Misako's own lashing out at Masaya at one of these focus groups when he expresses further disdain at her newly updated script, both manage to create a strong relationship that allows them to explore a world previously invisible to their eyes. Both appear at the grand premiere showing of the film with Misako's script, however, in the wake of their argument, Misako's colleague has finished the script, and it is his voice we hear in the overlay for the film. Many in the audience are moved to tears by the film's audio description. In the last scene of the film, Masaya struggles to climb a small dune. At the top, he stops to face the setting sun.",

    "Synopsis": "Auguste Rodin has become among the most celebrated sculptors in the world at the turn of the century and continues to win commissions for major sculptures such as Monument to Balzac, The Kiss, The Burghers of Calais, and The Gates of Hell. His career has progressed to the point where he keeps a major studio operating with multiple students and many models constantly in the studio as he progresses on his current projects. Though a significant success artistically, Rodin's personal life has suffered setbacks. His relationship with his wife has become colder over the years and Rodin takes up a relationship with a younger female sculptor who fills an emotional emptiness which he experiences with his wife. Rodin goes to visit Honore Balzac to discuss making a life-size sculpture of the prominent French author. His original conception is to see the author as a primal literary figure whom he envisions as standing in a heroic posture and in the nude. As his conceptual drawings for the sculpture progress, Rodin then takes up the preliminary design of the molding structures which will support the sculpture which will grow to its full size as it progresses toward completion. Rodin does not have the benefit of Balzac as a live model for the sculpture and relies on a pregnant model posing in the nude in the heroic pose which Rodin wished to use for the sculpture. Rodin uses the increased mass of the pregnancy to mimick the somewhat oversized girth which Balzac's overweight figure obtained in older age. Meanwhile, his female sculpture assistant, Camille Claudel, confronts him about the prospects of their relationship which has become explicitly intimate, and Rodin tells her that she occupies an unrivaled place in his affections. She confronts him in order for him to sign a paper stating his intentions to leave his wife and marry her which Rodin agrees to do and signs before her eyes. Rodin's wife is conscious of the fact that her husband is less than faithful and that their relationship has grown colder with the years and with her rapidly diminishing attractiveness and loss of youth. Rodin is uncommunicative about the issue and feels that he should live as if in an open marriage. He continues his relationship with the female sculptor and his wife begins to gather information about his mistress apparently with a mind to confronting her about the realities of Rodin's personal life and family. When the Balzac statue reaches its subsequent stages of completion, Rodin calls the commissioning parties to do a preliminary review of the statue. Their response is unanimously negative and stark in its disapproval. Before them they see an oversized and almost grotesquely obese version of the celebrated French author. The commissioning parties are especially disturbed by the prominently featured male organs which Rodin spent special effort to prominently display. There is no question left in the mind of the reviewers that the statue is to be fully rejected as both poorly conceived by Balzac and poorly executed. Balzac is deeply disturbed by the review though he remains silent through much of the criticism. His wife has discovered the address of where Balzac's female sculptor friend is staying and goes to confront her. The meeting sours very quickly with verbal animosity overcoming both the wife and the mistress as they try to face each other down. They part company in a high state of distress, and Rodin's mistress then later confronts Rodin about his promises to her about starting a new life with her and leaving his wife. Rodin contemplates for a further moment and states that an ultimatum at this time does not work him or for his career and he decides that they must part ways. Although Rodin remains profligate in his sexual openness with his other models, he still nonetheless at least partially reconciles with his wife and the two continue to make their home together. Rodin's contemplation about the Balzac statue has been ponderous and one day in his studio he gets help from one of his students to immerse an oversized men's overcoat into a clay bath in order to fully drench it in the wet composite of clay in order to prepare its application. Rodin decides that he will apply the wet clay overcoat by draping over the shoulders of the nude Balzac statue, thereby covering the original nudity of the preliminary pose of the statue and fully covering over the nude male organs which had offended the commissioning parties at the time of the first review. He allows the draped coat to dry and the completed statue takes its final form which he keeps in his country garden in his home outside of town away from his studio. As the film ends, the statue is seen years later in Japan where it is displayed in the Museum of the Open Air (Hakone Open-Air Museum) for the public to contemplate and admire.",

    "Synopsis": "Martha Farnsworth runs a girls' school in Virginia during the American Civil War. By 1864, almost all of the students, teachers, and slaves have left. In addition to Farnsworth herself, only five students and one teacher, Edwina Morrow, remain. In the woods, the youngest student, Amy, comes across John McBurney, a corporal in the Union Army who was wounded in the leg during battle, and has since deserted. At the school, Farnsworth tends to his wounds and all the women and girls are fascinated by the handsome man. Initially, some of the school's residents want McBurney to be delivered as a prisoner of war to the Confederate Army, but Farnsworth decides that they will let his leg heal before they decide, ostensibly to be a good Christian. When Confederate soldiers arrive at the school, Farnsworth does not tell them that a Union soldier is on the premises. While McBurney is recovering, the women and girls subtly vie for his affection by giving him presents, wearing jewelry, and preparing a lavish dinner for him. He returns their affection, which Farnsworth deduces is an attempt to win their favor and not be turned over to either army. When he is able to move again, he begins to help in the garden. When Miss Farnsworth indicates that McBurney is healthy now and will have to leave the school in a few days, he tries to convince her to let him stay as a gardener, to no avail. Accepting his fate, he tells Edwina that he has fallen in love with her. That night, however, she finds him in bed with Alicia, the rebellious eldest pupil. McBurney tries to appease Edwina, but she pushes him away, causing him to fall down the stairs, badly breaking his already injured leg and falling unconscious. Alicia spares Edwina by claiming McBurney forced himself onto her. Farnsworth decides that the only way to save his life is to amputate his leg. When he awakens days later and discovers he's lost his leg, McBurney is devastated and furious, accusing the women of doing so in revenge for him choosing Alicia over them. He is locked inside, but threatens Alicia into giving him the key. He breaks out, steals Farnsworth's gun, and threatens the women before storming off. When Farnsworth sends Amy to the gate to signal McBurney's presence to Confederate troops, he pursues her at gunpoint to a shed, where Farnsworth rescues her by talking him down. After McBurney storms out, Farnsworth and the students settle on killing McBurney by preparing him a dinner containing poisonous mushrooms. Edwina follows McBurney to his room, where she initiates sex. During the dinner, Edwina is unaware of the plan, and McBurney falls dead after eating the mushrooms. While the students sew McBurney's body into a shroud, Edwina is devastated. The women drag McBurney's body to the road and attach the signal to the gate so that he will be found by the next Confederate soldiers who pass by.",

    "Synopsis": "After performing an open heart surgery, Steven Murphy, a cardiothoracic surgeon in Cincinnati, goes to a diner where he meets 16-year-old Martin Lang, whose father died a few years earlier. Steven goes home to his wife Anna and their children Kim and Bob. Steven invites Martin to meet his family, and Martin gets along with everyone, especially Kim. That night, Martin invites Steven to his house for dinner the next day. At Martin’s house, after dinner, Martin goes to bed, leaving Steven alone with his mother. Martin’s mother begins flirting with Steven and he leaves. Martin visits Steven's office, complaining of chest pain, but tests show nothing wrong. Martin invites Steven over again, saying his mother finds Steven attractive, but Steven refuses. Afterward, Martin's demands for Steven's attention grow increasingly frequent and desperate. Steven is troubled to learn that Martin gave Kim a ride home on his motorcycle. One morning, Steven's son Bob is unable to move his legs, so Steven and Anna rush him to the hospital, where numerous tests are performed. Martin tells Steven that, to \"balance things\" for his father, who died while Steven was operating on him, Steven must kill a member of his own family. Otherwise, within a few days, Steven's family will all die from paralysis, an inability to eat, and bleeding from the eyes. Steven has Martin escorted from the hospital. Later, Bob begins refusing to eat, but no cause can be found. Kim, who has fallen in love with Martin, collapses while singing in the choir and is also hospitalized. She chokes on a piece of apple and is also unable to eat. Kim and Bob are given feeding tubes. Steven tells Anna of his history with Martin. He also admits to drinking before operating on Martin's father. Martin calls Kim with Anna watching and tells Kim to stand up and walk, which she does. When he hangs up, she collapses again. Anna confronts Martin about forcing her children to suffer. Martin replies it is justice to him since he believes Steven killed his father. Kim and Bob are sent home. After Anna chastises Steven for his passive way of dealing with the situation, Steven ties Martin up in his basement. He beats Martin and shoots him in the leg, but Martin is not intimidated. Martin bites Steven's arm as well as his own arm to demonstrate his point. The children argue over whom their father will kill and try to curry his favor. Steven asks the school principal which of his children is \"best,\" but he says it is impossible to point out the best. Back home, Anna takes the children to see Martin, tends to his wounds, and kisses his feet, but she fails to elicit any sympathy. She then tells Steven that he should kill one of the children, not her, because she can have another child. Kim fails to persuade Martin to heal her so they can run away together and then tells Steven how much she loves her family and offers her life to save theirs. Finally, hopeless, Anna releases Martin. When Bob begins bleeding from his eyes, which Martin said would happen a few hours before death, Steven places him, Kim, and Anna in a circle, bound with duct tape, and covers their heads. Steven pulls a woolen hat over his face, spins around, and repeatedly fires a rifle. He narrowly misses Kim and Anna, but the third shot kills Bob. Some time later, Martin, his face still somewhat bruised, enters the diner where he and Steven used to meet. The remaining Murphys are inside and promptly leave. Martin watches as they go. Steven avoids his gaze, Anna shoots him an icy glare, and Kim, who is healed and able to walk again, glances back before walking out of the door.",

    "film_title": "The Meyerowitz Stories",
    "Synopsis": "After separating from his wife, unemployed Danny Meyerowitz moves in with his father, Harold, a retired Bard College art professor and sculptor, and his fourth wife, Maureen, a pleasant but foggy hippie. Jean is his sister, and they have a younger half-brother, Matthew. Danny is close to his daughter, Eliza, a freshman film student at Bard. Eliza sends one of her sexually provocative films to the family, discomforting them. Some of Harold's work has been selected as part of a faculty group show at Bard, but he refuses to be part of a group show. Danny and Harold attend the MoMA retrospective of a friend and contemporary of Harold's, the successful L.J. Shapiro. There, neither father nor son feels comfortable; Harold feels that the art world has forgotten him, and chooses to literally run away down the street. Danny meets Shapiro's daughter, single mother Loretta, but is forced to leave to chase after Harold. Harold's younger son, Matthew, a successful financial advisor to rock stars on the West Coast in Los Angeles, is in New York on business, and meets Harold for lunch with an accountant friend. Matthew discusses raising his young son after separating from his wife, neither of whom Harold know. They try to convince Harold to sell his Manhattan home and its sculpture. Harold tells them that the decision to sell the house is a private family decision, and stalks out. At a third restaurant, he criticizes the prices, but orders lavishly when Matthew says he will pay. During lunch at the restaurant, Harold feels offended by the arrogant manner of another patron, and gets Matthew to chase him when he alleges that the patron swapped jackets with him. Although mistaken, father and son bond slightly in self-righteous indignation. That evening, they pay a visit to Matthew's mother and Harold's second wife, Julia, who has since married a man named Cody, a wealthy philistine. She tells them that she is sorry that she was not a better mother to Danny and Jean; her directness makes them uncomfortable, and they are eager to leave. Matthew resents Harold for preferring a life of art over money. \"I beat you!\", he screams at his father's departing Volvo. Harold is diagnosed with a chronic subdural hematoma. He enters the hospital, where, as the days pass, his children learn to manage his care, after first leaning on Harold's doctor and nurse to do it. Matthew and Maureen agree to sell the house that the latter grew up in without consulting anyone else in the family. Outside the hospital, Jean tells her brothers that Harold's friend Paul, who happens to be visiting at the moment, exposed himself and masturbated in front of her when she was a teenager. Upset with the revelation, Matthew and Danny damage Paul's car with mounting exhilaration. Jean expresses her disappointment in her brothers, having wanted someone to just listen to her instead of doing such damage without her consent. At Bard, representing their father at the faculty group show, Matthew and Danny argue over Eliza drinking alcohol, which turns into a fight about Harold's favoritism of Matthew and Matthew's estrangement from the rest of the family. Later, bloody and crying, Matthew ends up breaking down emotionally during his speech as he realizes he'll never achieve closure with Harold if he dies now. Danny undergoes surgery for his persistent limp, something his daughter and siblings had urged him to seek treatment for. As Harold convalesces at Maureen's place in the country (the townhouse was sold, despite Matthew's change of heart), it dawns on Matthew and Harold that Harold's favorite sculpture, titled \"Matthew\", a lifelong object of resentment for Danny and Jean, was likely based on his feelings for young Danny. Danny, who until now has been solicitous toward his father, refuses to care for him while Maureen is away, and accepts his brother's offer of a trip to California, but he forgives him for his failures as a dad. On the way to the flight, he meets Loretta, now single, and she suggests that they go together to the screening of a film that Eliza has made. In the basement of The Whitney, Eliza uncovers her grandfather's sculpture, long believed to have been lost.",

    "Synopsis": "200px|thumb|The Square is presented as a simple outline. Christian is the curator of the X-Royal art museum in Stockholm, formerly the Royal Palace. He is interviewed by journalist Anne, struggling to explain museum parlance. Later, Christian is pulled into a confrontation at a pedestrian zone, after which he notices that his smartphone and wallet are missing, along with his cufflinks, presumably stolen in a confidence trick. Christian is able to track the position of his phone on his computer, which he and his assistant Michael trace to a large apartment block. They write a threatening anonymous letter demanding the return of the phone and wallet by depositing them at a nearby 7-Eleven. Christian puts a copy of the letter through each apartment mailbox that night. Several days later, a package for him is deposited at the store, containing the phone and the completely untouched wallet. Euphoric after the success of his plan, Christian goes to a party where he meets Anne again, before ending up in her apartment. After the two have sex, Anne offers to throw away a used condom but he steadfastly refuses to hand it over to her. They argue over the situation, as she believes he does not trust her to dispose of the semen rather than take it. Several days later, Anne meets Christian in the museum and states she is looking for more than casual sex. She asks him if he feels the same, but Christian is evasive. When Anne later tries to call him, he does not pick up the phone. The day after picking up the package, Christian is informed that a second one has arrived for him at the 7-Eleven. Suspicious, he sends Michael to pick it up. In the store, Michael is confronted by a young Arab boy who states that his parents believe that he is a thief because of the letter and demands that Christian apologizes to him and his family. Otherwise, the boy threatens to create \"chaos\" for him. Later, the boy visits Christian's home and confronts him, along with his two young daughters, on the staircase. Christian tries to send him away but the boy begins to knock on doors and screaming for help. In a fit of frustration, Christian pushes the boy down the stairs, though no one comes to his aid. Disturbed, Christian desperately searches the trash outside the house for a note which contains the boy's phone number. After finding it and unsuccessfully trying to call him, Christian records an apologetic video message. In the midst of these troubles, Christian has to manage the promotion of a new exhibition centered on an art piece called The Square by Lola Arias, which is described in the artist's statement: \"The Square is a sanctuary of trust and caring. Within it we all share equal rights and obligations.\" The advertising agency commissioned by the museum to promote The Square states that they need to harness social media attention with something other than the uncontroversial and bland artist's statement. Advertising agency representatives consider a depiction of violence contradicting The Square s message, developing a promotional clip showing an impoverished girl entering The Square and being killed in an explosion. The video is published on the museum's website and YouTube channel after a distracted Christian gives his approval without viewing it. The clip goes viral, quickly reaching 300,000 YouTube views, but receives an extremely hostile response from the media, religious leaders and the general public. The museum arranges a press conference, where Christian states he violated protocol and is stepping down as curator in mutual agreement with the board. Several journalists then attack him for stirring up cheap controversy with a tasteless clip, while others attack him for self-censorship because of his resignation. Feeling guilty about wronging the boy, Christian drives to the apartment block several days later and tries to find him and his family. Christian talks to a neighbour who states that he knew the boy but that his family has moved away.",

He cares for his elderly mother in his childhood home in New York City. Joe has flashbacks of the abuse he and his mother faced from his violent father, and his brutal past in the military and FBI, and is troubled by suicidal thoughts. As he comes home one night, Joe is seen by Moises, the son of Angel, who acts as middleman between Joe and his handler, John McCleary. Joe tells McCleary that Angel knows his address and may pose a security risk. McCleary assigns Joe a new job from Albert Votto, a New York State Senator. Votto has offered a large sum of money to discreetly rescue his abducted daughter, Nina. He gives Joe the address of a brothel for wealthy patrons sent via an anonymous text. Joe stakes out the brothel, kills several security guards and patrons, and rescues Nina. While Joe and Nina await Votto's arrival in a hotel room, the news reports that Votto has committed suicide. Police officers gain access to the room with the help of the desk clerk, kill the clerk, and take Nina. Joe escapes after killing an officer sent to kill him. Joe finds that government agents killed McCleary, Angel, and Moises while searching for Joe's address. Arriving back at his home, Joe discovers that two agents have murdered his mother and have been waiting for him. He kills one agent and mortally wounds the other. As the agent is dying, he reveals that Votto and Governor Williams are pedophiles and child traffickers and that Nina is Williams's favorite. He explains that Williams is directing the authorities to cover up the trafficking. Joe drives to a lake in a forest to give his mother a water burial and fills his pockets with stones, with the intent of killing himself. As he sinks, he has a vision of Nina. Removing the stones from his pockets, he swims back to the surface. Joe follows Williams to his country home and fights his way in, only to discover Williams with his throat slit. He searches the house and discovers Nina, who is seated at a dining room table, alongside a bloody straight razor. Although Joe has become increasingly upset, Nina reassures him that she is alright. The two go to a diner to discuss their future. Joe has a violent suicidal fantasy and passes out. Nina wakes him, saying, \"It's a beautiful day.\" He agrees, and they leave together.",

Shahzad, like Jafari, was a famous real-life Iranian actress; she was ostracised after the Iranian Revolution, following years of mistreatment by male directors.",

    "Synopsis": "Asako, a young woman who lives in Osaka, experiences love at first sight when she encounters Baku. The two begin a whirlwind relationship against the advice from Asako's friend, who only believes Baku will hurt her. After spending the night at Baku's place, Asako awakens to find him missing. It's explained that Baku suddenly disappears from time to time and it's been that way since his father died. Baku returns to Asako's avail, and they embrace. Baku tells Asako that he will always return to her. A voice-over explains that Baku suddenly disappears once again, and they lose touch with each other. Two years later, Asako is living in Tokyo and works at a coffee shop. She encounters a businessman named Ryohei, who works at a nearby Japanese sake company. He is nearly identical to Baku in physical appearance, and Asako believes it is him at first and even verbally greets him with Baku's name. Only after some tentative verbal exchange does Asako accept that it is not Baku but another young man. Ryohei doesn't understand why Asako treats him oddly and with tentativeness. It isn't until one night when he unexpectedly helps her friend get into an art show, that he begins to learn more about Asako. As they stop for coffee after the show, Asako excuses herself suddenly to depart, and her friend then suggests that he invite one of his friends to come visit for dinner and to bring a blind date for her, so that Ryohei can meet with Asako again. Ryohei is sufficiently taken with Asako that he finds a friend to invite for the dinner and discovers that Asako's friend is currently playing a part in Chekhov's The Sea Gull. Ryohei's friend and Asako's friend seem to quarrel about the best way to act the parts in Chekhov's play, though they eventually stop quarrelling and the four have dinner together. After the evening is over, Ryohei continues to try to win Asako over and eventually succeeds. Five years later, Asako and Ryohei are living together happily. One day, Asako learns that Baku has become a famous actor and model. She musters the courage to tell Ryohei about how her initial romantic interest in him was due to his resemblance to Baku, and he gracefully accepts her confession, allowing her to find closure. However, Baku suddenly shows up at her apartment and announces his return the next day. On the same evening, Baku appears at a restaurant where Asako and Ryohei's friends are celebrating their engagement and asks Asako to leave Ryohei in the middle of dinner. Asako discovers that her feelings to Baku are still unresolved and starkly leaves with him, upsetting Ryohei. They travel north together to stay at Baku's parents' home which is currently uninhabited for the season, but, during the trip, Asako realizes she was superficial for choosing him over Ryohei. In the end, Asako returns to Ryohei, but he rejects her company. Both of them come to the conclusion that Asako has hurt Ryohei to the point that he may never be able to trust her again, and she accepts this as a consequence to their relationship.",

    "Synopsis": "In 2001, Qiao and her boyfriend Bin, a mob boss, have a lot of power in Datong, an old mining city that has become poor since the coal prices dropped. After Bin's boss is murdered, Qiao suggests they run away from everything and get married, but Bin is not interested. One night a group of motorcyclists attack Bin and his driver, claiming to dethrone him. Qiao grabs Bin's handgun and fires two warning shots into the air, scaring off the attackers. The police tell Qiao that the gun is illegally owned and asks her whose it is; she repeatedly claims it is hers. She spends five years in prison for possessing an illegal firearm but Bin does not visit her during that time. After Qiao is released, she tries to call him but can never seem to get in touch. She travels by boat to the city in Hubei province where Bin is living but is instead greeted by Bin's new girlfriend—meanwhile, Bin hides in another room. Qiao says that if he wants to break up with her, he will have to tell her himself. She has almost no money to her name so she cons a few strangers for money and food. She hires a motorcycle driver to take her to the power plant where she thinks that Bin works, and along the way the driver suggests that they have sex. She uses this opportunity to steal his bike, and when she gets to the power plant she reports to a police officer that the driver tried to rape her and that he should call her boyfriend Bin. This finally forces Bin to see her. In a hotel room, Bin says he's a changed man, no longer a \"jianghu\" gangster, and has no place in his life for Qiao anymore. He can never go back to Datong because he has lost all the respect he once had there. Qiao says that she saved his life and took the blame for him: he should have been waiting for her the day she got out of prison. Since he refuses to say it, she finally says that their relationship is over and he leaves. On a train back to Datong, she meets a passenger who claims to be developing a UFO-hunting tourism company and invites her to join him after she claims to have seen one herself. But after they transfer onto another train, he admits that it was all a lie. She gets off the train, sees a bright object fly swiftly overhead, and makes her way back to Datong. In 2017, Qiao gets a call from Bin, and when she picks him up, finds him using a wheelchair. She brings him back to their old gambling parlor where she now works and many of his old friends are happy to see him. He is closed-off and hot-tempered, immediately starting fights, and Qiao nearly throws him out. He tells her that he had a stroke from drinking too much and she finds a doctor to help rehabilitate him. When he can walk again, he sneaks out of Qiao's building with just a brief voicemail to say he has left. Qiao goes to the front door when she learns he has gone but she cannot see him.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1972, Ron Stallworth is hired as the first black officer in the Colorado Springs Police Department. Assigned to work in the records room, he tires of being bullied and applies to be an undercover officer. He is assigned to infiltrate a local rally where national civil rights leader Kwame Ture (a.k.a. Stokely Carmichael) is speaking. At the rally, Stallworth meets Patrice Dumas, president of the Black Student Union at Colorado College. While taking Ture to his hotel, Patrice is stopped by patrolman Andy Landers, a racist officer in Stallworth's precinct, who threatens Ture and gropes Patrice. Following the rally, Stallworth is reassigned to the intelligence division. After reading about a local division of the Ku Klux Klan in the newspaper, he calls posing as a white man. He speaks with Walter Breachway, the president of the Colorado Springs chapter, but soon realizes that not only did he use his real name, but he must also meet the Klan members. Stallworth recruits his Jewish coworker, Flip Zimmerman, to impersonate him and meet the KKK members while he continues posing as white on the phone. Under Stallworth's identity, Zimmerman meets Breachway, the slightly more reckless and unstable Felix Kendrickson (and later his wife Connie), and Ivanhoe, who cryptically refers to an upcoming terrorist attack. Calling Ku Klux Klan headquarters in Louisiana to expedite his membership, Stallworth begins regular phone conversations with Grand Wizard David Duke. Kendrickson suspects Zimmerman of being Jewish and tries to force him to take a polygraph test at gunpoint, but Stallworth, overhearing everything on the wire Zimmerman is wearing, breaks the Kendricksons' kitchen window as a distraction. Stallworth begins dating Patrice without telling her that he is a police officer. After passing information to the Army CID about active-duty members, he learns from an FBI agent that two members are personnel stationed at NORAD, a critical, high-security defense facility. Duke visits Colorado Springs for Stallworth's induction into the Klan. Over the real Stallworth's protests, the detective is assigned to a protection detail for Duke. Once Zimmerman, masquerading as Stallworth, is initiated, Connie Kendrickson leaves the ceremony to place an explosive device at a local civil rights rally. The real Stallworth realizes her intentions and alerts local police officers. When Connie notices a heavy police presence at the rally, she puts Felix's backup plan into action and plants the device at Dumas's house, leaving it under her car when it will not fit into the mailbox. Stallworth tackles her as she tries to flee, but uniformed officers detain and beat him despite his protests that he is working undercover. The bombmaker, Walker, had recognized Zimmerman from a prior arrest and informed Felix at the Klan reception. He, Felix, and Ivanhoe drive to Dumas's house and park next to her car without realizing that the device is hidden underneath. When they detonate it, the explosion kills all three. Zimmerman arrives, frees Stallworth, and arrests Connie. While Stallworth is celebrating the closed case that night with Patrice, Landers arrives and drunkenly harasses the two, remorselessly admitting to his assault on Patrice. Stallworth reveals he is wearing a wire, and Police Chief Bridges arrives and arrests Landers for police brutality. Bridges congratulates the team for their success but orders them to end their investigation and destroy the records. Stallworth receives a call from Duke, and he insultingly tells Duke he is black before hanging up. Later while Dumas and Stallworth discuss their future, they are interrupted by a knock on the door. Through the window in the hallway, they see a flaming cross on a hillside surrounded by KKK members. The film cuts to footage of the 2017 Unite the Right rally, the hit and run attack that killed and injured counter-protesters, part of a speech by David Duke, and comments by President Donald Trump. It ends with a dedication to Heather Heyer (who was killed in the attack) and lastly, shows an upside-down American flag fading to a black-and-white American flag, before fading to black.",

    "Synopsis": "Lee Jong-su, an aspiring young novelist, performs odd jobs in Seoul. One day he runs into Shin Hae-mi, a childhood neighbor and classmate, at a promotion at which he is making a delivery. Jong-su initially does not remember her, but Hae-mi tells him she had plastic surgery. Jong-su gives her the pink watch that he won at the promotion. Later, she tells him about her upcoming trip to Africa and asks him to feed her cat, Boil, while she is away. Before Hae-mi's departure, Jong-su's father, a cattle farmer in Paju, becomes entangled in disagreeable legal affairs, and Jong-su has to return to the farm. Jong-su visits Hae-mi's apartment, where he receives instructions about feeding the cat. They then have sex. After Hae-mi departs, Jong-su dutifully feeds her cat, although he never sees it. He does, however, presume that a cat is there because he finds feces in the litter box. He begins habitually masturbating in Hae-mi's apartment. One day Hae-mi calls, saying she had become stranded at Nairobi Airport for three days after a bombing nearby. When Jong-su comes to pick her up, she arrives with Ben, a man whom she met and bonded with during the crisis. The three go out for dinner, where Hae-mi cries and confesses that she wants to disappear. Ben is wealthy, but does not give a clear answer when asked what kind of work he does. At Jong-su's farm, the trio smokes cannabis and Hae-mi dances topless. After Hae-mi has fallen asleep on the sofa, Ben confesses that every two months, he burns an abandoned greenhouse as a hobby. He notes that Jong-su's rural neighborhood is full of greenhouses. When asked when his next burning will take place, Ben claims it will be very soon and close to Jong-su's house. Jong-su chastises Hae-mi for disrobing in front of other men. She quietly gets into Ben's car and they drive off. Jong-su keeps watch around the neighborhood to see if any greenhouses burn down, but none do. One afternoon, in front of an intact greenhouse that he is inspecting, he receives a call from Hae-mi, which cuts off after a few seconds of ambiguous noises. Jong-su becomes worried as she does not answer any of his calls, and begins to investigate after her phone number becomes disconnected. He convinces the landlady to let him into Hae-mi's apartment so that he can feed her cat. Hae-mi's apartment is unnaturally clean; her suitcase remains, and all signs of the cat are gone. Jong-su begins staking out Ben's Gangnam apartment and following him to see where he goes. When he sees Ben's Porsche parked outside a restaurant, he goes inside to confront him. Ben insists that he did burn down a greenhouse near Jong-su's house. A young woman approaches the table, apologizing to Ben for being late. As the three of them leave the restaurant, Jong-su asks Ben if he has heard from Hae-mi and whether she has gone on a trip. Ben says he has not heard from her, and he doubts she has gone on a trip because she could not afford it. Ben says Jong-su was the only person she trusted and that it made him jealous for the first time in his life. One day, Ben finds Jong-su waiting outside his place and invites him up to his apartment. Ben has a new cat, which he claims is a rescued stray. In the restroom, Jong-su finds a pink watch, similar to the one he gave Hae-mi, hidden in a drawer containing other pieces of women's jewelry. When Ben's cat runs out of the apartment, Jong-su finds that it answers to the name \"Boil.\" Jong-su silently leaves the dinner party Ben is hosting, despite Ben's pleas for him to stay. Jong-su asks to meet Ben in the countryside, claiming he is with Hae-mi. Ben sees that Hae-mi is not there and asks Jong-su where she is; Jong-su stabs him to death. He then douses Ben's car and body in gasoline and sets them on fire, tossing his blood-soaked clothes in as well. He stumbles naked to his truck and drives off.",

    "Synopsis": "Zain El Hajj, a 12-year-old from the slums of Beirut, is serving a five-year prison sentence in Roumieh Prison for stabbing someone whom he refers to as a \"son of a bitch\". Neither Zain nor his parents know his exact date of birth as they never applied/received an official birth certificate. Zain is brought before a court, having decided to take civil action against his parents, his mother, Souad, and his father, Selim. When asked by the judge why he wants to sue his parents, Zain answers \"Because I was born\" (or, more precisely, \"because you had me\"). Meanwhile, Lebanese authorities process a group of migrant workers, including a young Ethiopian woman named Rahil. The story then flashes back several months to before Zain was arrested. Zain lives with his parents and takes care of at least seven younger siblings who make money in various schemes instead of going to school. He uses forged prescriptions to purchase tramadol pills from multiple pharmacies, which they crush into powder and soak them into clothes, which his brother sells to drug addicts in prison. Zain also works as a delivery boy for Assad, the family's landlord, and the owner of a local market stall. One morning, Zain helps his 11-year-old sister Sahar to hide the evidence of her first period, fearing she will be married to Assad if her parents discover that she can now become pregnant. thumb|left|The entrance to Luna Park, [[Ras Beirut, where Zain meets Rahil]] Zain makes plans to escape with Sahar and begin a new life. However, his suspicions are proven correct as her parents marry off Sahar to Assad in exchange for two chickens. Furious at his parents, Zain runs away and catches a bus, where he meets an elderly man dressed in a knock-off Spider-Man costume who calls himself \"Cockroach Man\". Cockroach Man gets off the bus at the Luna Park in Ras Beirut and Zain follows him, spending the rest of the day at the park. While on the Ferris wheel, Zain sees a beautiful sunset and begins to cry. Later, Zain meets Rahil, an Ethiopian migrant worker who is working as a cleaner at the park. She takes pity on Zain and agrees to let him live with her at her tin shack in exchange for Zain babysitting her undocumented infant son Yonas when she is at work. Rahil's forged migrant documents are due to expire soon, and she does not have enough money to pay her forger Aspro for new documents. Aspro offers to forge the documents for free if she gives Yonas to him so that Yonas can be adopted. Rahil refuses, despite Aspro's claims that Yonas' undocumented status will mean he can never receive an education or be employed. Rahil's documents expire and she is arrested by Lebanese authorities. After she does not return to the shack, Zain panics. Several days pass, and Zain begins looking after Yonas on his own, claiming that they are brothers, and begins selling tramadol again to earn money. One day, while at Souk Al Ahad, where Aspro is based, Zain meets a young girl named Maysoun. Maysoun is a Syrian refugee and claims that Aspro has agreed to send her to Sweden. Zain demands that Aspro send him to Sweden as well, which Aspro agrees to do if Zain gives him Yonas. After the landlord has locked him out of Rahil's house where all his money and things are, Zain reluctantly agrees and leaves Yonas with him. Aspro tells him that he will need some form of identification to become a refugee. Zain returns to his parents and demands they give him his identification, to which they laughingly tell him he does not have any. Having disowned him for leaving, they kick him out of their house, but not before revealing that Sahar had recently died due to difficulties with her pregnancy. Furious, Zain takes a large knife, runs out the house and stabs Assad. Zain is arrested and sentenced to five years at Roumieh Prison. While in prison, during a visit from his mother, Zain learns that Souad is pregnant yet again and plans to name the child Sahar. Disgusted by his mother's lack of remorse for his sister's death, he tells her not to visit again, calling her \"heartless\". During a TV show requesting call-in commentary on child abuse, Zain contacts the media and says that he is tired of parents neglecting their children and plans to sue his own parents for continuing to have children when they cannot take care of them. When the judge asks him what he wants from his parents, he says \"I want them to stop having children\", as he does not want the rest of his surviving siblings or any other children that his parents may have in the future to suffer the same neglect and abuse that he and Sahar both endured. Zain also alleges that Aspro is adopting children illegally and mistreating them; the court then rules in Zain's favor, with Zain winning the case and gaining justice for Sahar's death. Aspro's house is raided and the children and parents are reunited, including Yonas and Rahil. Zain's photo is taken for his ID card. The photographer cracks a joke at Zain's sour disposition—\"It's your ID card, not your death certificate\"—and Zain manages a smile.",

    "Synopsis": "In post-World War II Poland, director and composer Wiktor, manager Kaczmarek, and choreographer Irena are holding auditions for a state-sponsored folk music ensemble. Wiktor's attention is immediately captured by Zula, an ambitious and captivating young woman who is faking a peasant identity and is on probation after attacking her abusive father. Wiktor and Zula quickly develop a strong, obsessive attraction and have sex after a performance. Wiktor and Irena are pressured by bureaucrats to include pro-Communist and pro-Stalinist propaganda in their performances—in exchange, the troupe would be allowed to tour the Eastern Bloc. Wiktor and Irena oppose this, but the career-driven, opportunistic Kaczmarek agrees, and a resentful Irena quits. Kaczmarek is also interested in Zula and pressures her into spying on Wiktor for him, but Zula does not reveal any incriminating information. When the ensemble visits East Berlin, Wiktor plans to flee to the West with Zula, and the two affirm their love and passion. Zula fails to come to the rendezvous with Wiktor, and he crosses the border alone. Years later, Zula meets Wiktor in Paris, where he is working at a jazz club. They both have other partners, but their continued mutual attraction is clear. When Wiktor asks Zula why she failed to appear with him to cross the border, she says that she lacked confidence in herself. A year later, Wiktor attends one of the troupe's performances in Yugoslavia, where Zula spots him in the audience and becomes visibly shaken. Two years later, Wiktor is working as a film score composer in Paris, where Zula reunites with him. She has married another man to obtain a visa so that she could travel to Paris and be with Wiktor. Wiktor attempts to build a singing career for Zula. He embellishes her backstory to make her more interesting to film producer Michel, which annoys Zula. Zula becomes jealous of Wiktor's past lovers, and as work on her record strains their relationship, she begins to drink heavily and misbehave in public. Wiktor and Zula finish Zula's record, but a disappointed Zula remains frustrated and unhappy. She reveals that she had an affair with Michel and insults Wiktor, and he strikes her. She later disappears, and Wiktor confronts Michel, who states she has returned to Poland. Against the advice of a Polish embassy official in Paris, Wiktor returns to Poland. Zula meets with him at a work camp, where he reveals that he has been sentenced to a \"generous\" 15 years of hard labor on charges of defecting and espionage; his hand is visibly disfigured. Zula bribes a guard for time alone with him, and promises to free him. Five years later, a freed Wiktor meets with Kaczmarek at a club where Zula, now a barely-functioning alcoholic, is performing. Zula arranged for an early release for Wiktor by agreeing to marry Kaczmarek, and now has a 4 year old son; Kaczmarek is unsure his son looks like him. Wiktor and Zula escape to a bathroom together, where a miserable and defeated Zula begs Wiktor to rescue her. The two take a bus to an abandoned church seen at the beginning of the film, where they exchange marriage vows and seemingly prepare to commit suicide together. After ingesting pills, the couple is seen sitting outside, observing the landscape. Zula suggests they view it \"from the other side,\" and the two stand and depart from view, as wheat fields sway in the wind.",

    "Synopsis": "Marcello is a small, mild man, living in a dilapidated beach settlement in Castel Volturno; he owns a dog grooming shop, and divides his days between his work, his daughter, Alida - who lives with her mother, from whom he is separated - and socialising with other locals. He supplements his meager income by selling cocaine to acquaintances. One is Simone, a huge and thuggish former boxer who terrorises the neighborhood. The extent of this abusive friendship is demonstrated when one night, Simone forces Marcello to take part a burglary, since he has a van and can act as the driver. The job runs smoothly, but Marcello hears his accomplice describe how he put a Chihuahua in the freezer to make it stop barking. After receiving his token share of the loot, Marcello returns to the scene, retrieves the dog, and revives it. Simone continues to cause havoc, punching a restaurateur and breaking his nose. Some locals discuss what can be done about him, but no decision is made. Marcello is silent throughout. Later that night, Simone forces Marcello to get cocaine for him from his supplier without paying for it. Accompanying him, Simone is turned down due to his debts. The thug responds by brutally beating the dealer and one of his henchmen, leaving with a haul of coke that he and Marcello consume in a strip club. On leaving, Simone is shot by a man on a motorbike. After refusing to go to hospital, Marcello takes Simone to Simone's mother's house to tend to him. Here, Simone and his mother have a brief argument over the cocaine; his mother is upset by his addiction. One day, Simone discovers that Marcello's shop shares a hollow wall with a cash-for-gold shop, and decides to rob it. Marcello tries to dissuade him, as the owner is his friend, but Simone bullies Marcello into giving him the key to his own shop. Next morning, Marcello discovers that Simone carried out the robbery, leaving a gaping hole in the wall, incriminating him. Marcello is arrested. During the questioning, a police officer makes it clear that they know Simone was responsible and tries to convince Marcello to rat, but he refuses and is imprisoned. One year later, Marcello returns home a pariah, rejected even by his cocaine supplier, and having to rebuild his business from scratch. Desperate for money, he tracks down Simone and asks for his share of the robbery (around 10,000 euros), but can see it was spent on a motorbike. Simone only gives him 300 euros. Hardened by prison, Marcello retaliates by smashing up the bike. The next day, the bully beats him up in public. After this, Marcello plots his revenge. After a few days, Marcello seeks Simone out again, apologising for the bike and proposing they rob some cocaine suppliers that are meeting at his shop, to which Simone agrees. When Simone arrives, Marcello tells him to hide in one of the dog cages and wait for his signal. Simone reluctantly does so, only to be locked in it by Marcello, who now taunts the bully. Simone manages to kick the door open, and sticks his head out, whereupon Marcello brains him with a metal bar. Marcello chains Simone to the wall, duct taping his ankles and cable tying hands together, and treats his injury, but Simone traps Marcello's head under his arms and begins to strangle him. In trying to free himself, Marcello kills Simone by causing the grooming table upon which he's sitting to lower, strangling him with the chain. Shocked, Marcello tries to dispose of the body by setting it on fire in a field. Hearing his former friends playing football (in what is likely a hallucination), he tries to capture their attention by shouting to them that the bully is finally dead, to no avail. He then takes the corpse back to the football field, only to discover that his friends have left. Marcello eventually decides to bring the corpse to a playground at the main square, waiting for people to notice.",

    "Synopsis": "The story follows Laura, a Spanish woman living in Buenos Aires, who returns with her teenage daughter Irene and young son Diego to her small hometown just outside Madrid for her younger sister's wedding. Laura runs into her old friend Paco in the town square while Irene flirts with a local teenage boy named Felipe. After dancing with Felipe at the wedding reception, Irene complains that she does not feel well and goes upstairs to sleep. Later that night, Laura goes to check on Irene only to find she is missing. She receives a text message from kidnappers urging the family to pay a large sum or they will kill Irene. The family decides not to involve the local police for Irene's safety, as the kidnappers will kill Irene if the police get close. Laura receives a text message demanding €300,000 against the release of her daughter. Chaos ensues as the family scrambles to raise the money. During a heated confrontation with Laura's father Antonio, Paco learns that some family members believe he \"owes\" them money, as the land Paco's vineyards were built on was sold to him by Laura at below market rate because he was the child of the family's servants. Laura's brother-in-law, Fernando, calms the situation and brings in his friend Jorge, a retired police officer, for consultation. During a private conversation, Jorge tells Laura that she should include members of her family on her suspect list, including her husband. Desperate to help, Paco considers selling his lands to a business partner so he can pay Irene's ransom but his wife Bea advises against it. She reveals that she has been receiving the same text messages as Laura on her phone. Laura's husband, Alejandro, is informed of the kidnapping and arrives in town. He receives a cold welcome by Laura's family before going with Laura, Paco, and Fernando to meet Jorge, who asks to talk to Alejandro alone. Alejandro becomes very upset when Jorge mentions that Laura discussed his past problems with alcoholism and his ongoing bankruptcy. Enraged by how a stranger knows this information, Alejandro leaves with Laura and they argue about the best course of action. Laura confesses to Paco that Irene is his biological daughter, conceived sixteen years prior during Laura's trip to her hometown shortly after she and Alejandro married. Shocked by this information, Paco readies to sell his estate, but Bea angrily refutes Laura's claim. She believes Laura is lying about Irene's paternity and might be involved in the kidnapping herself in order to get money out of Paco. He leaves the house anyway and comes back hours later with a duffel bag containing the ransom money. After examining Irene's upstairs room, Jorge tells Alejandro and Laura that whoever kidnapped Irene knew that Paco was her father. During a conversation with Fernando, Alejandro learns that the whole family, along with some of the townsfolk, know that Irene is not his biological daughter because of her resemblance to Paco. That night, Laura's niece Rocío sneaks out of the house and travels to an abandoned, run-down building on the outskirts of the town. Once there, she meets with her estranged husband Gabriel and his accomplice Luis. It is revealed that all three of them orchestrated Irene's kidnapping and that Gabriel has been sending the ransom messages to Laura. Luis admits that he is the one who has been sending the same ransom messages to Bea, unbeknownst to Gabriel. This angers Gabriel and prompts a crying Rocío to beg for her husband to let Irene go; their collective actions have deviated too far from the original plan and caused irreparable damage. Despite Luis's protests, Gabriel agrees to let Irene go at dawn. Rocío returns home and is questioned by her mother Mariana, Laura's older sister, as to her whereabouts. Rocío brushes her mother off, leaving Mariana suspicious. At dawn, Paco receives a voice recording of Irene begging for her rescue and a text message of where to perform the exchange. He grabs the duffel bag and drives to the destination. Once he arrives, Paco gets out of his car and rushes to inspect a loud noise made by something large being tossed into a nearby river. When he returns to his car, he finds Irene tied up in the backseat and the bag missing. He delivers Irene to Laura and Alejandro, who rush Irene to a hospital. Exhausted, Paco returns home, only to find that Bea has left him. Shortly afterwards, Laura and her family pack their belongings and say goodbye to the family as they will be returning to Argentina. Felipe promises to call Irene when she gets home. In the car, Irene asks Alejandro why it was Paco who rescued her. He does not answer. As the car drives off, Mariana sits by herself in the town square. She calls over her husband, Fernando, and asks him to sit down. As the two begin to converse, the screen fades to white.",

    "film_title": "Happy as Lazzaro",
    "Synopsis": "It gradually emerges that on an estate run as a tobacco farm called Inviolata (\"Untouched\") 54 farmhands live in primitive conditions and work in a sharecropping arrangement. The farm, isolated since 1977 by a washed-out bridge, continues to be run in a feudal manner by the notorious Marchioness Alfonsina De Luna, \"Queen of Cigarettes\", to whom the workers are constantly in debt, never paid for their work, kept in ignorance and not allowed to leave. Lazzaro is a kind and innocent worker on the farm who dutifully follows every command given by the peasants, the Marchioness, her son, Tancredi, and the estate manager Nicola. Tancredi befriends Lazzaro and decides to fake his own kidnapping to aggravate his mother and get some of her money. Tancredi and Lazzaro set out in the wild badlands, where they write a false ransom note and bond with each other. They imitate a wolf's howl to make contact with a lone wolf roaming the countryside. Tancredi warmly suggests they could be half-brothers, since his father was a womanizer. Lazzaro takes the idea of their brotherhood seriously and falls into a fever. Tancredi's mother sees through the fake kidnapping straight away, as another of her son's pranks. However, after a fake distressed call from Tancredi, the estate manager Nicola's daughter Teresa takes it seriously enough to call the police on her mobile phone during a rare surge in signal reception. This brings down disaster on the De Luna family. The police arrive on the isolated estate by helicopter and begin to search for the missing marquis; they are astonished by what they find on the farm, saying sharecropping has long been illegal, the workers should be earning wages, and that the children should have mandatory education. The police evacuate Inviolata to register the inhabitants, and Alfonsina is apparently arrested in a scandal that becomes known as the \"Great Swindle.\" Lazzaro, distracted by a police helicopter, falls off a cliff and is left behind; later a wolf (perhaps real, perhaps symbolic) spots him and identifies him by smell as a good man. When Lazzaro magically awakes, many years have passed, but he has not aged and wanders into Inviolata, which is long abandoned. It is being raided by robbers (one of whom lived there as a child). The robbers lie to Lazzaro, saying that the estate has moved and they are moving possessions for the De Luna family. They also tell him the city is within walking distance. Lazzaro sets out for the city, which he has never been to. In the city, Antonia recognizes Lazzaro from the farm. She takes him into a circle of impoverished survivors of Inviolata, who now survive by crime, having lost their home and having received no compensation or state assistance. They express disbelief and unease at his lack of aging and tell him of the Great Swindle, but Lazzaro is more concerned with finding Tancredi. Recognizing Tancredi's voice when he is calling for his dog, Lazzaro is reunited with his \"half-brother\" in a nightclub. Tancredi recognizes Lazzaro and is overjoyed. Lazzaro unwittingly joins him on another of his pranks. Tancredi visits the former estate workers and invites them for lunch in a typical display of largess, telling them to dress appropriately. Though unsure, they arrive with expensive pastries they could ill-afford as gifts, only to discover that Tancredi is bankrupt and lives in a slum, and has supposedly forgotten about their meeting. They discover that Tancredi is married to Teresa, the erstwhile estate manager Nicola's daughter. Teresa laments that the Da Luna family lost their fortune to \"the bank\". She asks if she can take the pastries, a memory from times past, and closes the door on them. While pushing their vehicle back to the squat, the crew overhears organ music from a church. They enter but are barred from staying by a nun. Somehow, the music leaves with them and fills the air around them. They consider returning to Inviolata to squat there. Lazzaro wants to help his half brother and visits a bank, where he accidentally sets off an alarm. The staff and clients are terrified as they think he has a firearm, and when asked his demands, Lazzaro simplemindedly asks for the De Luna fortune to be returned. When the terrified bank clients realize Lazzaro has only a slingshot, they beat him to death. The film ends with another vision of the wolf, which takes off from the bank and runs free through the city streets, back to the countryside.",

    "Synopsis": "A young man dances in a nightclub. He spots a man wearing a leather mask and goes with him to a room to have sex. The masked man then straps him to a bed and kills him with a dildo with a blade concealed within. In the summer of 1979 in Paris, Anne, a producer and director of gay pornography, is abandoned by her girlfriend and editor, Loïs. Anne's best friend and actor Archibald is trying to maintain a good environment for the actors while they shoot Anne's next film. After being contacted and questioned by the police, it is revealed that the young man from the beginning, Karl, had starred in many of Anne's films. Karl's death forces Anne to find another actor; she meets a young miner named Nans, who despite being heterosexual agrees to star in her upcoming film. Anne decides to center the film on Karl's murder, naming it Anal Fury V. Later, the killer murders Thierry, another of the film's actors, while he injects heroin. The whole studio is now frightened by the murders and the police's failure to protect them. Still confident, Anne hires four more actors to continue filming the film, now retitled Homocidal. The crew manages to finish the film and celebrate with a picnic in a forest. During the picnic, Anne is visited by Loïs to try to reconcile their relationship but are interrupted by a storm. Meanwhile, Misia, another actor, gets lost in the forest and is murdered by the masked killer. In a manic state, Anne chases after Loïs and sexually assaults her. Loïs runs away, leaving Anne deeply devastated. After three more deaths, Anne tries to convince the police to protect them, but they dismiss her. However, an officer gives her a clue: in each crime scene, a grackle feather was found next to the corpse. Anne contacts a pet shop to learn more about the feather and is told that it belongs to a species of blind grackle. Anne travels to a small town where its forest houses the species. In the forest, she spots a cemetery where a lonely woman is grieving. The woman tells Anne the story of her son Guy Favre, who had a secret affair with his friend Hicham. After the couple had sex in a barn, Guy's father caught them. He murdered Hicham, castrated Guy, and burned the barn with Guy inside. Guy's mother tells Anne that Guy managed to survive, albeit horribly disfigured. That night, Anne receives newspaper clippings of Guy's murder and realises that he is the killer. Intent on setting a trap for Guy, she tells the crew to film another scene with Archibald as the main actor. Meanwhile, Loïs is editing the latest scene from Homocidal when she spots Guy in the footage. Back at the shooting, the film does not make any progress, which leads to an improvising that involves mini-blackouts. As these unfold, Guy appears and murders actor Luis and attempts to murder Anne. Loïs arrives and intervenes, which causes her to get stabbed by Guy. She dies in Anne's arms as Guy escapes. Sometime later, Anne and Nans attend the premiere of Homocidal at an adult movie theater. Guy is also there, sitting near Nans. After the film ends, another of Anne's films begins playing; she realises that the murdered actors all starred in a scene which recreated Guy's tragic story, and that he wants revenge by murdering all those involved, including Anne. In a dark room, Guy attempts but is unable to murder Nans due to his physical resemblance to Hicham. Just as he is about to attack him, he is interrupted by Anne. Guy takes another man hostage and runs to another film screening, where the audience of gay men attack and kill him as payback for the fear he created in the community. In a flashback, Guy and Hicham's tragic love story is recalled with an addition: a blind grackle who revives the disfigured Guy after the fire. He suffered amnesia and went to live in Paris; his rage was later triggered when he watched Anne's film. Anne shoots her latest film and reconciles with Loïs' spirit.",

    "Synopsis": "The film is mainly set in the summer of 1981 in Leningrad. The main storyline of the film tells the story of the relationship between the 19-year-old Viktor Tsoi (Teo Yoo), 26-year-old Mike Naumenko (Roman Bilyk), and Naumenko's girlfriend Natalia (Irina Starshenbaum), as well as the formation of the Leningrad Rock Club and the recording of Kino's first album, 45. The film's setting, the Leningrad Rock Club, was one of the few state-permitted public performance spaces for rock musicians in its time. The Club is generally a theatrical venue for boundary-pushing music, where audiences are instructed to sit politely and listen rather than mosh. However, interjections by narrator Skeptic (Alexander Kuznetsov) occasionally recast the club as extravagant, hedonistic, reckless, and dangerous. The musicians live frugally; their indulgences are creative rather than material. Much of the narrative focuses on Mike, the frontman of one of the Club's more popular, old-guard bands, and his girlfriend Natacha, whose close, initially monogamous relationship stands in contrast to the expected behavior of rockstars. Also significant to the plot is Viktor, a quiet, slightly otherworldly young man with a knack for melody and a beguilingly peculiar turn of lyrical phrase. Natacha is the first to notice a kind of melancholic magic about Viktor, as the film gradually reorients itself around his budding stardom rather than Mike's less obviously ascending career. However, the film maintains a more general look at the musicians in the club, including the various musicians who come in and out of the lives of the protagonists. The film's musical numbers alternate between diegetic stage performances and sudden flights of music-video fancy. In one such performance, an altercation between musicians and more conservative citizens on a packed train escalates into a demented, carriage-traversing singalong of Talking Heads' \"Psycho Killer,\" the hitherto realist imagery disrupted with early-MTV-style cartoon flourishes. There are a few sequences in which Mike and the other Leningrad rockers seize their moment, using their music to defy the bureaucrats and wow audiences. However, nearly all of these scenes all followed by a caveat to the effect of \"this didn’t really happen.\"",

    "Synopsis": "In Tokyo, a family lives together in poverty: Hatsue, an elderly woman who owns the home and supports them with her deceased husband's pension; Nobuyo, who works for an industrial laundry service; her husband Osamu, a day laborer forced to leave his job after twisting his ankle; Aki, who works at a JK peep shop; and Shota, a young boy. Osamu and Shota routinely shoplift from stores, using a system of hand signals to communicate. Osamu tells Shota it is fine to steal things that have not been sold, as they do not belong to anyone. One cold night, they see Yuri, a neighborhood girl they regularly observe locked out on an apartment balcony, and bring her home with them. They only intend to have her stay for dinner, but after finding evidence of abuse, they choose not to return her. Yuri bonds with her new family and learns to shoplift from Osamu and Shota. Osamu urges Shota to see him as his father and Yuri as his sister, but Shota is reluctant. The family learns on television that after almost two months, police are investigating Yuri's disappearance; her parents never reported her missing. The family cuts her hair, burns her old clothes, and renames her Lin. Hatsue visits her husband's son from an affair, from whom she regularly receives money. The son and his wife are Aki's parents; they lie that their daughter is living in Australia. The family visits the beach, and Hatsue expresses contentment that she will not die a lonely death. At home that night, she dies in her sleep. Osamu and Nobuyo bury her under the house in order to avoid reporting her death and continue to collect her pension. Osamu steals a purse from a car, making Shota feel uneasy since he considers this theft against their moral code. Shota recalls joining the family after Nobuyo and Osamu found him in a locked car. Increasingly guilt-ridden about teaching Yuri to steal, Shota interrupts her theft by stealing fruit from a grocery store in view of the staff. Cornered, he jumps from a bridge and breaks his leg. Shota is hospitalized and detained by police. Nobuyo and Osamu are caught after attempting to flee with Yuri and Aki. The authorities discover Yuri and the death of Hatsue and tell Shota that the family was going to abandon him. They reveal to Aki that Nobuyo and Osamu previously killed Nobuyo's abusive husband in self-defense, and that Hatsue was receiving money from Aki's parents. Nobuyo takes the blame for the crimes to protect Osamu, who has a previous criminal record, and is sentenced to prison. Shota is placed in an orphanage. Osamu and Shota visit Nobuyo in prison, and she gives Shota details of the car they found him in so he can search for his parents. Shota stays overnight with Osamu, against the orphanage's rules. When Shota asks, Osamu tells him the truth, confirming that they intended to abandon him, and says he can no longer be his father. The next morning, as he is about to depart, Shota says that he allowed himself to be caught. Osamu runs after Shota's bus; Shota looks back and finally acknowledges Osamu as his father. Yuri is returned to her parents, who continue to neglect her, and looks wistfully back at the house she shared with the family.",

    "Synopsis": "Set in 1993, Jacques (Pierre Deladonchamps) is a 39-year-old gay author living and working in Paris. He is a part-time, albeit inattentive, father to his young son Loulou, who stays with him every other night. Loulou is accustomed to his father's bouts of self-indulgent melancholy as well as his manic appreciation for the arts and his string of young lovers. At the same time, Jacques is in the process of coming to terms with his health's steady decline due to AIDS, which is simultaneously and severely affecting his ex-lover Marco. When Marco is rejected by his lover Thierry and comes to stay with Jacques, the two discuss again their intentions to commit suicide before they can be claimed by the disease. Jacques lives on the floor below his good friend Mathieu (Denis Podalydès), an older gay man and newspaper editor who regular caters to Jacques's flamboyant episodes. In the meantime, Jacques meets 22-year-old Arthur (Vincent Lacoste), a student and camp counselor, during a work event in Brittany. Arthur is in the throes of a relatively newfound homosexual lifestyle, and he finds himself disenchanted by his generation's rejection of literature and shame of sex; for these reasons, he is drawn to Jacques and his intellectualism. Jacques understands his own reticence to commit to a proper relationship because of a current fling with the young Jean-Marie, and because of his AIDS, but finds himself immensely interested in Arthur. Despite Jacques's intentions to keep things platonic, the two sleep together a few times before Jacques returns home to Paris. As Jacques's AIDS worsens—not a problem for Arthur, who accepts him wholeheartedly—Arthur comes to visit, during which Jacques admits that he has attempted to reject Arthur because he refuses to die stricken by grief that a new love must be over too soon. Arthur appreciates Jacques's lyrical philosophies but cannot accept that he must let Jacques go—or that Jacques could truly want him to. The two spend an evening with Mathieu that ends with Arthur's proclamation that the two \"could make a good life together\", eventually returning to Brittany to inform his friends he is moving to Paris to be with Jacques. Arthur waits for Jacques to return his calls in order to finalise their plans, completely unaware that he is in the midst of organising his suicide. Jacques brings his life's diaries to Mathieu and says his goodbyes, never returning Arthur's final call.",

    "Synopsis": "Sinan is an aspiring young writer who has just finished college. Returning to his hometown of Çan, he sets about trying to find local funding to publish his debut manuscript, which he calls a \"quirky auto-fiction meta-novel\", but finds that the locals are uninterested. He also discovers that his eccentric father, Idris, has allowed his gambling addiction to disastrously reduce the family's fortune and stature. Worried about his career prospects and finding himself socially isolated in his rural hometown, Sinan wanders the countryside and engages in a series of testy conversations with various relatives and locals, including an established writer and two Imams who hold differing opinions about religion's place in the modern world. Eventually, disgusted by his father's degenerate gambling and suspecting him of stealing money, Sinan sells his father's beloved dog for the money to have his book published. He then leaves town for his required military service. When he returns, he finds that his father has abandoned his family, and is now living as a rural shepherd. The two reconnect in a friendly conversation where Idris reveals that he has given up his long-running quixotic attempt to dig a well on his arid property, and that he has read and enjoyed Sinan's book (making him the only person who appears to have done so). In a surreal moment, it appears that Sinan has hanged himself in the abandoned well, but the film then abruptly cuts to Idris awakening. Looking about for his absent son, he walks over to the well to find Sinan at the bottom, continuing to dig.",

    "film_title": "Under the Silver Lake",
    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words --> In the summer of 2011, Sam is an aimless 33-year-old in Silver Lake, Los Angeles, more interested in conspiracy theories than paying his overdue rent. Spying on a topless neighbor, Sam notices another neighbor, Sarah, and learns that billionaire Jefferson Sevence has disappeared. Sarah invites Sam over to watch How to Marry a Millionaire, but they are interrupted by her roommates; she suggests he come back the next day, and Sam attacks a group of boys for vandalizing his car. In the morning, Sam discovers Sarah and her roommates have moved out overnight, with a symbol painted in their apartment. He follows a stranger from the apartment to a rooftop party in Downtown Los Angeles, where a Balloon Girl and the band Jesus & the Brides of Dracula perform. Sam tries to confront the stranger, and Sevence's daughter, Millicent, leaves upon learning her father has died. He is given a cookie as his ticket to the band's private show at Hollywood Forever Cemetery, and the news reveals Sevence and three women burned to death in a car, with evidence one of them was Sarah. Sam visits the Comic Fan, the author of a zine called Under the Silver Lake, who explains that the symbol in Sarah's apartment is a hobo code meaning \"stay quiet\". The Comic Fan insists that hidden messages are everywhere, possibly connecting Sarah's disappearance, a mysterious Dog Killer, and the Owl's Kiss—a supernatural murderer appearing as a nude woman in an owl mask—and shows Sam a collector's cereal box containing a map of Los Angeles. At the cemetery show, Sam is required to bite the cookie to enter and meets the Balloon Girl, who knew Sarah. Drugged by the cookie, Sam chases after the stranger but passes out at Janet Gaynor's grave. An actress working for \"Shooting Stars\" escort service remembers Sarah from a party, where they were forbidden from entering a wealthy songwriter's home. Decoding a message hidden in the band's new album, Sam is led from Griffith Observatory by the self-proclaimed Homeless King to a secret underground shelter, with tunnels throughout the city. The Comic Fan appears to have committed suicide, but his home surveillance footage reveals a visit from the Owl's Kiss. Taking the cereal box, Sam is brought to a chess party, where he forces the band's frontman to admit that some of his songs were provided by the mysterious songwriter. Balloon Girl and her fellow Shooting Stars lead Sam to the elderly Songwriter, who claims to have ghostwritten history's most popular music, encoded with hidden messages. The Songwriter shoots at Sam when he demands to know who paid him, and Sam beats him to death with Kurt Cobain's guitar. Stalked by the Owl's Kiss, Sam is spared when his landlord arrives with a sheriff's deputy, giving him one more day before eviction. Following a coyote to another party, Sam meets Millicent Sevence, swimming together in Silver Lake Reservoir. Giving him a bracelet matching Sarah's, Millicent is fatally shot in a pose eerily similar to Sam's favorite vintage Playboy cover. Sam realizes the bracelet is engraved with chess moves, using them to plot coordinates on a Nintendo Power diagram and overlaying the map from the cereal box to reveal an off-the-grid location in the Hollywood Hills. There, Sam finds the stranger, Troy, and her two friends with a man, who offers him tea and explains that throughout history, wealthy men like him have sealed themselves with three wives in elaborate tombs, including the underground shelter, in order for their souls to \"ascend\" to another domain. Sarah and her roommates were Sevence's wives, having faked their deaths and already been sealed underground. Speaking with Sam by video phone, Sarah is at peace with her fate. Drugged by the tea, Sam is interrogated by the Homeless King, who is annoyed by dog biscuits in his pocket, but lets him go. Returning home, Sam has sex with his topless neighbor, whose parrot repeats an incomprehensible word. From her balcony, Sam watches as his landlord and the deputy enter his apartment to evict him, discovering a wall painted with the \"stay quiet\" symbol.",

    "Synopsis": "Austrian peasant farmer Franz Jägerstätter, born and brought up in the small village of St. Radegund, is working his land when war breaks out. Married to Franziska, colloquially Fani, the couple are important members of the tight-knit rural community. They live a simple life with the passing years marked by the arrival of the couple's three girls. Franz is called up for basic training in the German army and is away from his beloved wife and children for months. Eventually, when France surrenders and it seems the war might end soon, he is sent back from training. With his mother and sister-in-law Resie, he and his wife farm the land and raise their children amid the mountains and valleys of upper Austria, cutting hay and gathering. As the war goes on, Jägerstätter and the other able-bodied men in the village are called up to fight. Their first requirement is to swear an oath of allegiance to Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich. Despite pressure from the mayor and his neighbors, who increasingly ostracize him and his family, and from the Bishop of Linz, Jägerstätter refuses. Wrestling with the knowledge that his decision will mean arrest and even death, he finds strength in his faith in God, his prayers, and Fani's love and support. He is taken to prison, first in Enns, then in Berlin and waits months for his trial. During his time in prison, he and Fani write letters to each other and give each other strength. Fani and their daughters are victims of growing hostility in the village over her husband's decision not to fight. Fani is eventually able to visit her husband in Berlin. After months of brutal incarceration, Jägerstätter's case goes to trial. He is found guilty and sentenced to death. Despite many opportunities to sign the oath of allegiance, and the promise of non-combatant work, he continues to refuse and is executed by the Third Reich on August 9, 1943, while his wife and daughters survive.",

One night, the workers decide to leave the country by sea, in search of a brighter future in Spain. Among them is Souleiman, the lover of Ada. However, Ada is betrothed to another man – the wealthy Omar. Ada is deeply worried about Souleiman, as she waits for news of his fate in the run-up to her wedding.

    "Synopsis": "In the near future, the people of Bacurau, an impoverished, rural settlement in the fictional municipality of Serra Verde, in western Pernambuco, gather for the funeral of Carmelita, an elderly woman seen as the matriarch of the community. Her granddaughter Teresa, now a young woman, returns to town after many years for the occasion, and to deliver some medicine. In the following days, the village experiences a sequence of strange events, including the town inexplicably disappearing from online maps and satellite images, loss of mobile phone signal, sightings of a UFO-shaped drone and an unnamed couple from southern Brazil passing through town on motorcycles. There is an ongoing dispute over water rights from the local river, with water being dammed upstream in a corrupt scheme masterminded by the wealthy mayor of Serra Verde, Tony Junior. He visits Bacurau in an attempt to secure its residents' votes in an upcoming election with old food and tattered books, but no water; the townspeople all hide to avoid him. A tanker truck of water finally arrives for the town, but it has been riddled with bullets. When horses stampede through town, two local men are sent to investigate the nearby farm from where they presumably escaped and find the family that owned it murdered. As they attempt to leave the property, they too are murdered, by the southern motorcyclists. This couple then meets again up with a group of mostly American foreigners led by Michael (a German living in the United States for over 40 years). The couple is chastised for killing the two men, as killing them deprived the foreigners of two chances to score \"points.\" After receiving unheard instructions through earpieces, the foreigners kill the couple and then argue over who earned the points for their deaths. The foreigners begin hunting the townspeople, and Pacote, Teresa's former lover, seeks out Lunga, a revolutionary protecting and being sheltered by the townspeople. Pacote convinces Lunga to join his fight against the foreigners. As the townspeople arm themselves, the foreigners kill a nine-year-old boy and cut off the town's electricity. The following morning, as the foreigners go hunting, they are gradually overpowered and killed by the locals, with the exception of Michael, who ends up captured. Tony Junior shows up to collect the foreigners in a luxury minibus. When he sees that the townspeople have won, he denies knowing the foreigners until the captured Michael yells to him for help. The mayor is sent away to die in the desert, half-naked and tied up to a donkey, while Michael is buried alive in an underground cell while shouting \"this is only the beginning.\"",

    "Synopsis": "The film begins with images of the crowd in Paris celebrating the victory of the French team at the 2018 FIFA World Cup on the Avenue des Champs-Élysées, perceived and celebrated in France as a moment of brotherhood among people of different social classes, ethnicities, and backgrounds. Soon after, Stéphane Ruiz, a police officer who recently moved to Paris and joined the anti-crime brigade, is assigned to work with squad leader Chris and brigadier Gwada on duty in the nearby city of Montfermeil. Chris often aggressively abuses his power on young people, with Gwada complacent in that abuse; while feeling unease, Stéphane doesn't interfere. Meanwhile, Issa, a known juvenile delinquent, steals Johnny, a lion cub, from a circus, causing its owner Zorro to go to the local community leader known as \"the Mayor\" and threaten to return with firearms if Johnny is not returned. Chris and his squadron are tasked with finding and retrieving the cub. One of Issa's friends takes a picture of Issa with the cub and posts it on Instagram, leading Chris to find out that Issa is the culprit. They chase, capture, and handcuff him, but he claims that the cub had run away. Issa's friends then attack the three officers, throwing things at them to stop them from taking Issa in. When Issa tries to run away, Gwada, having accidentally tear-gassed himself during the chase, shoots him in the face with a flash-ball. Issa's friends scatter, but the squadron realizes that they have been filmed by a drone, which escapes. While Stéphane wants to take a badly wounded Issa to a hospital, Chris and Gwada refuse, and instead, the trio take him with them in their search for the drone's owner. The trio arrives at a local neighborhood contact of Chris, leaving Issa in their care and using information given to them by that contact to find Buzz, the person the drone belongs to, forcing him to flee before he can upload the video. Buzz, who still carries the drone's memory card, escapes the squadron and takes shelter with Salah, a restaurant owner and key member of the local Islamic community. Both the squadron and the Mayor, having found out, arrive at Salah's restaurant. After a tense confrontation during which Chris attempts to illegally arrest Buzz, Ruiz convinces Salah to give him the memory card, claiming that Issa's shooting was just an accident. After recovering Issa and the cub (which happened to be spotted near them), the squadron takes the two to the circus. Although Issa is made to apologize, Zorro attempts to lock him as well as the cub inside a cage with a lion, scaring Issa into wetting himself and almost making Stéphane shoot the lion until Issa is eventually let go. Deciding that Issa has learned his lesson, Chris drops him off and warns him not to tell anyone what happened and, if asked about his injury, to say that he slipped and fell. In the evening, the characters involved in that day's event seemingly return to their normal lives, some with visible signs of distress and doubt. Issa, who had been told earlier that his father did not want him back home because of his behavior, sits alone on a ruined couch, traumatized. Later that night, Ruiz meets Gwada in a bar and tells him that he knows that a flash-ball cannot be fired by accident, and that Gwada had therefore intentionally shot Issa. Gwada blames his stress and the group for overwhelming him, and Stéphane, while unconvinced, leaves Gwada with the card, telling him to \"do what you gotta do.\" The next day, the squadron, while on patrol, gets attacked by a small group led by Issa. They chase them, falling into Issa's trap and ending up assaulted by a much larger group of young people, leaving them trapped from all sides in a stairwell and fighting for their lives. Chris is wounded when a bottle breaks on his face, and the backup car Stéphane radios for gets immediately destroyed by the young people, forcing the backup policemen to flee. They also attack the Mayor's office and end up clubbing him and throwing him down a set of stairs. Stéphane pounds on the nearest door, begging for help, which happens to be the door to Buzz's apartment; however, Buzz further locks the door. Issa lights a Molotov cocktail and prepares to finish the squadron off with it, leading Stéphane to point his gun at him and warn him not to. The screen fades to black as both Issa and Stéphane try to decide what to do next, and a quote from Victor Hugo's Les Misérables appears: \"Remember this, my friends: there are no such things as bad plants or bad humans. There are only bad cultivators.\"",

    "Synopsis": "Alice Woodard is a plant breeder who works in a lab that focuses on creating new strains of flowers. While her colleague Bella is failing at creating a hardy plant that will survive even weeks of undernourishment and neglect, Alice and her team have successfully created a flower that requires more care than an ordinary plant but which makes their owners happy. Alice decides to name the plants \"Little Joe\" in honour of her son and smuggles out one of the plants for him. The Little Joes begin to aggressively pollinate, which Alice theorizes is because she has made them sterile. The same day Bella's dog, Bello, goes missing. Work colleague Chris goes looking for him and accidentally inhales some of the pollen. Later on he takes Alice out and, despite her obvious reluctance, attempts to kiss her twice. The following day, Bella finds Bello in the lab. He attacks her and she insists that he has changed. Chris later tells Alice that Bella is mentally ill and had previously attempted suicide before being forced on a year-long sabbatical, returning only shortly before Alice began working at the lab. Alice later learns that Bella had Bello put down. Bella tells Alice that the changes to Bello were due to the plant. Alice's son is accidentally pollinated by the plant and begins to act strangely, sneaking his classmate Selma into the lab and stealing a Little Joe. He later tells Alice that he is considering moving in with his father, Ivan. Bothered by her son's behaviour, Alice begins to examine test footage of subjects who have been exposed to the pollen. In every case their family members report that they are acting strangely and have seemed to change since the pollen test. However, just as Alice begins to believe Bella's suspicions, Bella is exposed to the pollen herself and dismisses her previous beliefs as paranoia due to her mental issues. Joe reveals that he and Selma stole the plant in order to pollinate Ivan, confirming Alice's suspicions that her plant carries a virus, especially as she has used unorthodox methods to create Little Joe. However, this turns out to be a joke as Chris previously talked to Joe about Alice's concerns. At work Bella reveals that she never inhaled the pollen and was only pretending to be happy in order to blend in with the others. Immediately afterwards, Alice overhears Bella fall off of a staircase during a confrontation with Chris. After Alice's boss dismisses her concerns, she takes matters into her own hands and decides to kill the Little Joes before they are commercialized, lowering the temperature in the lab. She is stopped by Chris, who, in trying to prevent her from harming the plants, knocks her out on the floor of the lab, exposing her to the plant pollen. Later, Alice learns that Little Joe has been nominated for an award, meaning that the plant will be sold worldwide. When Chris apologizes for hitting her, she kisses him, and later dismisses her concerns as paranoia. She allows Joe to move in with his father and starts a new, happier life with her own Little Joe.",

    "Synopsis": "Matthias and Maxime are lifelong friends in their late twenties living in Montreal. The motivated but uptight Matthias is a successful businessman with a caring girlfriend, Sarah, while the quieter, gentler Maxime is a bartender who spends time taking care of his abusive, alcoholic mother. Matthias is primed for a promotion at his job while Maxime is preparing to move to Australia for work opportunities. The two take a trip to the lakeside cabin of a wealthy friend, Rivette. Rivette's pushy sister, Érika, is a film student and pressures Matthias and Maxime to appear in her student short film, as her two actors have dropped out. Maxime capitulates and agrees to participate in the project, and Matthias is later forced to join after losing a bet to Rivette. They are upset to later learn that their scene will require them to kiss, but their friends remind them that they had kissed before, years earlier in high school, which Matthias claimed was the result of him being under the influence of party drugs. Nevertheless, they share a kiss (offscreen) for the film. The kiss has a profound, distracting effect on Matthias, who cannot sleep the next morning and goes for a swim, accidentally ending up on the wrong side of the lake; later, he turns down a job promotion and argues with Sarah. He is further unnerved when Erika shows the completed short film at a get-together thrown by her mother, though Sarah seems to understand his conflicted feelings. Meanwhile, Maxime turns over care of his mother's estate to his aunt and tries to obtain a letter of recommendation from Matthias' father, who is a successful businessman in Chicago. Both men are further confused by the kiss due to their understood interest in women, and Matthias is especially upset because of his relationship with Sarah. Matthias tries to get out of attending Maxime's party, apparently in denial that he will actually leave for Australia, but Sarah pushes for him to go. He upsets their friends by arriving late, making a poor speech for Maxime, and initially turning down the invitation for an afterparty with the rest of their friends, before Sarah convinces him to attend. At the afterparty, he further antagonizes the group by starting an argument during a party game and getting into a fight, culminating in insulting Maxime's facial birthmark. Matthias leaves the party angrily before returning and apologizing. After the night is over, he and Maxime share a kiss and a brief sexual encounter, but Matthias breaks away, leaving Maxime hurt and confused. Later, Matthias goes to a strip club with a business associate before abruptly leaving to run through the streets. Maxime cleans out his house in preparation for moving and discovers a childhood drawing of himself and Matthias living on a farm together, which touches him. He finally receives a call back from the office of Matthias' father, as he had inquired after his missing letter of recommendation; the secretary informs him that it was actually sent to Matthias, who had failed to forward it to him. Maxime realizes Matthias' state of denial and has the letter forwarded to his email directly. Ready to leave, Maxime departs his home to meet a friend who will take him to the airport, and is happy to see that Matthias is there waiting for him as well.",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words only.--><!--Character names with quotations appear so because they appear as such in the film's credits--> In February 1969, Hollywood actor Rick Dalton, a former Western TV star, copes with a fading career, his most recent roles being guest appearances as TV villains. Agent Marvin Schwarz suggests working in spaghetti Westerns in Italy, which Dalton considers inferior. Dalton's best friend, stunt double, personal assistant, and driver is Cliff Booth, a World War II special ops veteran living in a trailer with his pit bull Brandy. Booth struggles to find stunt work due to a past altercation with Bruce Lee, and rumors that he killed his wife. Although he does not know them personally, Dalton is aware that young actress Sharon Tate and her husband, director Roman Polanski, live next door. Dalton longs to befriend them, thinking it could reignite his career. While fixing the TV antenna on Dalton's roof, Booth notices a hippie arriving at the Polanski residence. The man, Charles Manson, asks for music producer Terry Melcher, but Tate's friend, Jay Sebring, says Melcher has moved. Later, Tate watches herself in The Wrecking Crew at a local film theater, and Booth gives hitchhiker Pussycat a ride to Spahn Ranch, a former Western film set where Booth did stunt work. Booth checks on George Spahn, the ranch's nearly blind owner, seeking to make sure the hippies living there are not exploiting him. Booth physically forces ranch hippie Clem to change his car tire after it was deliberately punctured. The hippies' leader Tex is summoned to deal with the situation, but he arrives as Booth is driving away. While filming an episode for the TV series Lancer, Dalton struggles to deliver his lines, causing him to have an emotional breakdown in his trailer. He later gives a powerful performance during his character's speech, impressing director Sam Wanamaker and his co-star Trudi, boosting his confidence. Schwarz books Dalton to star in a Sergio Corbucci spaghetti Western. Booth accompanies Dalton for the six-month shoot in Italy, where Dalton films three additional films and marries Italian starlet Francesca Capucci. Before returning to the US, Dalton tells Booth that he can no longer afford his salary, which Booth amicably understands. Returning to Los Angeles on August 8, 1969, Dalton and Booth go drinking to commemorate their time together. Returning to Dalton's house, Booth smokes an acid-laced cigarette and takes Brandy for a walk, while Dalton makes margaritas. Manson's followers Tex, Sadie, Katie and Flowerchild arrive to murder the Tate house occupants. Hearing a car's loud muffler, an enraged Dalton orders the group off the private street. Recognizing him, the family members decide to kill him instead, when Sadie reasons that through television shows such as Dalton's, Hollywood has \"taught them to murder\". Flowerchild deserts the group, fleeing with their car. Breaking into Dalton's house armed with knives and a gun, the remaining group confronts Capucci and Booth, with Tex announcing that he is “the Devil and here to do the Devil’s business”. Booth recognizes them from Spahn Ranch and orders Brandy to attack. Brandy mauls Tex and bites off his genitals, and Cliff finishes him off by stomping him to death. He is stabbed by Katie, but swiftly beats her to death using random objects around the home. Brandy attacks and disfigures Sadie, who crashes through the back garden and startles Dalton, who has been listening to music and was totally unaware of the fighting inside. As Sadie attempts to shoot him, Dalton retrieves a working stunt flamethrower from a shed and incinerates her with it. After the police have taken statements and an ambulance brings Booth to hospital, Sebring and Tate invite Dalton to Tate's house for a drink.",

    "Synopsis": "Madrid-based filmmaker Salvador Mallo's health is in decline, which has made him depressed and reflective. His back pain and headaches have kept him from considering a new project for several years, and recently he has experienced persistent dysphagia. Flavor, one of Salvador's old films, has just been restored, and he is asked to appear at a screening. He has not seen the film's lead Alberto in decades, having fallen out over Alberto's heroin use during filming. Still, he reaches out to Alberto and asks him to present Flavor with him. When Alberto prepares to smoke heroin, he is surprised Salvador wants to join. Under the influence, Salvador remembers moving with his impoverished parents into a cave-house in Paterna as a child. When Alberto arrives to take Salvador to the screening, Salvador decides not to go, but the moderator poses audience questions to him over the phone. When asked about their old argument, Salvador repeats his old criticisms and blurts out that Alberto took heroin during filming. Although he says he now approves of Alberto's performance, Alberto is enraged and leaves. Salvador starts to regularly take heroin to manage his pain. He remembers when, as a boy, his mother arranged for him to teach a young man named Eduardo how to read, in exchange for work on the cave. She then used this as evidence of his intelligence to gain him admittance to a seminary. Although he did not want to leave home or become a priest, his mother saw it as the only way they could afford to get him an education. To make amends, Salvador agrees to let Alberto stage a story he wrote about a relationship he had in the 1980s that fell apart due to his partner Federico's heroin use. Coincidentally, Federico attends the show and obtains Salvador's contact information from Alberto. When the former lovers meet, Federico says he has been living in Argentina and that this is his first time in Madrid in decades. He reveals he has a wife, from whom he is separated, and two sons, and that he has not dated a man since he broke up with Salvador. On his way out the door, Federico offers to stay the night, but Salvador says they should leave their relationship in the past. Salvador then discards his heroin. Accompanied by his assistant, Mercedes, he sees doctors about his pain and dysphagia, and admits to his heroin use. He reveals that he has not recovered either from his mother's death or his back surgery from years earlier. Salvador reminisces with Mercedes about his mother's last days, spent with him in Madrid, when she revealed she did not want him to write stories about her and thought he resented her for sending him to the seminary. Although Salvador was able to apologise for not being the son she wanted, he feels guilty he was not able to take her to her village to die, like he had promised. Mercedes shows Salvador an invitation card to an art gallery and he recognises the painting of a boy on it. He remembers when Eduardo began sketching him after working at the Mallos' cave-house. Eduardo then bathed himself, and young Salvador fainted upon seeing him naked, marking his sexual awakening. Salvador goes to the gallery and learns that the owner had found Eduardo's artwork at a flea market. Salvador buys the painting and discovers a letter written on the back in which Eduardo thanks him for his help tutoring him. Meanwhile, a CT scan reveals the cause of his dysphagia as an easily operable calcified growth in his neck, and not a tumour as feared. On the way to his surgery, Salvador muses to Mercedes that his mother must have received the portrait but never mentioned it to him. Mercedes asks if he will try to find Eduardo, but Salvador says too much time has passed and what matters is that the painting finally made its way to him. As Salvador slips into unconsciousness on the operating table, he mentions to his doctor that he has started writing again. He is then seen on a film set directing a scene from his childhood, in a meta-like ending with Penelope Cruz and Asier Flores.",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 to 700 words only. --> Kim Ki-taek and Chung-sook live in a semi-basement flat ( ) in Seoul with their daughter Ki-jung and son Ki-woo. As the family has financial struggles and low-income jobs, family friend Min-hyuk gives them a scholar's rock meant to promise wealth. Leaving to study abroad, he suggests that Ki-woo lie about his qualifications to take over Min-hyuk's job as an English tutor for Da-hye, the daughter of the wealthy but naïve Park family. Min-hyuk trusts Ki-woo because he likes Da-hye and wants to ask her out when he returns. After Ki-jung helps forge a certificate for him, Ki-woo, posing as a Yonsei University student named \"Kevin\", goes to the Parks' home, where he is hired by the mother Mrs Park by the end of his first lesson. The Kims' scheme is to secure jobs for each family member within the Park household while concealing their true identities. Ki-woo recommends \"Jessica,\" actually Ki-jung, as an art therapist for the Parks' young son, Da-song, who has been traumatised after seeing a \"ghost\" in their kitchen. Ki-jung then frames Yoon, the Parks' chauffeur, by making it appear as though he had a sexual encounter in the car, leading to Ki-taek being hired as his replacement. The Kims exploit the peach allergy of the Parks' longtime housekeeper, Moon-gwang, to convince Mrs Park that Moon-gwang has tuberculosis, and Chung-sook is hired as her replacement. Meanwhile, Ki-woo begins a secret romantic relationship with Da-hye. While the Parks are away on a camping trip, the Kims revel in the luxuries of the house when Moon-gwang suddenly appears at the door, claiming to have forgotten something in the basement. She goes through a hidden entrance to an underground bunker created by the house's architect and previous owner, who had kept its existence secret from the Parks. There, Moon-gwang's husband, Geun-sae, has been hiding from loan sharks and is revealed to be the \"ghost\" Da-song saw when Geun-sae was trying to leave the bunker to steal food. Moon-gwang begs Chung-sook to allow Geun-sae to continue living there in exchange for regular payments, but the three other Kims, who are eavesdropping, accidentally reveal their true identities. Moon-gwang films them and threatens to expose their deception to the Parks. After the Parks call to inform the Kims that they are returning early due to a sudden severe rainstorm, the Kims quickly destroy all evidence of their ruse and subdue Moon-gwang and Geun-sae in the bunker, although Moon-gwang is injured during the struggle. The Kims manage to escape, but the torrential rain floods their flat with sewage water, forcing them to take shelter in a gymnasium alongside other displaced people. The next day, Mrs Park organises an impromptu garden party for Da-song's birthday, with the elder Kims assisting while the younger Kims are invited as guests. Ki-woo enters the bunker with his scholar's rock, intending to kill Geun-sae and Moon-gwang. Moon-gwang is already dead from injuries sustained in the previous day's brawl; Geun-sae bludgeons Ki-woo with the rock, leaving him unconscious. Geun-sae then leaves the bunker and stabs Ki-jung with a kitchen knife in front of horrified party guests. Da-song faints upon seeing the \"ghost\" again. Chung-sook impales Geun-sae with a barbecue skewer after a struggle. While Ki-taek tends to Ki-jung, Mr Park orders him to drive Da-song to the hospital. Ki-taek, gradually enraged by the Parks' lack of empathy or awareness of their own privilege, stabs him with Geun-sae's knife and flees. Weeks later, Ki-woo is recovering from brain surgery, and he and Chung-sook have been convicted of fraud and placed on probation. Ki-jung has died from her injuries, and Ki-taek – now a wanted fugitive – has disappeared. Geun-sae is presumed to have been a random homeless man, and the motives for the murders remain unsolved. Ki-woo spies on the Parks' former home, now owned by a foreign family, and notices a Morse code message in a light visible from outside. Ki-taek, hiding in the bunker, has buried Moon-gwang in the garden and sends daily messages, hoping Ki-woo will see them. Still living in a semi-basement flat with his mother, Ki-woo writes a letter to Ki-taek, vowing to earn enough money one day to buy the house and free him.",

    "Synopsis": "At the end of the 18th century, Marianne, a painter, is teaching an art class in France. One of her students asks her about a painting of hers, which Marianne calls Portrait de la jeune fille en feu. Years earlier, Marianne arrives on a distant island in Brittany. She has been commissioned to paint a portrait of a young woman of the gentry named Héloïse, who is to be married off to a Milanese nobleman. Héloïse's mother, the Countess, tells Marianne that Héloïse has previously refused to pose for portraits, as she does not want to be married; she had been living in a convent before her older sister's suicide necessitated her return and her betrothal. Marianne acts as Héloïse's hired companion to be able to paint her in secret and accompanies her on daily walks along the rugged coastline to memorize Héloïse's features. Marianne finishes the portrait, but finds herself unable to betray Héloïse's trust and reveals her true reason for arriving. After Héloïse criticises the painting, which does not seem to portray her true nature, Marianne destroys the work and tells the Countess she can create a better painting. As the Countess is getting ready to fire Marianne, Héloïse says that she will pose for Marianne. The Countess is shocked to hear this and gives Marianne five days to complete the new portrait while she is away on the mainland. Marianne is haunted throughout the house by visions of Héloïse in a wedding dress. One evening, they read the story of Orpheus and Eurydice and debate the reason Orpheus turns around to look at his wife, causing her to be returned to the underworld, with Héloïse suggesting that Eurydice asked him to. Later, the two go to a bonfire gathering where women sing and Héloïse's dress briefly catches fire. The next day, Marianne and Héloïse share their first kiss and have sex later that night. They spend the next few days together, during which their bond grows stronger, and help the housemaid, Sophie, get an abortion. With their relationship about to be cut short by the Countess's return, Marianne sketches a drawing of Héloïse to remember her by, and Héloïse asks Marianne to draw a nude sketch of herself on page 28 of her book. The Countess approves of the new portrait, and the next morning Marianne bids farewell. As she is about to leave the house, she hears Héloïse say, \"Turn around\". She turns and sees Héloïse in her wedding dress. In the present, Marianne reveals that she saw Héloïse two more times. The first was in the form of a portrait at an art exhibition, in which Héloïse, with a child beside her, is portrayed holding a book and surreptitiously revealing the edge of page 28. The second time was at a concert in Milan, where she notices Héloïse among the patrons seated in the balcony across the theater from her. Unobserved, Marianne watches as Héloïse is overwhelmed by emotion while listening to the orchestra playing the Presto from \"Summer\" in Vivaldi's Four Seasons, music that Marianne had played for her on a harpsichord years before.",

With no education or professional training, Ricky is given an opportunity when he is hired to run a franchise as a self-employed delivery driver under the supervision of Maloney, a tough, no-nonsense employer. In order to afford a van for the job, Ricky convinces his wife Abby to sell the family car, even though she uses it in her work as a home care nurse. For Ricky, this new job provides constant stress which he is not enjoying. With his job being a delivery driver, he is always under pressure to make his deliveries in time and is fined if he is late or makes mistakes. Abby, as well, finds her work much more demanding without a car. Due to her demanding schedule, she frequently feels upset by the lack of time she is allowed to spend with her patients. During this period, Ricky's rebellious son Seb skips school and often gets into trouble with his use of graffiti. Following a fight with his parents, Seb angrily tags over the family portraits during the night. When Ricky can't find the keys to his van the next morning, he blames Seb. Though Seb denies any wrongdoing, Ricky hits him at the end of a heated argument. Liza Jane, Seb's younger sister, later tearfully admits that she hid the keys as she blames Ricky's job for the family's problems. Back at work, Ricky is robbed and brutally assaulted while making deliveries. While Ricky is in the waiting room at hospital, Maloney phones him and explains that he is facing fines of over £1,000 as his barcode scanner was destroyed in the assault. While Seb finally warms up and re-joins the family, a desperate and grievously injured Ricky drives off to work in tears as his family begs him to not leave.",

They briefly interact with Hermit Bob, a bearded eccentric, in the woods. On their way back to the station, Cliff notices there is still daylight after 8 p.m. and Ronnie's watch and cell phone stop working. Later, at a diner, hardware store owner Hank Thompson hears a radio report concerning polar fracking. Two corpses reanimate when night falls and kill the two diner employees, who are discovered by Hank the next morning. Ronnie believes zombies killed the employees. Young travelers Zoe, Jack, and Zack stop for gas and meet Bobby. At the Centerville Juvenile Detention Center, inmate Geronimo tells fellow inmates Olivia and Stella that polar fracking has altered the Earth's rotation. Cliff and Ronnie find open graves at the cemetery, while Hermit Bob spies on them. Cliff emphatically rejects Ronnie's suggestion of informing Farmer Miller of the general suspicion that zombies are on the loose. Ronnie teaches Cliff how to kill zombies, and Bobby and Hank prepare weapons. Motel owner Danny Perkins watches news about pets behaving strangely and then finds out his cats are missing. Other of Farmer Miller's animals have disappeared. That evening, more zombies rise, and Danny is attacked and transformed. Cliff and Ronnie bring supplies to the station and tell fellow officer Mindy Morrison about the zombies. The corpse of Mallory, a local alcoholic, reanimates in the police station and Ronnie decapitates her. Two corpses reanimate at the funeral home and are beheaded with a sword by Zelda Winston, who recently bought the funeral home. She goes to the police station, where the three officers leave her to operate communications. The cops drive through town and find the three travelers dead at the motel. Ronnie beheads the bodies, much to Mindy's distress, and takes Zoe's Sturgill Simpson CD. Zelda waves her hand over the police computer and it generates code. Ronnie begins playing the CD on the police car sound system, but Cliff throws the CD out the car window. Hank and Bobby face zombies at the hardware store. Each zombie says only one word, related to something from their past or an item they see as a zombie. Zombies maul Farmer Miller. Inmates Geronimo, Olivia, and Stella flee the detention center, again observed by Hermit Bob. When zombies overwhelm the patrol car at the cemetery, Officer Mindy sees her dead grandmother, and exits the car, only to be engulfed by zombies. Ronnie says he knew all would end badly because Jim gave him the entire script ahead of time, while Cliff only got the pages for his own scenes. Zelda drives Ronnie's car through town, stopping to behead one last Fashion Zombie, and then walks calmly through the cemetery with sword in hand. Zombies amble away from the patrol car as a spinning UFO appears over the cemetery. Cliff and Ronnie watch as it beams up Zelda and departs. The two leave the car, and kill zombies including Bobby, Miller, Danny, Hank, and Mindy. Hermit Bob watches from the woods through binoculars, lamenting how the world is a terrible place, as zombies overwhelm Cliff and Ronnie.",

    "Synopsis": "In the 1980s, the period of maximum power of the mafia clans in Italy, the Cosa Nostra of Palermo and Corleonesi factions (headed by Totò Riina), competing for the drug market, maintain a facade of friendship and collaboration. Tommaso Buscetta (Pierfrancesco Favino), affiliated with Cosa Nostra and known as the \"boss of two worlds\", senses the imminent war between families and decides to move to Brazil, where he can follow his business in peace under the name of Roberto Felici. As he predicted, after his departure tensions begin and the first victims of the feud fall, including two of his sons and his brother. But Buscetta is captured and tortured by the Brazilian police. The mafioso understands that he is facing certain death when his extradition to Italy is agreed. Unexpectedly, judge Giovanni Falcone (Fausto Russo Alesi) offers him a way out: to collaborate with the police and the judiciary, enjoying the protection of the state. Buscetta, who for some time no longer recognizes himself in the violent and unscrupulous actions of the Cosa Nostra and linked to an idea of the mafia that protects poor people, decides to accept, also to take revenge for the reprisals and persecutions against him and his family. He thus becomes the first justice collaborator in Italian history, making possible the institution in 1986 of the Maxi-Trial with 475 defendants in the bunker-court of Palermo, where his testimonies - and those of Totuccio Contorno (Luigi Lo Cascio) - lead to the condemnation and arrest of numerous members of the mafia, put to the test for the first time and in the spotlight of the state and public opinion. Organized crime will respond with the assassination of Judge Falcone in 1992 in the attack known as the \"Capaci massacre\", where in addition to the magistrate, his wife Francesca Morvillo and three escort agents lost their lives. Buscetta, under protection in the United States, will return to Italy to honor the pact with Falcone and testify in the so-called \"trial of the century\", which involved Giulio Andreotti, the main exponent of the Christian Democrats and a great protagonist of Italian politics in the second half of the 1900s, and numerous other politicians, thus bringing to light the strong ties between the state and the Mafia.",

The rival gang wanted revenge on Red Hair and Zhou and set a trap for them. Red Hair is killed by the trap, decapitating him, and Zhou is shot twice in the torso. While trying to escape in the rain, Zhou accidentally shot and killed a policeman, mistaking him for the rival gang. Meanwhile, the police deduce he will hide at Wild Goose Lake; a lawless area of Wuhan, and set a dragnet there for him. The leader of the police is Captain Liu (Liao Fan). The police have Shujun under surveillance. Zhou had sought out Huahua, an associate he trusts, to get his wife Shujin so that they can leave together. Huahua is a pimp at Wild Goose Lake and Liu Aiai is one of his \"bathing beauties\" who service customers at the lake. Liu Aiai who is not known to the police is used as a middle person by Huahua. The police offer a 300,000 yuan, dead or alive, reward for Zhou. When Zhou learns of the reward he wants Liu to arrange for his wife to turn him in so that his wife can collect the reward. Huahua is interested in collecting the reward for himself. Meanwhile the rival gang is also looking to collect the reward and kill Zhou in the process. Zhou is eventually trapped by the rival gang in an apartment and stabbed by the rival gang members who shot him earlier, however Zhou is able to kill them and escape. The police hear the gunshots from the rival gang (who kill a passerby in the process) and start actively searching the streets for Zhou. Liu believes that Zhou suspects her of betraying him and tries to run away from him. In trying to escape Liu runs into Yan who recognizes her as one of Huahua's prostitutes. Yan forces Liu into having sex and Zhou saves her by killing him. Zhou and Liu Aiai walk to the noodle shop and she orders two bowls of noodles. While settling the bill with the noodle shop owner, the police arrive and trap Zhou in the shop. Zhou is able to shoot his way out but becomes cornered by the lake where he is shot several times before succumbing to his injuries. Liu Aiai later collects the reward and is driven by the Captain Liu to the bank with the cash. While getting cigarettes the Captain sees her leave the bank with the money. He follows her and sees her meeting up with Zhou's wife Shujun.",

    "Synopsis": "Rahim Soltani is temporarily released from prison for a two-day period in order to settle an unpaid debt of 150,000,000 tomans to Bahram. Rahim's lover, Farkondeh, has acquired a lost handbag containing several gold coins, which they both attempt to sell in order to repay the debt, but find that gold has lost value to the point where Rahim cannot repay Bahram in full. In the meantime, he moves in with his sister Malileh and her husband Hossein. Malileh discovers the handbag and coins and confronts Rahim about it, leading Rahim to pursue the original owner of the handbag and return it to them. After the original owner comes to claim the bag (which Rahim claims he found), Rahim is praised for his selfless act and his story is covered by the media before he returns to prison and becomes a local celebrity. Bahram is immediately suspicious of Rahim's story, believing he is trying to restore his image and leave prison to stop the impending second marriage of his ex-wife. The prison begins to arrange for Rahim's release. At a charity event to raise money and provide employment for Rahim, Bahram is incensed to learn that less than a quarter of the debt's total has been raised. He explains to the organizers that Rahim, then unable to take out a loan from a bank, received the money from Bahram that he acquired from a loan shark, who he eventually had to repay when Rahim failed to make payments. Despite this, Bahram agrees to have Rahim released for the sake of his estranged son, Siavash. While applying for his new job, Rahim learns that rumors have begun to spread disputing his supposed discovery and returning of the handbag, prompting Rahim to locate the woman in order for her to confirm his story, though his search is fruitless. Rahim and Malileh plot to have Farkondeh pose as the woman, using details from the actual encounter to validate Rahim's story. The hiring manager produces a text from Rahim to Bahram offering to pay half the debt a week before the day he claimed to have found the bag, leading him to reject Rahim's application. Certain that Bahram forwarded the incriminating text exchange, Rahim confronts him at his printing shop, but Bahram denies it. After Bahram accuses Rahim of using his son for sympathy, Rahim physically attacks him, and nearby shopkeepers help restrain Rahim while the police arrive. Farkondeh arrives and manages to convince Bahram to let Rahim go. Rahim is called by the charity organization to inform him of a video made by Bahram's daughter Nazanin, which shows footage of his fight with Bahram while also unveiling his and Farkondeh's relationship. Nazanin threatens to release the video publicly if Rahim doesn't pay his debt in full by the next day. In light of this evidence, Rahim is forced to unveil the truth about the bag. Fearing a scandal, the organization decides to withhold the money raised for Rahim. On the last day of his leave, Rahim is informed by the charity organizer that the funds raised for him will instead be used toward the release of a man scheduled to be executed, and Farkondeh convinces her to tell the media that it was Rahim's idea in order to help him retain some of his honor. Nazanin's video is released, and Farkondeh's family forbids her from seeing Rahim again. While filming a video about Rahim's most recent “act” of charity to soften the backlash, Siavash is coached into crying on camera by Rahim's parole officer, Salehi, and Rahim, wanting to protect his son, relents and wishes for the video to not be released. When Salehi refuses, Rahim fights him outside until he eventually deletes it. The following morning, Farkondeh and Siavash accompany Rahim back to prison to serve the remainder of his sentence.",

    "Synopsis": "After a swift courtship, provocative stand-up comedian Henry McHenry publicly declares his engagement to world-famous soprano Ann Desfranoux. Shortly afterwards, Ann gives birth to their daughter Annette, portrayed by a wooden marionette puppet. The marriage becomes rocky when Henry begins to take care of Annette while Ann's career flourishes and takes her overseas. Later, Ann has dreams about six women who come forward with allegations of past abuse at the hands of Henry and nightmares about Henry almost killing her. Back home, Henry's career begins to spiral, exacerbated by an onstage meltdown, and he comes to resent Ann's continued success. The two schedule a private cruise with the goal of mending their relationship. However, the cruise ends in disaster when Ann falls overboard during a stormy night after Henry drunkenly forces her to waltz with him. After realizing that his wife is dead, Henry and Annette get to an island using a lifeboat. There, both fall asleep, when Ann's ghost suddenly appears and gives her voice to infant Annette as a form of revenge, so she can haunt Henry. Though cleared of legal suspicion for Ann's death, Henry finds himself at a financial dead-end without her income. He contacts Ann's former accompanist, revealing Annette's singing voice and suggesting they use her gift for a musical act. The accompanist reluctantly agrees, having been in love with Ann, and as they tour, Baby Annette becomes a worldwide hit. Henry continues to drink heavily and stay out late, haunted by memories of Ann. One night, when returning home, Henry overhears Annette singing a rendition of “We Love Each Other So Much”, which was Ann and Henry's song. He confronts the accompanist, who implies that he is Annette's real father. In retaliation, Henry drowns him in the backyard pool, witnessed by Annette from her bedroom window. Henry plans one final performance at the \"Hyperbowl\" halftime show, but Annette refuses to sing, instead declaring, \"Daddy kills people,\" to the packed stadium. Henry is tried and convicted. A few years later, Annette visits her father in prison. Annette, suddenly portrayed by a living human girl, denies his attempts of reconciliation and even blames her mother for using her to get revenge. She tells him that he now has \"nothing to love\". After the living Annette leaves, the Annette puppet lies lifeless on the floor.",

    "film_title": "Benedetta (film)",
    "Synopsis": "In 17th-century Pescia, Italy, young Benedetta Carlini is enrolled by her parents in a Theatine convent run by Abbess Felicita, to become a nun. Eighteen years later, while playing the Virgin Mary in a play, Benedetta has a vision of Jesus calling to her. One day, a young peasant woman named Bartolomea seeks shelter in the convent from her abusive father. Benedetta is assigned to oversee Bartolomea's integration into convent life. That night, Bartolomea kisses Benedetta. Benedetta begins to have recurring visions of Jesus. After a particularly fraught vision, where a man whom she mistakes for Jesus saves her from being gang-raped, Benedetta falls into a deep illness. Felicita assigns Bartolomea to look after her. Benedetta has another vision of Christ, asking her to undress and touch his hands. The next morning, she wakes up with stigmata on her palms and feet. An investigation ensues. Felicita is sceptical because Benedetta's stigmata manifested while she was asleep, not during prayer, and her forehead lacks the marks of a crown of thorns. Outside Felicita's chambers, Benedetta collapses. She then begins speaking in an angry male voice, castigating those who doubt her, as bleeding wounds appear on her forehead. Sister Christina, Felicita's daughter, suspects that Benedetta's wounds are self-inflicted, after spotting a nearby shard of glass. Following a dispute between Felicita and local church leaders about the way popular interest in Benedetta's visions should be handled, Benedetta is elevated to the position of abbess in place of Felicita. Benedetta and Bartolomea move into Felicita's old quarters and begin a sexual relationship, later using a dildo carved by Bartolomea out of Benedetta's wooden Virgin Mary statuette. In confession, Christina lies to the priest that she witnessed Benedetta inflicting her forehead wounds. The next day, the priest compels Christina to say her accusations publicly. When questioned by the priest, Felicita refutes Christina's claims because Christina has previously admitted to her that she did not actually see the wounds being self-inflicted. Benedetta, apparently possessed by the spirit of Jesus, orders Christina to flagellate herself. Felicita later observes Benedetta and Bartolomea having sex in their chambers through a peephole. Humiliated, Christina jumps to her death from the roof of the convent. As a plague begins to ravage the countryside, Benedetta has a vision that Pescia will be spared and orders the abbey closed to prevent infection. Felicita secretly travels to Florence to report Benedetta's sexual indiscretions to the local papal nuncio. Meanwhile, Benedetta suddenly dies of unknown causes. Shortly after Felicita returns to the abbey with the nuncio, Benedetta revives, saying that she was in heaven and has seen the fates of all those present. The nuncio, as representative of the pope, opens a court of inquiry into Benedetta's conduct. Bartolomea initially denies any sexual involvement with Benedetta, but after being tortured by the nuncio's men, she ultimately confesses the truth, leading the nuncio to the wooden dildo hidden in a cutout section of a large book. He has Benedetta arrested; speaking in a male voice again, she lashes out at those who persecute her, announcing that the nuncio will soon fall ill. The nuncio discovers that Felicita has the plague and orders her condition to be hidden. Bartolomea is expelled from the abbey. In the town square, before she is to be executed, Benedetta reveals new stigmata and, speaking in a male voice, announces that the Angel of Death approaches. Felicita, revealing her disease, blames the nuncio for bringing the plague to Pescia. Chaos ensues as the townspeople prevent the nuncio's men from burning Benedetta at the stake. Bartolomea unties Benedetta, discovering a bloody potsherd at her feet. The nuncio is killed by an angry mob, Benedetta and Bartolomea flee the town, and Felicita self-immolates on the fire lit for Benedetta's execution. In an abandoned stable outside of town, after spending the night with Bartolomea, Benedetta insists that she must return to the convent. Bartolomea begs her to stay and tries to get her to admit that she faked her stigmata, but Benedetta refuses and instead heads back towards Pescia. An epilogue reveals that Benedetta lived in the abbey until her death at the age of 70, and that the plague spared Pescia.",

    "film_title": "Bergman Island (2021 film)",
    "Synopsis": "A filmmaking couple, Chris and Tony Sanders, travel to Fårö, the island where Ingmar Bergman lived and worked, to attend a film screening. Tony is an admirer of Bergman and is inspired by the island. Chris struggles with a dislike for Bergman for his personal failings, specifically in how he treated the women in his life and as a father, despite loving his movies. During the Q&A after a screening of Tony's film, Chris sneaks out. At the church where Bergman is buried she meets Hampus, a Swedish film student also participating in a residency. She decides to take him up on his offer to explore the island, leaving Tony to take the touristy Bergman Safari alone. The next day after Chris realizes how productive Tony has found his time on the island she reveals she is struggling with her work and has only a rough outline. She decides to share her work with Tony, hoping he can help her. Tony isn't at his desk in a neighboring cottage, so Chris sneaks a look at Tony's journal. She discovers that Tony has hand drawn a number of provocative and abusive pictures of female figures in painful, subjugated positions. In the screenplay Chris is writing, Amy (Mia Wasikowska), an American filmmaker in her late 20s, is travelling to Fårö for the wedding of a friend. Another one of the guests is a man named Joseph (Anders Danielsen Lie). Amy and Joseph had a love affair as teens and then rekindled their relationship as adults before breaking up once more. During the pre-wedding celebrations they spend the day together and then, after the wedding, go skinny dipping before having sex. The two discuss still being in love with each other despite both being in relationships and loving other people. Amy is crushed when she realizes that Joseph has been repeatedly unfaithful to his girlfriend. The following morning Joseph expresses regret that they slept together while Amy is unrepentant. Amy tries to continue their affair during the brief time they have left but Joseph repeatedly brushes her off. After asking if he can see her in her room on the final night, Joseph fails to come and Amy later learns he left the island without telling her. Amy returns to her rented home and Chris confesses this is where she is stuck on her screenplay offering the morbid idea that Amy could possibly attempt suicide. Several times during Chris' telling Tony interrupts Chris, takes phone calls, or is otherwise disengaged, and ultimately says he can't help her with the ending. Tony leaves Fårö to collect their daughter June and bring her to the island. Chris heads to her study to work on her screenplay. Chris travels to the Bergman Estate and runs into Hampus on his way out. He leaves her the key and she falls asleep. She is woken up by Anders Danielsen Lie who reveals that despite wrapping up his scenes for the day he has stayed in order to see Bergman's house. He expresses disappointment Chris did not write a scene in which he could appear in Bergman's house and Chris shows him the library. Later they attend a dinner with Mia Wasikowska. Anders Danielsen Lie and Chris play a game of Ludo late into the night. He thanks her for casting him in her movie before encouraging her to go to sleep before the busy day ahead. Tony returns to the island with June, who reunites with Chris at a windmill on Bergman's property.",

    "Synopsis": "Stage actor and director Yūsuke Kafuku lives in Tokyo with his wife Oto, a screenwriter who conceives her stories after sex and narrates them to him. He learns his lines by listening to tapes recorded by Oto, while driving his red Saab 900 Turbo. After Yūsuke performs in Waiting for Godot, Oto introduces him to young television star Kōji Takatsuki. When a theater festival Yūsuke was slated to judge in is delayed, he returns home, where he finds his wife having sex with Kōji, but does not disturb them. After a car crash, Yūsuke discovers he has glaucoma in one eye and must take eyedrops to prevent blindness. One day, Oto asks to have a serious conversation with Yūsuke. After he spends the day driving alone, Yūsuke returns home to find Oto dead from a brain hemorrhage. After the funeral, Yūsuke breaks down while performing the title role in Uncle Vanya. Two years later, Yūsuke accepts a residency in Hiroshima to direct a multilingual production of Uncle Vanya. The theatre festival requires that he be chauffeured in his own car for insurance reasons, and despite his initial reluctance, he eventually bonds with his reserved young driver, Misaki Watari. With the help of dramaturge Gong Yoon-su, Yūsuke casts a diverse group of actors to perform in their native languages. He is impressed by Lee Yoo-na, a mute actress who communicates in Korean Sign Language, and he also unexpectedly casts Kōji as Uncle Vanya. After a rehearsal, Kōji invites Yūsuke for a drink, where the young actor pushes against harsh assessments of his character but admits to his unrequited love for Oto. He scolds someone for taking a photo of him. Yoon-su invites Yūsuke and Misaki to dinner with his wife, who is revealed to be Yoo-na. Driving home, Misaki tells Yūsuke about driving her abusive mother for long hours at a young age. They later visit a garbage facility, where Misaki explains that she drove garbage trucks after leaving her hometown when a landslide destroyed her home and killed her mother. Drinking with Kōji again, Yūsuke reveals that he thinks he can no longer play Vanya himself, and suggests that Kōji's lack of self-control is a personal weakness but a strength as an actor. After Kōji slips away to confront a man taking photos of him, Misaki drives them home. Yūsuke reveals that he and Oto lost their young daughter, who would now be Misaki's age; Oto's gift for telling stories after sex was a bond that helped them both cope. Though he knew of his wife's affairs, Yūsuke believes she still loved him, and Kōji shares one of Oto's stories that Yūsuke never heard in its entirety. The police interrupt a rehearsal and arrest Kōji, as the man he attacked has died from his injuries. Given two days to consider whether to take over as Vanya or else cancel the production, Yūsuke asks Misaki to take him to her childhood home in Hokkaido. Yūsuke shares his guilt for not coming home to face the discussion Oto wanted to have, which might have allowed him to save her life. Misaki reveals that she escaped the landslide but chose not to pull her mother from the wreckage, receiving a scar on her cheek she has chosen not to have treated. They visit the snowy remains of Misaki's childhood home and hug as they both confront their shared grief. Yūsuke assumes the role of Vanya and gives an impassioned performance before a live audience, including Misaki. Yoo-na meaningfully delivers Sonya's final lines: \"We shall hear the angels, we shall see the whole sky all in diamonds, we shall see how all earthly evil, all our sufferings, are drowned in the mercy that will fill the whole world. And our life will grow peaceful, tender, sweet as a caress… You've had no joy in your life; but wait, Uncle Vanya, wait… We shall rest.\" Actors and audience alike are moved by the performance. Some time later, Misaki is living in South Korea. Buying groceries, she returns to Yūsuke's red Saab, in which a dog rests. She takes off her surgical mask, revealing that her scar is now barely visible, and drives away.",

She's upset, remembering how he was constantly critical of her as a girl, and feels he's bullying her again. Euthanasia is illegal in France so she contacts a Swiss clinic that carries out such procedures: when she meets one of the staff, it's emphasised that he must take a fatal glass of lethal drugs himself - they can prepare it but will not actively kill him. As Emmanuèle and her sister Pascale make plans to get him across the border into Switzerland, he says farewell to friends. But his cousin Simone, who survived a death camp during the war, pleads with him not to throw away his life. A former lover, the unhinged Gérard, who also wants him to live, demands to see him in hospital: André eventually allows Gérard to visit, but remains obdurate in his wish to die. However, as they prepare to take him away, the sisters are called in by the police, who have been informed (by Gérard) of their plan. They're released, and sneak their father into an ambulance - though in a further complication, one of the drivers is a Muslim and unwilling to take part.

    "Synopsis": "France de Meurs (Léa Seydoux) is the star reporter for a popular French TV news show. Thanks to her charm and hard-hitting reports from war zones, she plays the role of a hard hitting and honest reporter. However, when we see the other side of the shots on location, we realize that her concern is not only the strict journalistic truth, but also the staging of sequences that show her off to best advantage. She is constantly pushed in this direction by Lou (Blanche Gardin), her cynical assistant. She's married to Fred, an author, and has a son, Jojo, but her relationship with them is very strained, her work taking up most of her time. One morning, while driving her son to school, France knocks down a young man on a scooter. The event is immediately exploited by social networks, and she realizes how fragile her popularity is. Sincerely affected by the fate of Baptiste, whom she has sent to hospital, she goes to visit him and decides to help his family, against her husband's advice. She then sinks into depression and decides to leave the news channel. She heads off to Bavaria, to a health resort in the heart of the snow-capped mountains, where she meets Charles Castro, a young man undergoing treatment. They begin an affair, and France is relieved to meet someone who doesn't know of her fame. However, she discovers that Charles is an unscrupulous journalist who has tricked her into falling in love with him for a magazine piece he is writing on her. Although the young man tells her he's really fallen in love with her, she violently rejects him. Back in Paris, she resumes her job at the station, and endures harassment from Charles, who has become obsessed with her. She is not really cured of her depression. The sudden death of her husband and son in a car accident takes its toll on her, but strangely enough, after hitting rock bottom, she realizes that her previous problems were rather trivial, and decides to give Charles another chance, as he may be the only one left she can turn to.",

    "Synopsis": "Jessica, a Scottish expatriate to Colombia, awakens one night to a single loud boom. She appears to be the only one who heard it. The next day, she goes to visit her sister, Karen, who is ill and in a hospital in Bogotá. Jessica operates a market-flower business in Medellín, and is curious to learn more about an excavation project being carried out in the same hospital where her sister is being treated. Still bothered by the sound, which she hears repeatedly and which prevents her from sleeping, Jessica seeks the help of a young sound engineer named Hernán to recreate the sound. Though unsuccessful at first, the two eventually approximate the sound, and begin a friendly relationship. Right before they are to take a trip together, Jessica looks for Hernán at his sound engineering studio, only to discover that he is not there and no one working there knows who he is. Finding herself growing increasingly uncomfortable while in the company of her now-healthy sister, Jessica ventures out into the countryside alone, where she encounters a middle-aged fish scaler, also named Hernán. This Hernán lives a secluded life, but he speaks frankly with Jessica. They discuss his connection to the earth, his sleep, and their memories. Inside his home, Jessica learns to connect with her memories in a similar fashion to Hernán, and at one point while holding hands, appears to have her memories intertwine with his. Jessica then approaches an open window and hears the booming sound again, but seems to have grown to accept it and even appreciate it. Suddenly, a camouflaged alien spacecraft rises out of the jungle, leaving a loud sonic boom in its wake. A radio broadcast is heard reporting a mild earthquake that, unbeknownst to the general population, coincided with the take-off of the spacecraft. The broadcast goes on to say that the quake has unearthed previously inaccessible areas that the aforementioned excavation project was searching for.",

    "film_title": "Nitram",
    "Synopsis": "The film begins with real archive news footage from 1979 of a 12-year-old Martin Bryant being interviewed in a burns unit of a hospital after playing with fireworks. He is asked whether he has learned his lesson not to play with them again; he replies that he would play with them again. Nitram is an intellectually disabled young adult who lives with his parents in Tasmania. He regularly sets off fireworks, which upsets the neighbours, and sells his fireworks to schoolchildren. His father has recently been approved for a business loan with which he hopes to buy a bed and breakfast that Nitram will help run. Nitram begs his mother to buy him a surfboard after seeing an attractive woman with a surfer, but she is exasperated and refuses. Nitram starts mowing lawns to make money. In the process, he meets a neighbour named Helen, a retired actress and heiress, who offers to pay him to walk her dogs. The two quickly become friends, and Helen buys him a car, despite Nitram not having a driver's licence and exhibiting a dangerous habit of grabbing the steering wheel when the two are driving. Nitram becomes increasingly frustrated with life at home and tells his parents he is moving in with Helen, who permits him to stay in a spare room but insists that he get rid of his air rifle as it upsets her. On his next birthday, Nitram introduces Helen to his parents; his mother tells Helen an anecdote about a young Nitram taking pleasure in the pain he caused her after pretending to be lost. Despite having the funds for the bed and breakfast, Nitram's father's offer is rejected when another couple makes a higher offer, and he becomes despondent. Nitram asks Helen if the two can visit Hollywood, Los Angeles, but on the drive to the airport the next day he once again lunges for the steering wheel, resulting in a devastating car crash that kills Helen and severely injures him. When questioned by police, Nitram lies that he was asleep at the time of the crash. Nitram, having inherited Helen's decaying mansion and over half a million dollars, starts to drink heavily. His mother asks him to help his father, who is severely depressed. Nitram then desperately attempts to buy the bed and breakfast, but the new owners flatly refuse. Several days later, his father's body is found in a nearby river after an apparent suicide. After he shows up to his father's funeral dressed in an electric blue suit and hat, Nitram's mother refuses to let him attend, fearing he will embarrass her. The increasingly isolated Nitram begins to take frequent overseas vacations by himself and practises shooting with his air rifle. While watching the news one night, Nitram sees a report about the Dunblane massacre. He then becomes obsessed with guns, purchasing an unlicensed Colt AR-15 and shotgun and ordering a handgun. One day, he drives to the bed and breakfast his father wanted to buy and shoots the owners in an act of revenge, then drives to the café where Helen and his parents celebrated his birthday. After ordering food, he sets up a video camera, retrieves a rifle from his sports bag and opens fire on the tourists. At her home, Nitram's mother smokes, while the news report of the massacre played in the background.",

    "Synopsis": "Émilie, a call center operator for a phone service provider, is living in an apartment in the Les Olympiades complex belonging to her terminally ill grandmother. Facing difficulties making rent, she places advertisements for a roommate, to which Camille, a teacher returning to university for his doctoral degree, responds. Émilie is initially hesitant to rent to a man, but the two quickly develop a sexual relationship. They each agree that they are uninterested in becoming a couple, but Émilie develops feelings for Camille and becomes frustrated when he refuses to have sex with her one night. The next day, they decide to stop having sex, and Camille romantically pursues a co-worker. When he invites that co-worker over, Émilie goes to a party, takes MDMA, sleeps with a woman, and then has an anxiety attack after returning to her apartment and overhearing Camille having sex with his partner. Émilie takes her jealousy and frustration (having recently lost her job) out on Camille, who decides to move in with his partner. Attending the same university as Camille is Nora, a 33-year-old in the second year of her undergraduate law degree. She spent most of her early adulthood working for a real estate firm owned by her uncle by marriage, with whom she had a ten-year sexual relationship. Nora has few friends and finds it difficult to relate to her younger classmates. She impulsively buys a blonde wig and attends an energetic college party wearing the wig. At the party, she is mistaken for well-known camgirl Amber Sweet, who wears a similar wig, and is harassed by fellow students until she leaves the party. The next day, Nora is mocked by students in her class who think she is Amber; she drops out shortly afterwards. Needing a job, Nora applies for a position in a small real estate firm that happens to be managed by Camille, who has since broken up with his former co-worker and taken over the firm from a relative to supplement his income. Nora decides to set platonic boundaries between herself and Camille, but eventually becomes attracted to him, and they enter into a relationship. Camille re-establishes a prickly friendship with Émilie, who has since become a waiter. Camille asks Émilie for advice with his current relationship, but her love for him makes her unable to broach the subject. Meanwhile, Nora tracks Amber down and buys camming time with her to discuss the incident of mistaken identity. Over the course of many video chats, they become close friends. Nora and Camille's relationship becomes strained, and they eventually part ways after a sexual encounter in which Nora dominates Camille. On the same night, Émilie's grandmother dies. When Émilie tells Camille that she feels unable to face her family at the funeral on the coming Sunday, Camille offers to accompany her. Émilie is angered by this offer and asks Camille to either attend the funeral (and thus commit to a relationship with her) or else cut contact with her. That Sunday, Nora and Amber meet in a park. Nora faints after greeting Amber, and then asks her to kiss her. In Les Olympiades, Émilie is preparing to attend the funeral alone when her apartment phone rings; it is Camille waiting for her. Émilie asks Camille to explain why he has come until Camille admits that he loves her. She then hangs up the phone to join Camille outside.",

    "Synopsis": "Washed up and down-on-his-luck L. A. pornstar Mikey \"Saber\" Davies returns to his hometown of Texas City, Texas for the first time in 17 years to start over. After a two-day busride and with $22 on him, he arrives at the modest home of his estranged wife and fellow ex-pornstar, Lexi, to whom he is still married on paper, and her mother, Lil, begging them to let him stay. They reluctantly agree but insist that he get a job and do household chores. Over the course of the day, Mikey has several job interviews, but due to the long gap in his resume and his fame as an adult film actor, nobody hires him. Desperate, he reaches out to Leondria, the drug dealer mother of an old schoolmate, to give him back his old job selling marijuana for her. Leondria and her daughter June suspect that Mikey will smoke it himself, but their business arrangement continues after he returns with his earnings. Since he doesn't have a car, he moves around on Lexi's old kids bicycle. After sleeping on the couch for several nights, Mikey starts having sex with Lexi. Eventually, she invites him to share her bedroom again. Mikey gives Lexi and Lil a month's rent in advance and takes them to a donut shop to celebrate. He becomes smitten with Raylee, a 17-year-old girl who works at the counter and goes by the name Strawberry. He returns and persuades her to let him sell marijuana to the construction workers who frequent the shop. They soon start a sexual relationship. One night, after sex, she plays him a piano version of \"Bye Bye Bye\" by NSYNC. Mikey also befriends Lexi's neighbor Lonnie, whom Lexi used to babysit, when he was younger. They spend some time together, but during a visit to the mall, Mikey learns that Lonnie is pretending to be an Army veteran to sell US flags and witnesses him getting humiliated and thrown into the mall fountain by two actual veterans, who see through him. Mikey persuades Strawberry to break up with Nash, her high school boyfriend, after finding out she was not single when they met. Nash and his parents confront Mikey in the donut shop parking lot and beat him up. Mikey repeatedly tries to persuade Strawberry to travel with him to Los Angeles to pursue a career in pornography, which he plans on managing and which is his way back into the business. They grow closer, causing him to become distant from Lexi. When he disappears for a weekend with Strawberry, Lexi grows suspicious and they argue. Mikey berates her and brags about the $3,000 he made selling drugs. While riding in Lonnie's car, Mikey brags about his success with Strawberry and his comeback, which distracts Lonnie and makes him almost miss their exit, causing them to swerve across traffic, creating a multiple-vehicle collision which results in several injuries, but which they avoid. They flee the scene and Mikey begs Lonnie to hide his involvement. Mikey is anxious, but Lonnie assumes full responsibility for the crash when he is arrested. Using the crash as an excuse, Mikey visits Strawberry at work and asks her to come to Los Angeles with him and start her porn career. She agrees and quits her job. That night, Mikey tells Lexi that he is leaving for Los Angeles in the morning. That night, Lexi and Lil convince Leondria to send her adult children, June and her brothers, to seize the $3,000 that Mikey earned from selling her pot. They confront him while he is sleeping and take the money. Mikey flees naked out of the bedroom window and he runs to Leondria's house, begging her to return his money. Explaining that he is being punished for selling her marijuana to the unionized construction workers, she gives Mikey $200 and tells him to leave or be beaten up. Humiliated, he leaves with a few possessions in a trash bag. After traveling all night on foot to Strawberry's house, he imagines seeing her dressed in a bikini in her doorway as his eyes well with tears.",

    "film_title": "The French Dispatch",
    "Synopsis": "In 1975, in the fictional French town of Ennui-sur-Blasé, Arthur Howitzer Jr., the editor of the magazine The French Dispatch, dies of a heart attack. According to the wishes expressed in his will, publication of the magazine is immediately suspended following one final farewell issue, in which four articles are published, along with an obituary. Herbsaint Sazerac delivers a cycling tour of Ennui-sur-Blasé, demonstrating several key areas such as the arcade, Le Sans Blague café and a pickpocket's alleyway. He compares the past and the present of each place, demonstrating how much and yet how little has changed in Ennui over time. J. K. L. Berensen delivers a lecture at the art gallery of her former employer, Upshur \"Maw\" Clampette, in which she details the career of Moses Rosenthaler. Rosenthaler, a mentally disturbed artist serving a 50-year sentence in the Ennui prison for double murder, paints an abstract nude portrait of Simone, a guard with whom he develops a relationship. Julien Cadazio, an art dealer also serving time for tax evasion, is immediately taken by the painting and buys it despite Rosenthaler's protests. Upon his release, Cadazio convinces his family of art exhibitors to put it on display, and Rosenthaler soon becomes a sensation in the art world. Privately, Rosenthaler struggles with inspiration to the point of near-suicide, and devotes himself to a long-term project at Simone's challenging. Three years later, Cadazio, his uncles, Clampette, Berensen, and a mob of artists inspired by Rosenthaler, all frustrated at the lack of further paintings, bribe their way into the prison to confront him, only to discover that his masterpiece is in fact a series of frescoes in the concrete prison hall. Angered that the paintings are irremovable from the prison, Cadazio gets into a physical altercation with Rosenthaler, but soon comes to appreciate the paintings for what they are, and later arranges for the entire wall to be airlifted out of the prison into a private museum in Kansas, owned by Clampette. For his actions in halting a prison riot that breaks out during the reveal of the paintings, Rosenthaler is released on probation. Simone also departs after earning a great sum of money for becoming the inspiration and motivation for Rosenthaler during his incarceration. Simone and Rosenthaler maintain correspondence following his release, but never see each other again. Lucinda Krementz reports on a student protest breaking out in the streets of Ennui that soon boils over into the \"Chessboard Revolution\", so-called for the students using chess to communicate with the police. While the revolution initially is inspired by petty concerns over access to the girls' dormitory, the traumatic military conscription of one student, Mitch-Mitch, inspires greater uprising. Despite her insistence on maintaining \"journalistic neutrality\", Krementz has a brief romance with Zeffirelli, a self-styled leader of the revolt, and secretly helps him write his manifesto and adds an appendix. Juliette, a fellow revolutionary, is unimpressed with his manifesto. After they briefly express their disagreement about its contents, Krementz discovers that Juliette is in fact infatuated with Zeffirelli and is jealous of her closeness with him. She then tells the two to \"go make love\", which they do. A few weeks later, Zeffirelli dies attempting repairs on the tower of a revolutionary pirate radio station, and soon a photograph of his likeness becomes symbolic of the movement. Five years later, Krementz translates Mitch-Mitch's theatrical dramatization of his conscription, and Zeffirelli's death, for a National Playhouse production of his play (at the downstairs Knoblock Theatre). During a television interview, Roebuck Wright recounts the story of his attending a private dinner with The Commissaire of the Ennui police force, prepared by legendary police officer/chef Lt. Nescaffier. Nescaffier is a famous specialist in a kind of haute cuisine specifically designed to be eaten by working police officers. The dinner is disrupted when the Commissaire's son Gigi is kidnapped and held for ransom by criminals, led by a failed musician labelled The Chauffeur. The kidnappers represent the warring criminal syndicates of Ennui-sur-Blasé, and demand the release of an underworld accountant Albert, nicknamed \"the Abacus\", who possesses their shared financial records. The Abacus is being held in a solitary confinement cell at police headquarters. Wright recollects his own imprisonment in that same cell for his homosexuality, for which he was bailed out by Howitzer and offered a job at the Dispatch. Following a shoot-out at the kidnapper's hideout, Gigi manages to sneak out a message in Morse code to \"send the cook\". Lt. Nescaffier is sent into the kidnappers' hideout, ostensibly to provide both them and Gigi with food, but secretly the food is laced with poison. The criminals all succumb to the poison except Gigi and The Chauffeur as neither ate the poisoned radishes, and Nescaffier just barely survives after willingly sampling the food to trick the criminals. The Chauffeur escapes with Gigi, and leads the police on a chase. Gigi manages to escape through the car's sunroof and reunites with his father. During his recovery, Nescaffier saves The Abacus from starving to death by preparing him an omelette, the prisoner having been totally forgotten in the commotion. Back at the Dispatch office, Howitzer tells Wright to reinsert a deleted segment. In it, a recovering Nescaffier tells Wright that the taste of the poison was unlike anything he had ever eaten before, before they reflect on the state of being foreigners in France, and outsiders to society as a whole. Howitzer and Wright disagree on whether this conversation is the heart of the piece. In an epilogue, the French Dispatch staff mourn Howitzer's death, but set to work putting together a final issue to honor his memory. During the closing credits, there is a dedication to the following writers and editors, many of whom were associated with The New Yorker: Harold Ross, William Shawn, Rosamond Bernier, Mavis Gallant, James Baldwin, A. J. Liebling, S. N. Behrman, Lillian Ross, Janet Flanner, Lucy Sante, James Thurber, Joseph Mitchell, Wolcott Gibbs, St. Clair McKelway, Ved Mehta, Brendan Gill, E. B. White, and Katharine White, and additionally to Christophe, writer of the featured song \"Aline\". Accompanying the credits are covers of the French Dispatch which are reminiscent of The New Yorker covers.",

In her late twenties, she begins a relationship with Aksel Willman, a comic artist fifteen years her senior. Now exploring writing, she spends a weekend with Aksel at his parents' house. Aksel suggests starting a family, but Julie is uncertain. While walking home from a publishing event for Aksel, Julie crashes a wedding reception and meets Eivind, a barista. Despite both being in relationships, they spend the night together sharing jokes and intimacies, but refrain from sexual relations. They exchange only their first names before parting ways. Julie writes a short story about feminism and oral sex, impressing Aksel, who encourages her to post it online. It gains attention. She celebrates her thirtieth birthday at her divorced mother's home, but her father fails to attend, citing back pain. Days later, Julie's half-sister inadvertently reveals that their father was actually watching her play at a football tournament on Julie's birthday. He makes excuses to decline Aksel's invitation to visit them in Oslo. While working at a bookstore, Julie encounters Eivind and his girlfriend Sunniva. During dinner with Aksel's brother and sister-in-law, Aksel complains about the sanitized cinematic adaptation of his politically incorrect comic series Bobcat (Gaupe in Norwegian), leaving Julie feeling bored and ignored. The next morning she daydreams about spending the day with Eivind, imagining falling in love. That same day she ends her relationship with Aksel. Eivind breaks up with the obsessively social-justice-and-climate-conscious Sunniva due to her restrictive lifestyle. Julie and Eivind move in together. At a small party Eivind hosts, one of his friends discovers Eivind's stash of psychedelic mushrooms, which Julie consumes, leading to hallucinations. The following night, Julie confides to Eivind that she feels comfortable being herself around him. Aksel's brother later runs into Julie at her workplace and reveals that Aksel has incurable pancreatic cancer. Sometime later, Eivind discovers a short story Julie wrote. Assuming it is autobiographical, he asks her about it, complimenting its writing. Still emotionally overwhelmed by the news about Aksel, she angrily denies it, patronizing him. Julie discovers she is pregnant and hesitates to tell Eivind. She visits Aksel in the hospital, where he expresses fear of dying but still professes his love for her. Julie tells him about her pregnancy, and although Aksel insists she would be a good mother, she remains scared. Upon returning home, she informs Eivind of her pregnancy, acknowledging neither of them wanted children and stating she needs time to decide whether to keep the child. She spends more time with Aksel as his condition deteriorates, visiting places from his childhood and photographing him. He laments about wishing to return to their old life together. Later, she receives a voicemail from Aksel's brother, informing her that Aksel is unlikely to survive the night. Julie walks through the streets that night and watches the sun rise, becoming overwhelmed with emotion over Aksel's presumed death. While showering, she experiences a miscarriage. Some time later, Julie works as an on-set photographer at a film shoot. She photographs an actress and later sees the actress outside with Eivind and a baby. Returning home, she begins editing the day's photos.",

    "Synopsis": "A little girl named Alexia annoys her father during a drive. As she removes her seatbelt, her father turns around to scold her, causing a car crash. Alexia suffers a skull injury and has a titanium plate fitted into her head. When she gets out of the hospital, she shuns her parents and embraces their car passionately. Years later, Alexia, now an adult with a large scar on the side of her head, works as a showgirl at a motor show. One night, after a show, a male fan follows Alexia in the showroom's parking lot, declares his love to her, and forcibly kisses her; she then brutally kills him using her large metal hair stick. As she returns to the showroom to shower, Alexia finds that the tuned Cadillac she modeled with earlier has turned on by itself. She enters it naked, has sex with the Cadillac, and climaxes. It is revealed that Alexia is a serial killer who has murdered three other men and a woman in the past few months. She still lives with her parents, who seem unaware of her connection with the crimes and with whom she has a distant relationship. Alexia attends a house party, where she starts to have sex with her coworker Justine. However, motor oil begins secreting from her vagina. She takes a pregnancy test, which returns a positive result, and tries to perform an abortion on the spot, using her hair stick, but fails. She comes out of the bathroom and murders Justine and two other men, but one woman manages to escape. Alexia returns home and tries to burn a bloodied blanket, which sets the house on fire. She locks her parents in their bedroom and leaves. Now wanted for murder, Alexia alters her appearance to pretend to be Adrien Legrand, a young boy who had disappeared ten years before, at age seven, by cutting her hair, taping down her breasts and pregnant belly, and breaking her own nose. She then goes to the police claiming that she is Adrien, where his father, Vincent, a fire captain, accepts Alexia as his missing son and refuses to do a DNA test. Vincent takes Alexia to the station where he lives and works, and introduces her to his men. The firefighters are puzzled by the mute, androgynous, and apparently traumatized \"Adrien\", but they refrain from questioning the captain's behavior. Alexia becomes an apprentice at the station, under Vincent's supervision. As Vincent gives more responsibility to his \"son\" over the other experienced firefighters, one firefighter confronts Vincent about \"Adrien's\" identity. However, Vincent immediately shuts him down and tells him to never speak of his son. Vincent tries to preserve his strength by injecting steroids into his aging body, but he finds that he seems to be building an immunity to them. Alexia is increasingly disturbed by his possessiveness and considers escaping from the fire station. However, after Vincent experiences an arrhythmia after injecting a large dose of steroids, Alexia decides to stay with him. Vincent's long-estranged ex-wife comes to see her \"son\", and ends up discovering a now-heavily pregnant Alexia without her body taped down. She nevertheless keeps the secret for herself, not wishing to interfere with her ex-husband's delusion, and begs Alexia to take care of him. Vincent eventually acknowledges his delusion, telling Alexia that \"whoever you are, you are my son.\" When he inadvertently uncovers her breasts, he is shocked but continues caring for her. At a party at the fire station, the firefighters urge \"Adrien\" to dance to the music. Alexia performs her showgirl choreography, confusing everyone. Vincent, disappointed, walks out of the crowd. After the party, Alexia has sex with a fire engine. Alexia's body gradually breaks down, as the skin of her stomach tears to reveal new metal plates. When her pregnancy comes to term, Alexia reveals her real name to Vincent, briefly attempting to seduce him and then begging for his help. Vincent helps Alexia give birth, the titanium side of her skull splitting open on her final push, killing her. The newborn's body appears with patches of titanium on its body. Vincent says repeatedly to the baby, \"I'm here.\"",

    "Synopsis": "In 1980 Queens, New York City, on his first day in sixth grade, Jewish-American Paul Graff becomes friends with a rebellious African-American classmate, Johnny Davis. Johnny was held back by a year and gets harsher treatment from their teacher when they both joke around in class. Paul often disassociates from his schoolwork and draws pictures instead. Paul lives with his financially stable family. He is close with his maternal grandfather, Aaron Rabinowitz, who encourages him to pursue his aspiration to become an artist. His well-meaning but strict parents, Esther and Irving, are less convinced of Paul's career prospects as an artist. At night, Aaron tells Paul the story of how Aaron's mother escaped antisemitic persecution in Ukraine, fleeing to London before eventually emigrating to the U.S. with Aaron and her British husband. One day, Paul and Johnny are caught smoking a joint in the restrooms, unaware that it's an illegal drug. Furious, Esther allows Irving to beat Paul as punishment. In the hope that he becomes more disciplined, Paul is sent to the Forest Manor Prep private school by his parents,<ref name=\"nationalreview/armageddon-time\" /> where his older brother Ted is studying. Meanwhile, Johnny stops going to school after being relegated to special education. Forest Manor is financially supported by famous businessman Fred Trump, who also supports Ronald Reagan in the upcoming presidential election. Many of the students are also Reagan supporters. On Paul's first day, Fred's daughter Maryanne, one of the school's famous alumni, gives a speech to the students about working to earn their success. Paul sees the school's advantages over his previous school but doesn't feel welcome. He is also unnerved by other students' racist comments when Johnny meets with him during recess. Johnny begins living in secret at Paul's clubhouse, having nowhere to go other than living with his sick grandmother, where foster system workers searching for Johnny have begun to visit regularly. While playing at the park on the weekend, Paul tells Aaron of his struggles at school and how he did nothing when he witnessed racism. Aaron encourages Paul to stand up against prejudice when he sees it, reminding him that while antisemitism still covertly persists, he and his family still have the privilege of being white. Shortly after, Aaron dies of bone cancer, with the family mourning his loss. Tired of living under high expectations from family and school, as well as the unfair treatment of Johnny, Paul convinces Johnny to steal a computer from school and sell it so they can run away together. After stealing the computer, they are arrested for trying to pawn it. While being interrogated, Paul confesses that it was all his plan. But knowing that he has no options in life, Johnny takes the blame to let Paul go, much to Paul's dismay. Paul and Johnny bid farewell, as Irving arrives to take him home with no consequences because Irving once did the interrogating officer a favor. At home, Irving confesses to Paul that he is sympathetic to his frustration with America's unfair racial inequality, but tells him that they need to survive to have a good life. The two agree to not tell Esther what happened, as she is still mourning her father. Days later, the Graff family are disappointed by Reagan's victory in the election, while Paul is focused on schoolwork. During a Thanksgiving dance at school, Fred Trump addresses the students, expressing hope that they'll become the next successful elite. A disillusioned Paul leaves during the speech.",

    "Synopsis": "Adam, the son of a fisherman from a village near El Manzala, accepts an offer to study at the prestigious Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt. Shortly after his arrival, the Grand Imam of al-Azhar suddenly dies and a power struggle to replace him ensues. The NSA (security service) strives to install sheikh Beblawi, but he has two competitors: neutral sheikh Negm, who is blind, and a Salafi sheikh Durani. Adam makes friends with Zizu, who is an informer for Colonel Ibrahim from the NSA. Zizu is soon killed, and Adam tries to help solve his murder by working for Ibrahim. He infiltrates a group of extremists and gathers information about them, but he learns that they had no involvement with the murder. Once the extremists realize his role, they attempt to kill Adam, but Ibrahim stops them and forces their leader to quit his position as Durani's assistant and turn it over to Adam. Sheikh Negm turns himself in to the NSA and claims that he killed Zizu. The NSA is forced to arrest him despite knowing that he is not guilty. While doing menial tasks for Durani, Adam discovers that he has an illegitimate child, which disqualifies him. Sheikh Beblawi is elected Grand Imam. Ibrahim's superior, Sobhi, orders him to kill Adam, revealing that NSA murdered Zizu too. Ibrahim is shocked and tries to help Adam to escape, but he is captured. Sobhi attempts to pressure Adam into confessing that he murdered Zizu. Ibrahim too gets arrested, but he manages to persuade General Sakran to arrange a meeting between Adam and Negm: Negm knows about NSA's role in Zizu's murder and plans to reveal it to the media during the trial; Ibrahim thinks that Adam can persuade Negm to reconsider. Adam succeeds and is let go. Adam returns to his home village wearing al-Azhar's signature turban. He thanks his village imam, but is unable to say what he has learnt at the university. In the final scene of the film he joins his father in the fishing boat.",

    "Synopsis": "Ha Sang-hyeon volunteers at a church with his friend Dong-soo, and together they run an illegal operation where they secretly remove babies left in the church's baby box and sell them through the adoption black market. One night, So-young leaves her newborn son, Woo-sung, at the church. When So-young returns to the church, Dong-soo explains the brokers' plan, and she decides to accompany him and Sang-hyeon to meet potential adoptive parents for Woo-sung. After visiting the orphanage where Dong-soo grew up, Hae-jin, a child from the orphanage, secretly climbs into the group's van and joins them. The police are investigating So-young for having murdered Woo-sung's biological father, while detectives Soo-jin and Lee are pursuing the brokers. After an unsuccessful sting operation, Soo-jin uses the case against So-young to secure her cooperation in arresting the brokers. The widow of Woo-sung’s father employs Tae-ho, a gangster that Sang-hyeon owes money to, to get Woo-sung back. The brokers eventually find a couple willing to adopt Woo-sung on the condition that So-young will never meet him. So-young later reveals to Sang-hyeon and Dong-soo that she murdered Woo-sung's father. At an amusement park, Dong-soo discusses the idea of the three of them raising Woo-sung together as a family. However, So-young says that she will be arrested for murder and will not be able to raise Woo-sung. Sang-hyeon meets with his estranged daughter, who says her mother does not want further contact and is expecting another child, while Soo-jin listens nearby. Soo-jin instructs So-young to turn herself in for accidental manslaughter in exchange for a three-year sentence and the ability to see Woo-sung afterward. Sang-hyeon and Dong-soo deduce that So-young has made a deal with the police but accept that she is acting for Woo-sung's sake and proceed with the plan. On the way to the meeting, Tae-ho confronts them, leading Dong-soo to continue alone while Sang-hyeon stays behind to negotiate with him. At the meeting, Dong-soo is arrested by the police and learns So-young has turned herself in. At a transit center, Sang-hyeon sees a news report stating that a body has been found in the same Seoul underground shopping center where he last met Tae-ho, and that the victim is a gangster from Busan. Three years later, Soo-jin has adopted Woo-sung. Although the couple who tried to adopt him were barred for their illegal involvement, she still lets them visit Woo-sung. After So-young is released from prison, Soo-jin writes to her and arranges a meeting with Woo-sung in a park, noting that Sang-hyeon cannot be found. Hae-jin tries to hitchhike to the park, but the orphanage bus picks him up instead. Now working at a gas station, So-young looks at a photo of the group. At the park, a hand-laundry van arrives. As So-young runs to meet Woo-sung, the van, displaying the same photo she keeps, drives off.",

    "Synopsis": "==Plot==<!--per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words--> A memorial service is being held for a kid named Jacob. There, Louis, Jacob's father, sees André Borkman, his brother-in-law. They have been estranged for over ten years, and this new encounter escalates into a physical confrontation. After being kicked out, André finds his wife Alice crying. Louis demands them to leave, threatening to call the police. Five years later, while driving to their daughter Alice's opening night of a play, Abel and his wife Marie-Louise stumble upon an ice road. There, a driver loses control of her car and hits a tree. While they try to help her, a truck nearby also loses control. In the ensuing accident, the girl dies while Alice's parents get severely injured. Before the play starts, Alice reads Louis' latest novel, in which he portrays her in a humiliating way. It is the second time this happened; on the first, she tried to stop the novel's publication, which aggravated her delicate relationship with Louis and led them to become estranged. Alice then performs the play. She later learns of the accident, goes to the hospital and meets her kid brother Fidèle. At countryside France, Louis is living with his wife Faunia. After learning that his parents will die soon, Louis decides to come back to Lille — despite not seeing any of his relatives for the past five years. After visiting the hospital, he decides to stay at his parents' apartment. He writes Alice a letter and asks Fidèle to deliver it. On a rainy day, Alice encounters a fan, Lucia. Lucia is a Romanian immigrant, who lives on a shelter and has no job. Alice invites her for a drink and reveals why she hates Louis: years before, she was an established actress, and he was a struggling writer who often asked her for money. A novel he wrote eventually gained mainstream recognition. When the novel received an important prize, Alice started to realize that she hated her now financially independent and famous brother. Her husband, André, was a long-time friend of Louis. Louis takes care of his dad at the hospital. There, he eventually sees Alice, who faints. In a flashback, Alice and André get married, despite Louis' objections. He says that he finds André not right for her. Alice informs Louis that she is pregnant. At the hospital, Marie-Louise dies. A distraught Fidèle cannot make it to the morgue where he is expected to bring her burial clothes, so Louis goes in his place. There, he overhears André and Alice discuss the funeral, which she does not want Louis to attend. Alice meets Lucia again, she plans to bury Marie-Louise and stop acting in the play. Lucia, who has not eaten anything for two days, nearly faints. Looking for food, Alice heads to the market and bumps into Louis. At the hospital, Abel removes his oxygen mask and vitals monitors. He then walks into the corridor and dies. Faunia travels to Lille for the funerals. Days after the funerals, Alice and Louis meet again. Louis and Fidèle begin emptying their childhood apartment. Distraught, Louis climbs up to the rooftop and stands at the edge of the building. Everyone begs him to walk back. Alice then joins them. Louis asks for Fidèle and his boyfriend Simon to leave and reveals to Alice that he regrets all the years he loved her, not knowing that she had always hated him. Alice leaves him alone. Louis eventually comes down and gets a fever. Alice helps him change, covers him with a blanket, and they lie in bed together. Some time later, Louis is teaching again. Alice has relocated to Abomey, in Benin and sends him a letter. In it, She says that she has left everything behind: The theater, André, her son; and she feels alive.",

Plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words, per WP:FILMPLOT, --> In rural Belgium, two 13-year-old boys, Léo and Rémi, are best friends who exhibit a deeply intimate affection for one another. They have a habit of sleeping in the same bed in Rémi's bedroom. Rémi's parents, Sophie and Peter, accept this without judgment and love Léo like a second child. Léo's family helps run agricultural work at a flower farm, where he and Rémi like to play together. At school, a trio of female classmates openly ask if the two are a couple. Léo vehemently denies it, while Rémi does not comment. Léo becomes uneasy with this external perception, exacerbated by homophobic slurs directed towards him by other boys. Fearing being ostracized, he begins new friendships and takes up ice hockey, from which he deliberately excludes Rémi. One night, while sleeping over at Rémi's, Léo decides to sleep on a separate mattress. Upon waking up, he finds Rémi sleeping on the same mattress as him. Léo turns aggressive, leaving Rémi hurt and confused. Léo becomes progressively distant from Rémi, despite Rémi's attempts at interaction. He stops sleeping over, starts riding his bicycle with students other than Rémi, continues participating in ice hockey, and spends more time working with his family at the farm. Rémi finally confronts him, to which he acts defensively. Distraught and angry, Rémi attacks Léo and the two fight. One day, after a school trip from which Rémi is absent, the class is informed that Rémi has killed himself, which Léo believes his withdrawal caused. However, he closes off his emotions from everyone else, unable to talk to anyone about it during the class therapy sessions offered by the school. The fact that his classmates describe Rémi in obituaries as a happy and friendly boy triggers a defiant opposition in Léo. Léo unsuccessfully tries to suppress his inner pain and cover it up by resuming ice hockey and gardening work with his family. Although none of his new friendships comes close to the deep connection he had with Rémi, Léo is able to confide in his older brother Charlie for comfort. Following Rémi's funeral, Léo knows he has to talk to Sophie, wanting to maintain his connection with her, but is anxious to confess. When Sophie and Peter have dinner with Léo's family, Peter breaks down when Charlie describes his future plans, as Sophie and Peter mourn the loss of Rémi's future. When summer vacation begins, Léo visits Sophie at her workplace without warning. As she drives him home, he finally confesses to her that he believes Rémi's suicide is his fault for pushing him away. After an initial moment of tension, she tenderly hugs and comforts him as they cry together. Sometime later, she and Peter have moved away, leaving the house empty. Léo walks across the field which he and Rémi used to run through, remembering their connection and allowing himself to finally grieve for Rémi.",

    "Synopsis": "In an unspecified future, significant advances in biotechnology have led to the widespread adoption of machines and analogue computers that can directly interface with and control bodily functions. Humankind itself has experienced several biological changes of indeterminate origin. Most significant among these changes is the disappearance of physical pain and infectious disease for an overwhelming majority, allowing surgeries to be performed on conscious people in ordinary settings. Other humans experience even more radical alterations to their physiology. An eight-year-old boy named Brecken can consume and digest plastics as food. Convinced he is inhuman, Brecken's mother smothers him with a pillow, leaving his corpse to be found by her ex-husband Lang. Saul Tenser and Caprice are a world-renowned performance artist couple. Taking advantage of Tenser's \"accelerated evolution syndrome,\" a disorder that causes his body to spontaneously grow new organs, they surgically remove the organs before a live audience. The syndrome leaves Tenser in constant pain and with severe respiratory and digestive discomfort. He is dependent on several specialized biomechanical devices: a bed, a machine through which Caprice performs surgery on him, and a chair that twitches and rotates as it assists him with eating. The couple meet with bureaucrats from the National Organ Registry, a governmental office upholding the state's restrictions on human evolution by cataloging and storing newly evolved organs. One of the bureaucrats, the nervy Timlin, becomes captivated by Tenser's artistic goals. At a successful show of Tenser's, she tells him that \"surgery is the new sex,\" a sentiment that Tenser and many other characters appear to embrace as repetitive cutting seems to be the preferred means of sexual gratification. A governmental police unit seeks to use Tenser to infiltrate a group of radical evolutionists. Without telling Caprice, he follows a series of contacts through other biological performance art shows that lead him to the evolutionist cell. One of them, former cosmetic surgeon Nasatir, creates a zippered cavern in Tenser's stomach, which Caprice uses to access Tenser's organs in an oral sex act where she fellates his zipper wound and presumably his internal organs while he moans in erotic pleasure. Caprice continues to network with other performance artists, eventually choosing to receive decorative cosmetic surgery on her forehead. Tenser meets with Lang, who reveals to him the agenda of the evolutionists: they have chosen to modify their digestive system to make them able to eat plastics and other synthetic chemicals. Their principal food is a bar of toxic waste, fatally poisonous to others. Lang is the cell's leader; his son Brecken had been born with the ability to eat plastic, proving the inaccuracy of the government's critical stance on human evolution. Timlin tries to initiate sex with Tenser, but he declines, saying \"I'm not very good at the old sex.\" Lang eventually approaches Tenser, wanting the couple to reveal the cell's anti-government agenda through a public autopsy of Brecken that will highlight his evolved digestive system. After some deliberation, Tenser agrees. With Timlin, Lang and many others watching, Tenser performs the autopsy, but it is revealed that Brecken's natural organ system has been surgically replaced. Lang flees the show in tears. Outside, he is approached by two agents who supposedly work for the corporation that manufactures Tenser's biomedical machines. Mimicking their earlier killing of Nasatir, they assassinate Lang by driving power drills into his head. Tenser's connection within the police unit admits that Timlin replaced Brecken's organs to keep the deviation in human evolution secret from the public. Saddened by Brecken and Lang's deaths, Tenser informs the police that he will no longer serve them, approvingly mentioning the cell's beliefs on evolution. Tenser struggles to eat in his chair.

    "Synopsis": "Insomniac detective Jang Hae-jun works in Busan and only sees his wife, Jung-an, a nuclear power plant manager residing in Ipo, once a week. Hae-jun and his partner, Soo-wan, investigate a case involving a retired immigration officer, Ki Do-soo, found dead at the foot of a mountain he often climbed. They interview his much younger wife Song Seo-rae, an emigrant from China who works as a caretaker for seniors. They suspect her because of her lack of displays of grief, a scratch on her hand, bruises on her legs and torso, broken ribs, and a tattoo of Ki's initials resembling the monogram he used to mark his belongings. Hae-jun conducts further interviews with Seo-rae and conducts nightly stakeouts outside of her apartment building, becoming infatuated with her in the process. Seo-rae observes him outside her building, and witnesses him on one of his other investigations. Seo-rae's Monday client says Seo-rae was with her on the day Ki died, and camera footage shows Seo-rae outside her Monday client's home shortly before Ki's time of death. Questioned about her background, Seo-rae admits that in China she killed her terminally ill mother with fentanyl pills at her request. Before dying, she told Seo-rae to go to Korea to climb the mountain her Korean grandfather, an independence fighter in Manchuria, had left her. Seo-rae gives Hae-jun letters written by Ki admitting to corrupt business dealings, including a letter sent to a subordinate that Hae-jun interprets as a suicide note. Hae-jun rules the death a suicide, despite Soo-wan's doubts, and informs Seo-rae that she is no longer a suspect. Seo-rae and Hae-jun go on a date at a Buddhist temple, visit each other's homes, and become close. At his apartment, Seo-rae burns Hae-jun's evidence photos from her husband's case, reasoning that Hae-jun's insomnia is caused by his disturbing cases haunting him. When Hae-jun fills in for a visit to Seo-rae's Monday client, Hae-jun learns that Seo-rae and the client have the same model of cell phone, and that the client has dementia and does not know what day of the week it is. On the client's phone, he sees that the housebound woman apparently walked the distance equivalent to 138 flights of stairs on the day of Ki's death. Hae-jun realizes Seo-rae switched her phone for her client's and then climbed the mountain to push Ki off. Confronting Seo-rae in her apartment, he concludes that she also forged the suicide note and, to her consternation, accuses her of getting close to him to destroy his evidence. Hae-jun says Seo-rae has destroyed his pride in his job and that, since meeting her, he has become \"shattered\"; nevertheless, he has covered up the evidence and instructs her to throw the incriminating phone into the sea before leaving. Thirteen months later, Hae-jun has moved to Ipo to live with Jung-an after developing depression and more severe insomnia. At a fish market with Jung-an, he encounters Seo-rae with her new husband Im Ho-Shin, a business investor. The next day, Ho-Shin is found dead in his mansion's swimming pool. Hae-jun takes on the case and is convinced Seo-rae is the culprit. She admits only to draining the pool so that Hae-jun would not be disturbed by the blood. Sa Cheol-seong, a Chinese immigrant, soon confesses to killing Ho-Shin for defrauding his late mother of millions of dollars. Sa denies that Seo-rae played any role and reveals he had installed a tracker on Seo-rae's phone so he could find where Ho-Shin lived. Hae-jun confronts Seo-rae at the mountain her grandfather left her. She rushes at Hae-jun after he scatters her grandfather and mother's ashes at the edge of the mountain, only to hug him as she did at her apartment. She reveals that she kept the phone with the incriminating evidence from Ki's case, and proposes that he use it to \"reinvestigate\" her. They kiss passionately. Hae-jun returns home to find that Jung-an, who suspects him of having worked with Seo-rae to murder Ho-shin, is leaving him. The next day, Hae-jun learns from Sa that Seo-rae visited Sa's mother in the hospital on the day that she died. He concludes that Seo-rae slipped Sa's mother the remaining fentanyl pills she had in her possession, knowing Sa would kill Ho-Shin as soon as his mother died. Hae-jun tracks Seo-rae's phone via the tracker Sa installed and chases her to a beach. Over the phone, she tells him that Ho-Shin discovered a phone recording of Hae-jun telling Seo-rae that he loved her, and that Ho-Shin had planned to expose their illicit relationship. Hae-jun does not recall telling Seo-rae that he loved her, though she says she began loving him the moment he stopped loving her. At the beach, he finds her empty car and the cell phone, which contains the recording of his instructions to Seo-rae to destroy the phone with evidence from Ki's case. Further out on the shore, Seo-rae digs a pit in the sand and climbs into it as the tide rises, letting it drown and bury her. Hae-jun arrives at the beach and is unable to find Seo-rae, unaware that she is buried in the sand beneath him. He searches desperately for her and cries in anguish.",

When Animal Rights activists help get the circus shut down, EO is taken away and brought to a horse stable to work. In the truck being transported, and at the stables, EO sees horses running free and being pampered. After knocking over a shelf of trophies, EO is sent to a farm, where he seems depressed and won't eat. He gives rides to children through woods, where trees are being cut down. One night Kasandra visits him, bringing him a carrot muffin for his birthday, and telling him, \"may all your dreams come true.\" When she leaves, EO gets through the fence and tries to follow her, getting lost. EO walks through the dark forest among various non-human life. Hunters with laser scopes begin shooting. EO observes a mortally wounded wolf. Sometime later, EO walks through an empty town, and in a store window sees tropical fish in an aquarium. He ends up at a soccer game, and his braying distracts a penalty shot, angering the losing team. The winning team takes EO with them to a local bar. That night, members of the losing team ransack the bar, and upon seeing EO, beat him nearly to death. A four-legged robot is seen struggling to successfully stand and right itself. EO is at an animal hospital, where a janitor questions why the vet is trying to save him. Later, EO is working at a fur factory where a man shocks and kills terrified foxes.

EO notices the gate into The Countess' estate has opened, and he leaves. EO walks over a stone bridge in front of a large dam, watching the water flow. Sometime later, EO is with cows being led into a slaughterhouse. The screen goes to black, followed by the sound of a captive bolt pistol being fired, indicating EO has been slaughtered.",

    "film_title": "Holy Spider",
    "Synopsis": "Tehran-based journalist Arezoo Rahimi arrives in the Iranian holy city of Mashhad to investigate a serial killer targeting local street prostitutes addicted to drugs, dubbed the \"Spider Killer\" by the media. The killer follows a pattern of picking up women on his motorcycle, taking them to an apartment and strangling them with their headscarves, before ultimately disposing of their corpses in desolate areas on the city's outskirts. Rahimi teams up with Sharifi, the editor of a local newspaper, to discover the killer's identity. Sharifi has been in contact with the killer, Saeed Azimi, having been chosen by Saeed as a publicist of sorts. Saeed claims to be cleansing the city in the name of Imam Reza, the eighth Shia Imam; he is shown in tears at the Imam's shrine. A veteran of the Iran–Iraq War, Saeed is married with three children and works as a construction worker. In her efforts to investigate the murders, Rahimi encounters resistance, both from relatives and associates of the victims who fear being ostracized further for their connections to prostitutes, and from policemen who express indifference due to the social stigma of prostitution. One officer tries to intimidate Rahimi with her past history; her whistleblowing of a previous boss's inappropriate behavior resulted in her firing. Eventually, Rahimi and Sharifi are confident enough in the schedule, location, and patterns of the killer to lure him into a trap. Rahimi, posing as a sex worker, boards Saeed's motorcycle. Sharifi follows by car but loses them in the city's backstreets. Rahimi, armed with a pocket knife and a tape recorder, plans to elicit a confession from the murderer and flee but is soon overpowered. After loudly calling for help, she manages to escape and make her way to the police with evidence. In the following days, Saeed is arrested by the police. As the case goes to trial, Saeed gains strong public support. When offered the opportunity to plead insanity, he reinforces his religious motivations, insisting he is only \"crazy\" about the eighth Imam and God. When Rahimi interviews Saeed in prison, he confesses to killing 16 women and ominously declares that Rahimi would have been his 17th victim. The following day, Saeed is found guilty and is sentenced to 100 lashes and death. Saeed is visited in his cell by his father-in-law Haji and his lawyer, who assure him that he will be spared the death sentence and that on the day of his execution, he will be secretly whisked away in a car. When the day arrives, Saeed is spared the 100 lashes, but when taken into the execution room, he panics when no one comes to his rescue, instead being executed by hanging. After saying goodbye to Sharifi, Rahimi boards a bus back to Tehran. While traveling, she reviews video evidence gathered during the case, pausing over an interview with Saeed's teenage son, Ali, in which he proudly describes how his father overpowered and choked his victims, before re-enacting his father's killings with his younger sister playing the role of the victim.",

The family argues constantly and is seemingly crushed by debts, caught in a country with a huge economic crisis and unbelievable inflations as a result of the US economic sanctions on the country. As her brothers are trying to make ends meet, Leila formulates a plan: to start a family business that would save them from poverty. Looking for capital to fund the costs of a storefront in a soon-to-be converted mall bathroom, they are surprised by their father, Esmail, who in his ambition to become family patriarch wants to gift 40 gold coins at a wedding, while he, cares nothing about the ambitions of his well-grown children. However, Leila in cahoots with her three other brothers tricks Alireza who is supposed to present the coins on behalf of his father by giving him an empty box. The father is crowned patriarch just to be demoted and replaced by a rival, shortly after it turns out that Alireza does not have coins to give. The father claims he took out a mortgage to buy the coins and the family will be homeless if he doesn't get back the money. Alireza feeling used and fearing for the roof over their head incites his brothers against Leila's plans, they decide to give back their father the money to pay the mortgage. Inflation and rising prices however crush their plans making it near impossible to get enough money for the coins or to be able to buy them back leaving them ever closer to financial ruin. In a final reveal, however, it turns out that the father did not mortgage the house at all but had a secret bank account, living in filth and letting his children suffer while hoarding cash, from which he funded the coins. Soon after this revelation the father dies during a young girl's birthday party, which only Alireza notices leaving him in shock surrounded by joyous celebrations.",

She is also working on a showing of her work, clay sculptures of women in joyful or anguished movement. Lizzy's landlord and neighbor Jo, a rival artist, frequently spars with her. For days, Lizzy is continuously reminding Jo to fix Lizzy's water heater, but Jo prioritizes everything else, like hanging a tire swing in the backyard and her two upcoming shows. To have enough time to finish her sculptures, Lizzy takes Tuesday off from work. In the middle of the night, Lizzy's cat maims a pigeon that flew into the house. Lizzy throws the pigeon outside, but Jo discovers and rescues it the next morning, before dumping the work of taking care of it on Lizzy.

When Jo finally comes for the bird, Lizzy lets her know it distracted her and kept her from her glazing. Lizzy visits her father at home. She does not trust the hippies who have invited themselves to stay with him, who are more grifters than friends. Lizzy discovers that he has not had contact with her brother Sean for six months. Concerned, Lizzy goes to see Sean. He has become reclusive, and is delusional, convinced that his neighbors are behind his TV antenna not working. Contacting their mother about it, Lizzy believes her brother needs more than just emotional help, but is told he is simply a misunderstood genius. The weekend right before her show, Lizzy's final piece burns on one side in the kiln. Visiting Sean, he is digging a massive pit in his backyard and insists he is hearing voices, which Lizzy and others choose not to hear. She convinces her mother to come watch him.

    "Synopsis": "Trish is a young American journalist stranded in Nicaragua during the COVID-19 pandemic and amid a period of severe governmental instability. She is a travel writer whose coverage of brutal extrajudicial killings has alienated both her superiors and the ruling party; her passport has been confiscated and she is living in a flophouse paid for by a sympathetic cabinet minister. Trish assumes that she will be executed for her anti-government activities when the minister can no longer protect her. She has sex with government officials for money and basic necessities (largely unavailable due to the political crisis) while searching desperately for a way out of the country. One day, Trish solicits a British man named Daniel for sex in a hotel reserved for wealthy foreigners. Daniel introduces himself as a petrochemicals consultant, but Trish assumes that he is really an intelligence agent. They have passionate, tender sex, and Trish follows him the day after. She observes him meeting with a man she identifies as a Costa Rican police officer. When questioned about the meeting, Daniel is surprised to hear of the man's true identity, eventually realizing his hostile intentions after the officer chases the two through a market. Trish lets Daniel hide out in the flophouse. The Costa Rican officer quickly finds them, but he is unwilling to attack Daniel in a building protected by a governmental official. Trish and Daniel fall in love. The climax of their emotional bond occurs in a deserted nightclub, where they dance romantically as he speaks about his wife. Eventually, Trish is informed that the government can no longer protect her; she runs out of money and Daniel is cut off by his employer. Realizing that they will be killed by the Costa Rican once they leave the hotel, the two steal a car and drive towards a border. Along the way, they meet a man who Trish quickly realizes is a CIA agent. The man offers Trish safe passage to the U.S. in exchange for Daniel, but Trish refuses. At the border, the agent offers her the same deal, and questions how they will cross the border without Trish's passport. It becomes clear that the agent and the Costa Rican are colluding with the authoritarian government, while Daniel is in some way trying to destabilize it. Trish and Daniel trade the car to smugglers in exchange for a boat ride across the border. At the end of the journey, the smugglers are shot dead by unseen soldiers and Daniel is wounded. They make their way to an abandoned church and fall asleep. When they wake up, the agent and the Costa Rican, along with armed troops, have surrounded them. Daniel convinces Trish to abandon him, and the soldiers take him away. A Nicaraguan police officer and former client of Trish's returns her passport, allowing her to legally fly home. The agent pays her and leaves.",

Five years later the 16-year-old Pietro and Bruno coincidentally meet at a bar, neither speaking to the other. Pietro's family returns to Grana but it's not the same without Bruno. Soon, Pietro stops visiting the mountains and clashes between him and his father lead them to grow apart. 15 years later, 31-year-old Pietro has found a job at a restaurant in Turin. One winter night, he receives a call from his mother that his father has died. He also learns that in his absence his father has continued to see Bruno. He returns to Grana. Eventually he finds Bruno in the mountains where his father has left a pile of rocks and wood on a slope intending to build a house. It becomes clear that while Pietro was alienated from his father, his father had become closer to Bruno. Bruno confronts Pietro with the aimlessness of his life and pushes him to help him build the house his father had wanted. They begin work, lasting months. Bruno plans to restore his uncle's pasture and continue living the life of a mountaineer, and encourages Pietro to follow his dream and write a book. The following summer, Pietro returns to Grana with new friends including Lara, with whom he is briefly involved. Months later, Bruno calls Pietro to tell him that Lara is interested in working with him; Bruno and Lara soon become a couple and a daughter is born. Feeling dissatisfied with his aimless life, Pietro decides to reinvent himself by visiting Nepal. After having published his book, Pietro visits Bruno. One night, Pietro tells him about a Nepalese he met who described how the world consists of eight circular mountain ranges divided by eight seas, and at the center of it all is Mount Meru, the tallest mountain. Pietro asks Bruno whether the person who has visited the eight mountains and eight seas is more learned than the person who has scaled Mount Meru. Bruno identifies himself as being on Mount Meru and Pietro claims to be visiting the eight mountains and that he is more knowledgeable. Back in Nepal, Pietro begins dating schoolteacher Asmi. Returning to Grana, he informs Bruno of his plans to settle down in Nepal and probably will not be returning to Grana yearly; Bruno invites him to dinner. Pietro hikes to a peak he and his father Giovanni reached decades ago and finds the summit book in which Giovanni had written on that occasion. In this and similar summit books on other mountain peaks he finds his father's experiences and feelings during hikes there with Pietro and Bruno and later with just Bruno. Later at dinner, Bruno and Lara argue over financial issues with her accusing him of having his head in the clouds. Pietro offers to help but Bruno refuses. One day back in Nepal, Pietro receives a call from Bruno who tells him that his pasture has been taken away and that Lara and their daughter are living with her family. He wants to spend some alone time at the house they built and would appreciate Pietro's company. Pietro obliges. One night, Bruno reminisces about the former happiness of his marriage; Pietro replies that he is a good father who should take up a regular job so he will not abandon his daughter like his father did him. Angered, Bruno tells Pietro to leave. Pietro visits Lara who tells him that she now understands how little she means to Bruno in comparison to his mountain. Pietro remarks that he wandered too far away and should have stayed there. He makes up with Bruno who accepts his life living alone in the mountains. Bruno tells him to not worry about him for the mountain has never hurt him. One day, Lara calls Pietro and tells him that a snowstorm buried the house and Bruno is nowhere to be found, possibly dead. When the snow starts to thaw, birds are seen scavenging on something partially buried in the snow, presumably Bruno. (This is related to an earlier discussion of the Nepalese “sky burial” ritual, where the deceased are left on the mountains for animals to consume). As rescuers had broken into the house by making a hole in the roof, Pietro reasons that the house will therefore not last either because in some lives, there are mountains to which one cannot return, including the one at the center of it all. As he plays soccer with children at Asmi's school, he realizes that all that remains is to wander the eight mountains because on the highest mountain, he lost a friend.",

The two serve as musical performers at the restaurant of Betim, a man who uses his business to cover up a drug ring the two courier for, and sometimes pays Lokita for sexual favors. Lokita is trying to obtain a work visa with which she can support both herself and Tori, but she also has to deal with the debt contracted with the people who brought her to Belgium and think about the mother and five brothers she left behind in Cameroon. When Lokita's application papers are rejected again, she accepts Betim's offer to work for him for several months, locked up in a hangar tending cannabis plantations. But this means she has to be separated from Tori, without even being able to call him, which becomes unbearable for both of them. Tori hides in Betim's car to find out where Lokita is, then manages to find a way into the hangar. But on his second visit, they are both discovered by Betim. They flee, followed by Betim and his aide Luckas, who finds and kills Lokita with two gunshots to the head. Luckas cannot find Tori, who has remained hidden in the bushes. The film ends with Lokita's funeral, where Tori performs a song that the two enjoyed.",

    "Synopsis": "Part 1: Carl & Yaya <br /> Carl, a model, attends an uncomfortable and demeaning casting call with other male models. Carl is dating Yaya, a fellow model and influencer, and resents her for expecting him to pay for meals even though she earns far more than he does. They bicker about money and gender roles. Yaya admits that she is in a relationship with Carl for the engagement it earns them on social media, and that she seeks to become a trophy wife, but Carl declares that she will come to love him. Part 2: The Yacht <br /> Carl and Yaya are invited on a luxury cruise aboard a superyacht in exchange for its social media promotion. Among the guests are the Russian oligarch Dimitry and his wife Vera; the elderly couple Clementine and Winston, who have made their fortune manufacturing grenades and other weapons; Therese, a wheelchair user only capable of speaking a single phrase in German (in den Wolken, i.e. \"in the clouds\") following a stroke; and Jarmo, a lonely tech millionaire who flirts with Yaya, who uses her sexual appeal to influence him despite this making Carl upset. The guests luxuriate on the yacht, oblivious to the crew working to meet their every need and ridiculous whim. The head of staff, Paula, demands they obey the guests' absurd requests, including having every crew member swim in the sea. The kitchen crew is ordered to swim as well, despite the chef warning that the food will go bad. Carl complains to Paula about a crew member whom Yaya finds attractive, inadvertently getting the man fired. Meanwhile, the yacht's captain, Thomas Smith, spends his time drunk in his cabin. Despite a raging storm, the staff carries on with holding a fine dining dinner the guests expect. The guests become violently ill with a combination of food poisoning and seasickness due to the food being left out earlier in the day and the tumultuous storm. The drunken Thomas and Dimitry debate in favor of communism and capitalism, respectively, which is broadcast over the intercom. The guests spend the evening puking while wearing their life jackets, creating mess and flooding the sewage system. While the menial staff get to work cleaning things up, the guest staff sabotage the entire ship's power in an attempt to cut the captain's intercom to put on a cheerful face and stop him from upsetting the guests. When morning arrives, pirates attack, killing Clementine and Winston with one of their own grenades and sinking the yacht. Part 3: The Island <br /> A small group of survivors consisting of guests Carl, Yaya, Dimitry, Therese, and Jarmo, ship's head of guest staff Paula, ship's mechanic Nelson (whom Dimitry accuses of being a pirate), and Toilet Manager Abigail manage to escape to an island. At first, Paula continues to order Abigail to serve the useless cruise guests. When it becomes clear that Abigail is the only one with survival skills, such as catching fish and starting a fire, the traditional class system is upended. Abigail rises in power and the others must curry her favor with gifts and labor. Paula quickly shifts allegiance to Abigail. Abigail gains her own private shelter inside a lifeboat and lures Carl into a sexual relationship by giving him food in exchange for sexual favors. Yaya grows resentful at the role reversal and is disoriented that her own lack of sexual power in the situation on the island means she has zero means of influence. The wealthy guests remain fairly nonchalant and carry on like normal, creating games and making art. Jarmo kills a wild donkey for food by smashing it with a rock, which Dimitry, Nelson and the others celebrate with a primitive dinner party. When Yaya decides to hike to the other side of the island, Abigail volunteers to go with her. Back at the camp, Therese encounters a beach vendor hawking fake luxury goods, but is unable to communicate her situation to the man as he is only interested in selling to her. Yaya and Abigail discover a lift built into the rocks and realize they have been stranded near a luxury resort. Yaya celebrates finding the lift, but Abigail prepares to attack Yaya with a rock to prevent her from telling the others and forcing Abigail to return to a menial, powerless role back in society. The camera cuts away to an injured Carl frantically running through the jungle.",

    "film_title": "Anatomy of a Fall",
    "Synopsis": "In an isolated mountain chalet near Grenoble, novelist Sandra Voyter decides to reschedule her interview with a female student because her husband, university lecturer Samuel Maleski, plays music loudly in their attic, disrupting the interview. After the student drives away from the chalet, Sandra's eleven-year-old son Daniel, who is visually impaired, takes a walk outside with his guide dog Snoop. When they return home, Daniel finds Samuel dead from an apparent fall. Sandra insists that the fall must have been accidental. Her old friend and lawyer, Vincent, suggests the possibility of suicide, while Sandra recalls her husband's attempt to overdose on aspirin six months earlier, after going off antidepressants. After an investigation, Daniel's conflicting accounts of what happened shortly before his father's death, combined with the revelation that Samuel sustained a head wound before his body hit the ground and an audio recording of a fight between Samuel and Sandra the previous day, Sandra is indicted on charges of homicide. She is released on bail soon after. One year later, Sandra's trial begins. Her defense team claims Samuel fell from the attic window and hit his head on a shed below, while the prosecution posits that Sandra hit him with a blunt object and pushed him from the second-floor balcony. During a courtroom argument with Samuel's psychiatrist, Sandra admits her resentment toward her husband due to his partial responsibility for the accident that led to Daniel's impaired vision. In the recorded fight, Samuel accuses Sandra of plagiarism, infidelity, and exerting control over his life, before their protracted argument turns physically violent. The prosecution claims that all the violence came from Sandra. She counters that while she had slapped Samuel, the rest of the violence heard was her husband self-harming. After Sandra admits to an affair with a woman the year before Samuel's death, the prosecution argues that Samuel's loud music indicated jealousy over Sandra's flirting with the interviewer, leading to the physical confrontation later. The prosecutor also notes Sandra's pattern of writing personal conflicts into her stories, and how murdering her husband mirrors a minor character's thoughts from her most recent novel. In turn, Sandra protests that one recording does not represent the nature of their relationship, nor do the words of a character in a novel reflect her own inclinations. A distraught Daniel insists on testifying before closing arguments the following Monday. The judge lays strict ground rules to prevent anyone from influencing his testimony and brings in a court monitor, Marge. Daniel then asks that Sandra leave their house for the weekend so he can be alone with Marge and Snoop. He recalls that when Samuel overdosed, Snoop also fell sick, possibly due to having eaten Samuel's vomit. He then deliberately feeds Snoop aspirin and finds it has the same effect, which aligns with Sandra's testimony. Daniel confides to Marge his anguish, and she advises him that if he doesn't know what is really true, he can instead decide what's true for him. On the witness stand, Daniel says he can comprehend his father taking his own life but not the murder scenario. He says that when he and Samuel were driving Snoop to the veterinarian, Samuel spoke about the need to be prepared that those he loves will die and to know that his life will go on, which Daniel now interprets as his father's own suicidal thoughts. Sandra is acquitted following Daniel's testimony. When she returns home, Daniel tells her he was afraid of her homecoming and she says that she was too; the two embrace. As Sandra heads to bed, she lingers at a photo of her and Samuel before falling asleep with Snoop.",

    "Synopsis": "Rookie New York City Fire Department (FDNY) paramedic Ollie Cross arrives in the chaotic aftermath of a gang shooting. He triages a foot wound, then is directed to a critically injured victim. Veteran paramedic Gene Rutkovsky leads Cross through the man's treatment but the patient dies during transport. The following day, Cross and Rutkovsky are called to a dog bite injury of a child, which has inflamed tempers at a community gym. Cross tries to defuse the situation by taking the dog away, but a man threatens him at gunpoint and kills the dog. Later, Cross suffers incessant verbal abuse from a junkie being transported to hospital, and helps to perform a difficult tracheal intubation in a butchers. Cross explains to Rutkovsky that he's living in a tiny apartment with two roommates to save money while studying to retake the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). Cross becomes irate when he finds Lafontaine has put the dead dog in his locker. He goes out to a club and begins a sexual relationship with Clara. Rutkovsky successfully defibrillates a patient, and they good-naturedly take verbal abuse from an older drunk woman. Cross reveals that as a child he watched his mother die in the bath with self-inflicted deep wrist injuries. Rutkovsky talks about overworking, which ruined several of his marriages, and that he was a September&nbsp;11 responder. Called to a woman injured in a fall, Cross and Rutkovsky discover an obvious domestic assault. They almost come to blows with the victim's overbearing husband when police arrive and intercede. Rutkovsky is reported for accidentally hitting a police officer. He takes leave to be with his young daughter Sylvie before his ex-wife Nancy moves them upstate to live with her new boyfriend. Partnered with Lafontaine, Cross is sent alone to discover a rotting corpse in the bathtub of a decrepit apartment, swarming with flies; the experience affects Cross's relationship with Clara. When Rutkovsky returns, they are called to a shelter for a woman in labor, hoping they might deliver a baby. Instead, they arrive to Nia passed-out after prematurely delivering the baby during a heroin overdose. Rutkovsky says the baby is stillborn and takes it to another room while Cross treats Nia. When she regains consciousness, Nia says that she had been sober during the pregnancy but took heroin due to childbirth pain. Rutkovsky returns without the baby and they prepare to take Nia to the hospital when another paramedic team arrive, find the baby, and resuscitate it. Cross covers for Rutkovsky at a department debriefing and receives a reprimand while Rutkovsky is suspended. The next day, gang members persistently crowd Lafontaine and Cross, interfering with their ability to treat and move a patient. In the ambulance, Lafontaine searches the man and finds illegal drugs, then turns off the man's oxygen. Cross turns it back on, and Lafontaine protests that the drug dealer deserves to die and they can decide who survives transport, implying that Rutkovsky feels the same way. Later, Cross chokes Clara during sex and she severs their relationship. Lafontaine solicits Cross's help in beating a young drug dealer but instead Cross hits Lafontaine, to the latter's encouragement. Cross retakes the MCAT but is distracted by his experiences. He meets with Rutkovsky and they fight over the practice of withholding treatment. Rutkovsky calls Cross a coward for not doing what he knows is right, while Cross counters that denying treatment is tantamount to murder. Cross is partnered with Verdis and they are called to a boy having a painful seizure but his religious father denies treatment. Verdis advises Cross that with the pressures of the job, they have to look out for each other. They are called for a jumper at Rutkovsky's address and they find him dead. Cross has to be restrained by other paramedics, breaks down, and contemplates suicide. A year later, Cross visits Nia at a drug rehabilitation center and apologizes, saying that he became a paramedic for the best reasons but on that day he did the exact opposite. Still working as a paramedic, he breaks protocol to go into a burning building and intubates a girl who he is able to rescue.",

    "film_title": "Asteroid City",
    "Synopsis": "In a retro-futuristic version of the 1950s, a television host introduces<!-- a live production [citation needed] of --> a documentary about the creation and production of Asteroid City, a play by the famed playwright Conrad Earp. The play's events are depicted in widescreen and stylized color, while the television special is seen in black-and-white Academy ratio. In the play, a youth astronomy convention is held in the fictional desert town of Asteroid City. War photojournalist Augie Steenbeck arrives early to the Junior Stargazer convention with Woodrow, his intellectual teenage son, and his three younger daughters. When their car breaks down, Augie phones his father-in-law, Stanley, asking for his help. Stanley, who dislikes his son-in-law, persuades him to tell the children about their mother's recent death, which Augie had concealed. Augie and Woodrow meet Midge Campbell, a famous but world-weary actress, and her daughter Dinah, who, like Woodrow, will be honored at the convention. Augie and Midge, and Woodrow and Dinah, gradually fall in love throughout the play. The other convention participants arrive: * Five-star General Grif Gibson * Astronomer Dr. Hickenlooper * Three additional teenaged honorees (Clifford, Shelly, and Ricky) * Their parents (J.J., Sandy, and Roger) * A busload of elementary-school children chaperoned by young teacher June Douglas * A cowboy band led by singer Montana. A local motel provides everyone's accommodations. Gibson welcomes the attendees at the Asteroid City crater where the teenagers are to receive awards for various inventions. A UFO suddenly appears above the crater; an alien emerges and steals the remnant of the meteorite that created the crater. Augie manages to photograph the creature. Gibson, with instructions from the president, places the town under military quarantine, and everyone is subjected to medical and psychiatric examinations. Meanwhile, a romance blossoms between Montana and June, who assure the students that the alien is likely peaceful. The Stargazer honorees use Dr. Hickenlooper's equipment to attempt to contact the alien. Tricking the guard watching the pay phone, Ricky calls his school newspaper to relay the quarantine details and cover-up to the outside world. The Asteroid City events become national news. A furious Gibson is about to be forced to end the quarantine when the UFO reappears, dropping the meteorite back into its former position; the General sees new markings on it and deduces that it has been \"inventoried.\" Gibson then reinstates the quarantine; the children, scientists, and parents revolt, using the honorees' inventions to overpower the military. In the play's epilogue, Augie and his family are the last to leave Asteroid City after Gibson officially lifts the quarantine. Woodrow reveals he has won the fellowship funding and intends to use the funds on Dinah, and Midge leaves Augie her mailing address. Stanley attempts to convince Augie's daughters to exhume their mother's ashes, which the girls had buried near their rental, but gives up as the family decide to make a prayer in her memory. Afterwards, Augie and his family quietly drive away. Throughout the film, the play's creation is interspersed with the play itself in the television documentary. Some time after Conrad Earp started writing, he meets with actor Jones Hall, who performs an audition in Earp's home and is immediately cast. During the same interaction, Earp and Hall kiss, establishing their relationship as lovers. Earp writes the play with help from a local acting school and recruits most cast members from it, including Mercedes Ford, a temperamental yet talented actress who plays Midge. During the recorded performance of the play, Hall, who plays Augie, confronts the play's director Schubert Green, saying he \"still doesn't understand the play\", and asks Green if he is \"doing him right\". Green tells Hall to keep playing Augie the same way despite being uncertain, and that he is doing him right. After that interaction, while taking a smoke break on a balcony, Hall runs into the actress who was cast to play Augie's wife before her only scene was cut. She recites the deleted scene's text to him, and he appears to gain new insight from it. Six months into the play's run, Conrad Earp dies in an automobile accident.",

His singing is complimented by Liisa, who is drinking with her friend and co-worker Ansa. While Huotari tries (and fails) to seduce Liisa, Holappa and Ansa notice each other, but do not talk. Another night, while returning home, Ansa sees Holappa drunk and unconscious at a bus stop. After checking that he is okay, she leaves just before he wakes up. Ansa is eventually fired for taking expired food from the supermarket. In desperate need of money, she starts working as a dishwasher at a bar for a meagre under-the-table salary. On her second day on the job, her boss is arrested for peddling drugs, and she is jobless once again, but runs into Holappa who buys her a coffee and a pastry. They later see The Dead Don't Die at the cinema and seem to hit it off. At the end of the date, she writes down her phone number for Holappa, but says she won't reveal her name until the next time they meet. While stopping to smoke a cigarette, he unknowingly drops and loses the paper from his pocket. Ansa grows disappointed waiting for a phone call while Holappa has no way of tracking her down. Remembering that Ansa told him that she lives near the cinema, he repeatedly goes there and waits at the entrance for hours. He eventually sustains an injury at work, and is fired after failing a breathalyzer test, which also gets him kicked out of the company dormitory. Ansa and Holappa eventually reunite outside the cinema one night, and Ansa invites him over for dinner. Everything seems to go well, until she catches him drinking from a hip flask in her flat. Because of the tragedies alcoholism has caused to her family, an angry Ansa confronts Holappa, who refuses to \"take orders\" and storms out. Without a home, he sleeps on benches at night and gets a job in construction, but is once again fired for drinking at work. Nonetheless, he continues to despondently drink at bars. One day, while returning from her new ironworker job, Ansa saves a homeless dog by adopting it. At home, she washes the dog and treats it with affection. Missing Ansa (who also misses him), Holappa finds housing and pours his liquor bottles down the drain. He calls Ansa (who answers with her name, while he greets her with \"it's me\") to apologise, and they agree to meet up right away. On his way to her house, however, he is struck by a train. Ansa waits for him at home, oblivious to the accident. One day while walking her dog, Ansa runs into Huotari who reveals that Holappa is in a coma. Huotari also asks for Liisa's number, despite knowing she thinks he is too old for her. Ansa gives him the number and goes to the hospital. Though she only knows Holappa's surname, Ansa cons the staff by pretending to be his \"sister in faith\" in order to see him. Each day while Holappa is in a coma, she reads and talks to him. Meanwhile, Liisa indicates that she and Huotari have begun seeing each other. One day, Holappa wakes up and leaves the hospital with Ansa and her dog. Holappa asks what the dog is called. She answers \"Chaplin\".",

    "Synopsis": "In 1851, Edgardo Mortara is the sixth child of a Jewish family from the city of Bologna, part of the Papal States. Believing him sick and dying, the Christian maid Anna Morisi administers baptism in secret, for fear that when he dies he will end up in limbo. The child survives, but seven years later Anna tells Pier Gaetano Feletti, head of the Bolognese office of the Holy Inquisition, about the baptism: the sacrament would have made the child irrevocably Catholic, and since the laws of the Papal States forbid a Christian to be raised by non-Christians, Feletti decides to remove the child from his family. On 24 June, Edgardo was forcibly taken and brought to Rome, where he would stay in the Casa dei Catecumeni, the boarding school for the children of converted Jews. Edgardo's parents, Momolo and Marianna, do everything to draw public attention to the case, arousing the indignation of European and non-European intellectuals. However, this causes Pope Pius IX to take the matter to heart: the papacy is in fact in a moment of acute political crisis, the pope having lost prestige and authority and being seen as a reactionary impediment to the Unification of Italy. Pius IX decides to stand up to all the accusations, personally taking care of Edgardo's education and having him publicly administered a second (canonically unnecessary) baptism or reception to dispel any doubts about his belonging to the Catholic Church. Edgardo is raised and educated in a completely Catholic environment. Months after Edgardo's arrival in Rome, Momolo and Marianna obtain permission to visit him. Members of the Roman Jewish community coldly welcome the two, as they are afraid of losing the privileges granted by the pope due to the media outcry aroused by the affair. Momolo, therefore, decides to treat Edgardo with detachment, telling him only that he's happy to find him in good health; in front of Marianna, however, the child bursts into tears and reveals to his mother that he still secretly recites the Shema Yisrael every night. Those in charge of Edgardo's education therefore forbid any future visits, unless the whole family converts to Catholicism. The Mortaras refuse and organize an attempted kidnapping of the child, which however fails and causes the total loss of support from the Jews of Rome. In 1859, after the Second Italian War of Independence, Bologna was taken from the pope by rioters. The judicial authorities of the Kingdom of Sardinia, which then exercised jurisdiction in the city, arrest Pier Gaetano Feletti and put him on trial in the Mortara case. During the hearings, the whole story is reconstructed and it is discovered that the baptism administered by Anna Morisi is valid to all intents and purposes. The second baptism ceremony is not relevant. Feletti is acquitted of the charges, as he acted in full compliance with the laws in force at the time of the events. Edgardo remains in Rome. The Pope is still sovereign there because of military assistance from France under Napoleon III. In 1870 with the commencement of the Franco-Prussian War, the French troops are withdrawn, the Kingdom of Italy occupies Rome and the eleven-hundred-year history of the Papal States comes to an end with Pope Pius IX losing his temporal power. Meanwhile, Edgardo grows up in the care of the Pope. He studies for the priesthood and assumes the clerical name of Pio Maria. In 1870, with the breach of Porta Pia, Rome becomes part of the Kingdom of Italy. One of Edgardo's older brothers, Riccardo, who is a soldier in the occupying army, runs to look for him and tells him that he can finally return home. However, Edgardo refuses, stating that his real family is now the Catholic church. When Pius IX dies in 1878, Edgardo, in an impulsive act, joins the rioters who wish to throw his coffin into the Tiber. He regrets his action and runs away. Years later, Marianna, Edgardo's mother, is dying and Edgardo, who years earlier had refused to go to his father's funeral, finally returns home. Taking advantage of a moment when he is alone with his mother, the young man tries to baptise her, but she refuses, declaring that she lives as a Jew and wants to die as a Jew. Edgardo is driven away by his siblings after this attempted conversion. This appears to be his family's final break with Edgardo. The film's closing credits state that Edgardo was ordained as a priest in the Canons Regular, worked throughout Europe as a missionary and preacher and that he died in a monastery in Belgium in 1940 at the age of 88.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1980, Arthur, a former British archaeologist, returns to Italy after being released from prison; he was arrested for stealing artifacts from tombs to sell to an art dealer named Spartaco. He goes to visit his ex-girlfriend Beniamina's mother, Flora, at her family home, where he also meets her live-in maid and student, Italia. Beniamina has been missing for an undisclosed amount of time, but her mother is convinced she will one day return. Beniamina's sisters are sick of Arthur seemingly freeloading off their mother and try to find him a job, which he refuses. At his hut, Arthur discovers that his collection of artifacts is missing. Arthur confronts his gang of tombaroli friends, and they return the stolen artifacts and attempt to reconcile. He rebuffs them initially, but accompanies them to the Epiphany celebrations in town. During the festival, a farmer approaches them about locating a tomb on his land. Arthur, his gang, and a young photographer named Melodie, search for the tomb, which Arthur locates using a dowsing twig and through his 'chimeras,' visions he experiences near gravesites. Arthur and his friends deceive the farmer and excavate the Etruscan grave goods for themselves. The tombaroli continue to rob tombs, collecting artifacts to sell, and bringing them to Spartaco who runs an illicit operation inside a veterinary clinic. Arthur and Italia grow close after some time, and Arthur expresses romantic interest in her one night as they dance on a beach. The evening is interrupted when Arthur experiences a vision, locating a grave. Upon realizing that Arthur and his friends are graverobbers, Italia threatens to call the police. She asks Arthur what Beniamina would think of him, but the others tell her that Beniamina is dead. Upset, Italia leaves. Inside the tomb, Arthur and his friends discover a statue of Cybele. His friends decapitate the statue to move it out of the tomb, devastating Arthur. Hearing police sirens, the tombaroli flee with the head of the statue, unaware that the sirens were a trick by a rival group attempting to steal the artifacts. Flora's family discovers that Italia was secretly hiding her children in her room and they evict her. Melodie brings the gang to Spartaco, who is her aunt. They find Spartaco on a boat, running an auction to sell the rest of the statue, which she estimates is of invaluable worth. The tombaroli attempt to bargain with her by using the head as blackmail. Arthur reveals the head to her, but has a change of heart and tosses it overboard and into the water. Furious with Arthur, his gang parts ways with him. Out on the streets after his hut is taken down by police, Arthur runs into Italia's daughter, Colombina. She takes him to her mother, who is now living in an abandoned train station with other single mothers. The two reconcile and share a kiss, only for him to leave again in the morning. Arthur joins the group of tomb robbers who previously pretended to be police. After locating a tunnel and at the insistence of the group, Arthur reluctantly enters. The shaft crumbles behind him, trapping him inside. He has a final vision where he reunites with Beniamina.",

    "Synopsis": "In 2015, actress Elizabeth Berry arrives in Savannah, Georgia, to research her upcoming role in an independent film. Elizabeth will be playing Gracie Atherton-Yoo, who, in 1992 at the age of 36, was caught raping 13-year-old Joe Yoo, a schoolmate of her son Georgie, at the pet store where they both worked. During a prison sentence, Gracie gave birth to Joe's child. Twenty-three years later, Gracie and Joe are married with three children: Honor, who is at college, and twins Charlie and Mary, who are about to graduate from high school. Elizabeth interviews Gracie and Joe about their relationship. Visiting the pet store where the couple met, Elizabeth sees the stock room where Gracie and Joe were caught having sex and reenacts the scene alone. She speaks with Tom, Gracie's first husband; Georgie, who is now a musician; and Gracie's defense lawyer. They view Gracie in varying ways, depicting her as naïve and passive, but also show how destructive her actions were. Joe engages in a private text conversation with an unnamed friend who shares his hobby of rearing monarch butterflies. At one point, he proposes they take a vacation together, but she rebuffs him by reminding him he is married. At the accommodation she is staying in, Elizabeth talks with the film's director and suggests the film cast a \"sexier\" actor for the 13-year-old character of Joe after she views auditions of prospective co-stars. Elizabeth participates in a Q&A at the twins' high school and discusses the intimacy actors and crew members feel when shooting a sex scene. When Elizabeth says she enjoys playing morally ambiguous characters, Mary is visibly offended. At home, Charlie shares a cannabis joint with Joe, who reveals to his son that he has never tried cannabis before. High, Joe has a breakdown and weeps in Charlie's arms. The family, accompanied by Elizabeth, celebrate the twins' graduation at a restaurant, where they have an awkward encounter with Tom, Georgie, and the rest of Gracie's old family. Georgie proposes that Elizabeth get him a job as a music supervisor on the film in exchange for details about Gracie's life; he claims he read Gracie's diary and discovered that her older brothers sexually abused her. Georgie also threatens that if not given the job, he will disparage the film to the press when it is released. Elizabeth gets a ride home from Joe. Elizabeth invites Joe to her accommodation, where he gives her a letter Gracie wrote him when he was young. Elizabeth tells Joe that he still has time to start a new life, after which they have sex. Joe leaves after she refers to his experiences as a \"story,\" saying that story is \"his life.\" Elizabeth then reads aloud the letter Joe gave her, adapting Gracie's mannerisms and lisps as she does so. Joe tearfully confronts Gracie about their relationship, wondering whether he was \"too young.\" Gracie insists he seduced her, and repeatedly asks who was really in control. The morning of graduation, one of Joe's butterflies emerges from its chrysalis. Later, the whole family watches Charlie and Mary graduate while Joe weeps alone in the crowd. As Elizabeth prepares to leave, Gracie tells her Georgie fabricated the story of abuse by her brothers. On set of the film, Elizabeth films multiple takes of a scene depicting Gracie seducing Joe at the pet store. While the director is satisfied, she asks to film another take, insisting that the scene is \"getting more real\".",

    "Synopsis": "Saori Mugino is a single mother raising her fifth grade son, Minato. He soon begins exhibiting strange behavior such as cutting his own hair and coming home with only one shoe. One night, Minato does not come home at all and after calling around, Saori finds him in an abandoned train tunnel. Saori begins to suspect that her son's teacher, Mr. Hori, is abusing him and confronts the school about it. She is treated coldly by the faculty, culminating in Hori making a disingenuous apology. When she confronts Hori directly, he asserts that Minato is actually bullying another student named Yori. Saori visits Yori's house and he, despite his own strange behavior, seems fond of and concerned for Minato. Hori is eventually fired from the school, but returns days later and Minato falls down a flight of stairs trying to escape from him. Hori later comes to Saori and Minato's house during a rain storm, but Saori finds that Minato has gone missing. A flashback returns to the beginning of the film from Hori's point of view. He notices Minato exhibiting disruptive behavior, such as throwing other students' belongings around the classroom and seemingly locking Yori in a bathroom stall. Hori too visits Yori's house, where he discovers that his father, Kiyotaka, is an abusive alcoholic. When Saori begins inquiring about her son, the faculty pressure Hori to let them handle it to protect the reputation of the school, ultimately requiring him to resign. After he is hounded by journalists and left by his girlfriend, Hori returns to the school to confront Minato, and contemplates jumping from the roof of the school after the boy falls down the stairs. During the rainstorm, Hori notices a pattern in Yori's old homework that seems to spell out Minato's name. Realizing the two boys were actually in love, Hori rushes to the Mugino household to apologize and assure him nothing is wrong with him. When Saori tells him Minato is missing, they go to the train tunnel to find him. They find an abandoned railcar nearly buried in mud, but only see Minato's poncho inside. A final flashback begins from Minato's point of view. Yori is routinely picked on by the other boys for his asocial and seemingly effeminate behavior. Yori plays with Minato's hair, which the latter then impulsively cuts off. The two boys grow close, but Minato acts harshly toward Yori in the presence of other bullies. Hori confuses Minato's behaviors for bullying. As the two become closer, Minato is distressed that his feelings are becoming romantic and that he is not a worthy son to his deceased father. One night when he goes to Yori's house, Yori and Kiyotaka declare that Yori has been \"cured\", though Yori quickly recants, which incites his father's wrath. The school's headmistress, coming to terms with her involvement in her grandchild's death, encourages Minato to choose happiness. During the rainstorm, Minato finds Yori fully clothed in his bathtub, covered in bruises, and the two escape to the abandoned railcar, which has become their hideout. After the rain subsides, they emerge from the bottom of the railcar and question whether they have been reborn, and run through a field together. In the distance, a path the two wanted to take earlier that was gated off is now gate-free, with no wreckage in sight.",

    "Synopsis": "Hirayama works as a public toilet cleaner for The Tokyo Toilet project in Tokyo's upscale Shibuya district, across town from his modest home in a middle-class neighbourhood east of the Sumida River. He repeats his structured, repetitive routine each day, starting at dawn. His pride in his work is apparent by its thoroughness and precision. He dedicates his free time to his passion for music cassettes, which he listens to in his van to and from work, and to his books (Faulkner, Kōda, Highsmith), which he reads every night before going to sleep. His dreams are shown in flickery impressionistic black-and-white sequences at the end of every day. Hirayama is also fond of trees and spends time gardening and photographing trees. He eats a sandwich every day in the shade under trees in the grounds of a shrine, and takes film photos of their branches and leaves and the 'Komorebi' (木漏れ日) – sunlight filtered by the leaves. Hirayama's love of trees is contrasted with the repeated appearance of the Tokyo Skytree during his drives and bike rides through the city. Hirayama's young assistant, Takashi, is often late, loud, and not as thorough. One day, a young woman named Aya calls on Takashi at the toilet he is cleaning, so he hurries to finish. He tries to leave with Aya, but his motorbike will not start, so he persuades Hirayama to let him use his van. When Aya says Takashi can stay with her as she works at a girls bar, he complains that he is broke. Unbeknownst to Hirayama, Takashi slips Hirayama's Patti Smith tape into Aya's purse. Takashi talks Hirayama into going into a shop to get some of his cassettes appraised. When Takashi discovers they are valuable, he urges Hirayama to sell but Hirayama refuses, giving him some cash so he can take Aya out. When Hirayama runs out of fuel, he is forced to sell a cassette for fuel money. Hirayama commences a tic-tac-toe game with a stranger after finding a piece of paper left hidden in a stall. The game continues over the course of the film. He exchanges furtive glances with a woman eating lunch one bench over. Aya catches up with Hirayama to return his cassette. She asks to play it in his van one last time, and then gives him a thank-you kiss on the cheek, leaving him visibly startled. On his free day, Hirayama does his laundry, takes the film with his tree photos to be developed, cleans his flat, buys a new book, and dines at a restaurant where the proprietor shares gossip with him. Niko, Hirayama's niece, shows up unannounced, having run away from his wealthy estranged sister Keiko's home. Hirayama lets Niko accompany him to work during the next two days. They photograph the trees in the park and ride bikes together. Eventually, Keiko comes to pick up Niko in a chauffeured car. Keiko tells him that their father's dementia has worsened and asks whether Hirayama will visit him in the nursing home where he lives. She says that he does not recognise anything anymore and will not behave the way he did before. Hirayama sorrowfully refuses but hugs his sister goodbye. Before she leaves, she asks him whether he really cleans toilets for a living, and he says yes. As they drive away, Hirayama begins to cry inconsolably. The next day, Takashi quits without giving notice, leaving Hirayama to cover his shift. Later, as Hirayama goes to his usual restaurant, he sees the proprietor embracing a man. Hirayama hurries off, buying cigarettes and three bottled highballs to consume at a nearby riverbank. The man Hirayama saw at the restaurant approaches and asks him for a cigarette. The man tells him the restaurant proprietor is his ex-wife whom he had not seen in seven years, and that she opened her restaurant the year after divorcing him. He says he visited her to make peace before he dies of cancer, telling Hirayama to look after her. Hirayama lightens the mood by offering him a drink and inviting him to play shadow tag, and they eventually part ways. The following morning, Hirayama begins another workweek. As he drives his van and listens to Nina Simone sing \"Feeling Good\", a range of powerful emotions wash over his face.",

    "Synopsis": "On a country estate in France in 1889, Eugénie works as a cook for Dodin, a gourmet who delights in her cooking. Eugénie and Dodin, along with her assistant Violette and Violette's young niece Pauline, who is visiting for the day, prepare an intricate meal for Dodin's friends. The group meets regularly to eat and enjoy food and praise Eugénie for her artistry. Their appreciation for her cooking is contrasted with their disappointment in a garish and discordant eight-hour meal prepared by a visiting prince's chef to which they are later invited. Eugénie and Dodin, both middle-aged, are in a long-term romantic relationship, but maintain separate bedrooms; he has asked her to marry him several times, but she declines, preferring that they maintain their relationship as they are. They find joy in developing new recipes and preparations together. Eugénie suggests to the parents of Pauline, who has considerable gastronomic talent for a child, that she train Pauline as a cook, but they demur. Dodin plans to invite the prince to a meal for which he will prepare a menu revolving around a classic, yet simple, dish, the pot-au-feu. Eugénie experiences several fainting spells, and Dodin grows worried about her health. His doctor friend, Rabaz, is unable to determine the cause, and Eugénie persistently claims she is fine. After one such episode, Dodin cooks an intricate meal for her with great dedication and concludes with an engagement ring hidden in a dessert. She finally accepts Dodin's proposal, and they plan to marry in the \"autumn of their lives\". However, one morning, Dodin wakes to find that Eugénie has died in her sleep. Dodin mourns Eugénie and becomes melancholic, refusing to eat. Pauline's parents arrive to inform him that Pauline, also affected by the death of Eugénie, is intent on learning from him, but he refuses. When his friends secretly send a cook to prepare him an omelette that Eugénie had often made him, he sends the cook away in fury. Eventually, he begins interviewing cooks to work for him and prepare the prince's menu, assisted by Pauline. After several unsuccessful interviews, one of his friends brings him a dish made by a cook working nearby. Excited, Dodin and his friend go to meet the cook, bringing Pauline along. In a flashback, Eugénie and Dodin discuss their relationship, and she asks if she is his cook or his wife. He replies that she is his cook, to her satisfaction.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1943, Rudolf Höss, commandant of the German Auschwitz concentration camp, lives with his wife Hedwig and their five children in an idyllic home next to the camp. Höss takes the children out to swim and fish, and Hedwig spends time tending the garden. Non-Jewish inmates handle the chores, and the murdered Jews' best belongings are given to the family. Beyond the garden wall, gunshots, screaming, and the sounds of trains and furnaces are often audible. Höss approves the design of a new crematorium created by Topf and Sons. One day, he notices human remains in the river and gets his children out of the water where they have been playing. On another day, he chastises SS personnel for damaging lilac bushes around the camp. At night, while Höss reads the German fairytale of \"Hansel and Gretel\" to his daughters, a Polish girl sneaks out and hides food at the prisoners' work sites. Hedwig's mother comes to stay, and is impressed and pleased by the material status her daughter has achieved. Höss receives word that he is being promoted to deputy inspector of concentration camps and must move to Oranienburg, near Berlin. He objects, and withholds the news from Hedwig for several days. Hedwig asks him to convince his superiors to let her and the children remain in their home; the request is approved. Before Höss leaves, a woman comes to his office and prepares herself for sex. Meanwhile, the Polish girl finds sheet music composed by a prisoner, which she plays on the piano at her home. Hedwig's mother departs unannounced after seeing and smelling the burning crematoria at night. She leaves a note that upsets Hedwig, causing Hedwig to lash out and threaten her servants. In Berlin, in recognition of Höss's work, Oswald Pohl tells him he will be heading Aktion Höss that will transport 700,000 Hungarian Jews to his camp to be killed. This will allow him to move back to Auschwitz and reunite with his family. He vacantly attends a party organised by the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office. Afterwards, he tells Hedwig over the phone that he spent his time at the party thinking about the most efficient way to gas the attendees. As Höss leaves his Berlin office and descends a stairway, he stops, retches repeatedly and stares into the darkness of the building corridors. In the present day, a group of janitors clean the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum. Back in 1944, Höss continues downstairs, descending into darkness.",

Every year, young people leave their rural villages and migrate to the manufacturing town. The workers are in their twenties, some in their thirties. They sleep upstairs, in dormitories, because they come from far away, sometimes over 2,000 kilometres. Their dialects come from different regions. They work tirelessly with the hope of one day having children, buying a house or starting their own business. Friendships and romances fold and unfold as the seasons pass. Geographical dispersion, financial instability, and economic and family pressures ravish their innocence and youth. Wang Bing will spend a year with them in Zhili: at work, at home, on the Internet, every day of their professional, romantic relationships and friendships.",

    "Synopsis": "Anora \"Ani\" Mikheeva, a 23-year-old stripper, lives in Brighton Beach, a Russian-American neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York City. Her boss introduces her to Ivan \"Vanya\" Zakharov, the 21-year-old son of the Russian oligarch Nikolai Zakharov, who requests someone fluent in Russian. Though Vanya is in the U.S. to study, he spends most of his time partying in clubs and playing video games in his parents' lavish Brooklyn mansion. Vanya hires Ani for several sexual encounters. He invites her to a New Year's Eve party at the mansion, and the following day, he offers her $15,000 to be his girlfriend for a week. During the week, Ani parties with Vanya and his friends, and they all go on an extravagant trip to Las Vegas. At the end of the trip, Vanya reveals that he has to return to Russia permanently to work at his father's company and expresses disdain for his parents. He suggests that he will not have to leave if he marries an American and impulsively proposes marriage. Ani is reluctant at first but agrees after Vanya assures her that his feelings are genuine. They elope at a Vegas wedding chapel. Vanya then buys her a large wedding ring and an expensive fur coat. She resigns from her job and moves into Vanya's mansion. When news of their marriage reaches Russia, Vanya's mother, Galina, orders his Armenian godfather, Toros, to find them and arrange an annulment while she and his father, Nikolai, fly to the U.S. Toros sends his henchmen, Garnik and Igor, to the mansion. They inform Vanya that his parents are taking him back to Russia and enrage Ani by calling her a prostitute, suggesting Vanya only married her for a green card. Vanya flees the premises, and Ani engages in a violent struggle with Garnik and Igor before they restrain her. When Toros arrives, he tells Ani that Vanya's mansion and wealth belong to his parents and that he is immature and financially dependent on them. He confiscates her wedding ring, gags her, and offers her $10,000 for the annulment. Ani insists she and Vanya are in love, but she agrees to help find him. Ani, Toros, Garnik, and Igor search Brooklyn. Ani learns from friends that Vanya is at her former strip club, where he is being entertained by Diamond, a rival dancer. They drag Vanya out of the club, but he is too intoxicated to listen to them, and the group is forced to wait outside the courthouse overnight. The annulment is dismissed since the marriage took place in Nevada. At the airport, Ani introduces herself to Nikolai and Galina in Russian, but Galina rejects her. Conceding to his parents, Vanya coldly tells Ani their marriage must end while Galina orders everyone onto a plane to Las Vegas. Having not signed a prenuptial agreement, Ani pledges to file for a divorce settlement, but Galina threatens her with financial ruin if she does not comply. Realizing Vanya's cowardice and his family's power, Ani signs the annulment papers. Igor suggests Vanya apologize to Ani, but Galina objects. Ani insults both Vanya and Galina before leaving, telling Galina that Vanya only got married to spite her. Igor takes Ani back to New York to collect her belongings. At the mansion, she confronts Igor about their encounter, accusing him of assault and saying he would have raped her if they had been alone, though Igor assures her that he had no intention of doing so. The next morning, Igor gives Ani the money Toros promised her and drives her home. In the car, he returns her wedding ring as a token of goodwill. Ani initiates sex with him but stops when he tries to kiss her; she breaks down and sobs in his arms.",

    "Synopsis": "Bailey is a twelve year old girl who lives in a run-down building with her father, Bug, and half brother, Hunter. One day, Bug announces his engagement to Kayleigh, a woman he has known for three months with their wedding on the following Saturday. Bailey, in shock and frustration, claims she will not attend and storms off. Later that day, Hunter tells Bailey he is in a vigilante group with his friends. Intrigued, Bailey follows them and witnesses the group of boys storm into a house and threaten a man with a box cutter. Police are quickly called and Bailey escapes into an empty field where she falls asleep for the night. The next morning, she is greeted by a mysterious man who calls himself Bird. She follows him to an apartment complex where he searches for a woman who lived there sometime ago, but has little luck finding her. Bailey leaves after this, but notices Bird on the roof of the building before Bug arrives to take her home and grounds her for being out all night. Bailey learns that Bird was looking for his mother who lived in the apartment complex, and that long ago she disappeared when he was a child. Warming to Bird, Bailey suggests her mother, Peyton, could help Bird as she lived in the complex years ago. At Peyton’s house, Bailey and Bird inquire about the residents, but are interrupted by the attitude of her live-in boyfriend, Skate. An argument ensues between Bailey and Skate, leading Bailey to film him, with Skate threatening to kill Peyton if Bailey shows the footage to the authorities. Despite this, Peyton is able to remember Bird's father's name. Bailey sends the video to Hunter, promising Bailey he and his group will attack Skate in order to rescue her mother along with her half-siblings. Later, Hunter requests Bailey’s assistance in delivering a note to his girlfriend Moon asking that the two run away to Scotland, due to her family’s disapproval of her recently discovered pregnancy. On the way, a crow follows Bailey and helps her slip the note past Moon’s family. The next day as Hunter and his friends plan their attack, Bailey takes her half-siblings out for the day to avoid the incident. Bird reappears to help Bailey and the kids to the beach where he attempts to track down his father. When they find his apartment, the man living there denies ever having a son to Bird and Bailey. Later, the man recants his denial and admits to Bird that he was with Bird's mother and they did have a boy, but left shortly after, unable to deal with her poor mental state. Bailey consoles a tearful Bird as the group heads back home. Soon after their return, Skate attempts to barge into their house. Peyton is unsuccessful in stopping him, leading to him assaulting her. Bailey attempts to stop him, but Skate knocks her unconscious. Bird re-enters the apartment and also attempts to defend Peyton, but Skate bashes his head in. While recovering, Bailey witnesses Bird transform into a creature with feathers, large wings, and bird-like eyes. He fights Skate again, this time taking him outside, where Bird knocks him unconscious, grabs him with talons and flies off with his body. The next morning Bailey discovers that Hunter has left home. She informs Bug and the two run to the train station and discover him alone, devastated that Moon did not follow through with his plans. Bug comforts Hunter, telling him he is too young for parenthood. The three of them ride back home and attend the wedding of Bug and Kayleigh, with Bailey in better spirits about the ceremony. During the reception, Bird shows up unannounced and hugs Bailey goodbye. As he leaves, Bailey's eyes are revealed to be bird-like in the same manner that Bird's eyes were.",

    "Synopsis": "Rita Mora Castro, a struggling attorney in Mexico City, leads the defense in a murder case involving a prominent media figure's wife. Against her own conscience, Rita proceeds to argue that the woman died by suicide (\"El alegato\"). After winning the case, Rita receives an anonymous call with a mysterious but lucrative offer. Reflecting on her discontent, she agrees to a meeting (\"Todo y nada\"). Her client, revealed to be cartel kingpin Juan \"Manitas\" Del Monte, expresses the desire to covertly undergo gender-affirming surgery and begin a new and authentic life (\"El encuentro\") as a woman. After consulting with doctors in Bangkok (\"La vaginoplastia\") and Tel Aviv (\"Lady\"), Rita finds a surgeon who agrees to perform the procedure after hearing Manitas's recollections of gender dysphoria during childhood (\"Deseo\"). Following the procedure, Manitas's wife, Jessi, and their children are relocated to Switzerland. Jessi pleads to go to the United States to be with her sister instead, but she is told that Switzerland was chosen for their safety. Rita is paid an exorbitant sum for her services. Meanwhile, Manitas fakes their death and begins a new life as Emilia Pérez. Four years later in London, Rita encounters Emilia, who wants to reunite with her children (\"Por casualidad\"). Rita arranges for Jessi and the children to return to Mexico City to live with Emilia, introducing her as a distant, wealthy cousin of Manitas who has volunteered to help raise the children. Jessi does not recognize Emilia and opposes the arrangement, ultimately agreeing to return to Mexico only to reunite with Gustavo Brun, a past lover with whom she had an affair during the later years of her marriage (\"Bienvenida\"). Adjusting to their new life in Mexico, Rita and Emilia have a chance encounter with the mother of a missing child. Emilia reflects on her criminal past (\"Mis siete hermanos y yo\"). Later, as she is putting her son to bed, he says he still recognizes her scent (\"Papá\"). Remorseful, Emilia uses her connections with incarcerated cartel members to create a nonprofit that identifies the bodies of cartel victims (\"Para\") in order to return them to their families. Rita and Emilia collaborate in building the nonprofit and recruiting donors, some of whom, Rita notes, are dangerous and corrupt (\"El mal\"). Epifanía, a woman whose abusive husband's remains were identified by the nonprofit, meets with Emilia to confirm his death. The two subsequently begin a relationship (\"El amor\"). Meanwhile, Jessi continues rekindling her relationship with Gustavo (\"Mi camino\"). She tells Emilia that the two plan to marry and move the family to a new home. When Emilia refers to the children as \"mine\" and becomes physically aggressive, Jessi flees with the children. After Emilia cuts off Jessi's allowance and threatens Gustavo into leaving Mexico, Jessi and Gustavo kidnap Emilia and demand ransom from Rita. She receives a package with a few of Emilia's severed fingers. Arriving at the designated location, Rita attempts to negotiate with Gustavo, but a shootout ensues with the security team Rita has hired to rescue Emilia. Emilia finally reveals her true identity to Jessi, recounting intimate details of their first meeting and their wedding day (\"Perdóname\"). Gustavo and a confused Jessi load Emilia into the trunk of Gustavo's car and drive off. As Jessi slowly realizes what has happened, she becomes guilt-ridden and orders Gustavo to pull over, holding him at gunpoint. As the two struggle for the gun, the car veers off the road, killing Gustavo, Jessi, and Emilia. Rita, devastated over Emilia's death, tells Jessi's children what has happened and offers to be their guardian. Epifanía marches in the street singing Emilia's eulogy and celebrating her fight for truth and freedom (\"Las damas que pasan\").",

    "film_title": "Kinds of Kindness",
    "Synopsis": "Structured as a \"triptych fable\", Kinds of Kindness consists of three distinct but loosely connected stories: Robert Fletcher follows every order from his domineering boss and lover, Raymond. Raymond controls every aspect of Robert's life, including setting him up with his wife Sarah, buying their house and car, and dictating when they can have sexual intercourse. One day, Raymond orders Robert to crash his car to kill \"R.M.F.\", a man known only by his initials. They survive with minor injuries. When Raymond orders him to try again, Robert confesses his fear and unwillingness to try again, but Raymond insists. Robert refuses again, which angers Raymond and causes him to fire Robert, stating Robert is \"free now\". Robert's life then falls apart. A prized smashed John McEnroe tennis racquet, given by Raymond as a gift, is taken from his house. In his despondence, Robert confesses to Sarah that Raymond paid doctors to supply abortifacients with the intention of unknowingly posing as miscarriages and ovarian issues; Sarah abandons him, quitting her job and disappearing. Desperate, Robert grovels to Raymond for another chance but is aggressively rebuffed. While trying to regain Raymond's respect, Robert meets Rita, a woman whose life Robert quickly discovers is also being controlled by Raymond. After Rita was also tasked with crashing into and killing R.M.F., she ends up in the hospital, with R.M.F. in critical condition. In a last-ditch effort, Robert kidnaps R.M.F., dumping him in the hospital valet drop-off and repeatedly running him over with his car and killing him. Robert then arrives at Raymond's mansion. Robert embraces Raymond and Vivian, Raymond's live-in lover, on the couch. Raymond states that he knew that Robert would not disappoint him. Police officer Daniel is mourning the disappearance of his wife Liz, a marine biologist who went missing at sea, when he receives news that she has been rescued in a helicopter piloted by R.M.F. Liz miraculously returns unharmed to Daniel, but many things about her are strange; her behavior and interests seem to be the opposite of how she was before, their pet cat acts aggressive towards her, and her feet no longer fit in her shoes, leading Daniel to become suspicious of her. Amid his paranoia about Liz, she tells Daniel she is pregnant. He orders her to leave and threatens arrest if she refuses. Daniel's paranoia escalates during a traffic stop, where he acts erratically, shoots a passenger in the hand, then licks the wound. As a result, he is suspended from the police force and prescribed antipsychotics. Liz recounts to her father a dream she experienced the previous night, in which dogs were the dominant species and kept humans like Liz as pets, being fed chocolate, a food she previously hated but ate due to there being large quantities of such. She concludes that it is better to rely on something consistently available rather than something that depletes each day. Homebound and still unconvinced of Liz's identity, Daniel starts starving himself and then orders Liz to mutilate herself in various ways. First, Daniel asks for one of Liz's fingers or thumb to eat, so she severs her thumb and serves it to Daniel to eat. Daniel then tells his doctor Liz mutilated herself of her own volition and claims she began punching herself in the stomach and face. At a gynecologist's office, Liz is found to have miscarried and claims that Daniel in fact hit her after she talked back, blaming it on the antipsychotics. Later, Daniel demands more food, suggesting her liver. Liz complies, cuts out her liver, and dies. Another Liz arrives at Daniel's door, and they happily embrace. Over the credits, footage of dogs living like humans is shown. Emily and Andrew are members of a sex cult led by the enigmatic Omi and Aka. The cult's ritual for cleansing involves sweating out \"toxins\" in a high-temperature sauna if accused of infidelity with anyone other than Omi or Aka, with Aka licking the sweat from their navel to determine if they are cleansed. Emily and Andrew are looking for a specific woman with the ability to reanimate the dead. They examine a candidate named Anna, whom they find to be unsuccessful. Emily secretly makes regular visits to her estranged husband, Joseph, and their daughter. At the headquarters, Omi gives Emily and Andrew information on another possible candidate, but they discover that she is already dead. Emily believes that the woman they are looking for appeared to her in a dream. While Emily and Andrew are eating at a restaurant, a woman named Rebecca, who resembles the woman Emily dreamed about, approaches them and says she knows who they are. She suggests that her twin sister, Ruth, would be a perfect candidate. Andrew brushes this off, saying that one of the requirements — that the candidate's twin must be deceased — was not met. During a visit to her old home, Emily runs into Joseph and their daughter as she is leaving, and Joseph invites Emily to visit them again. She does, only for Joseph to drug her drinks and rape her while she is unconscious. The morning after, Omi, Aka, and Andrew arrive at Emily's old home and take her to be \"tested\". She is expelled from the cult after being found to be \"contaminated\". As part of a plan to return to the cult, she decides to see Ruth. Before leaving, she visits Rebecca, who called earlier to say that she would be able to meet one of the requirements. Rebecca kills herself by diving into an empty pool during Emily's visit, fulfilling the prophecy. After visiting Ruth's veterinarian practice and witnessing the spontaneous healing of a dog she examined, Emily knocks her out and brings her to the morgue, where she orders Ruth to bring R.M.F.'s body back to life. Ruth is able to do so, and Emily dances outside her car. Speeding to get to the cult's headquarters, Emily becomes distracted and crashes the car, killing Ruth. In a mid-credits scene, R.M.F. eats a sandwich and spills ketchup on his shirt. A waiter gives him a napkin to clean himself up.",

    "film_title": "Megalopolis (film)",
    "Synopsis": "In an alternate United States, New Rome is dominated by an elite group of patrician families. Although the Roman elite profess to live by a strict moral code, patricians decadently enjoy forbidden pleasures while ordinary Romans live in poverty. Patrician architect Cesar Catilina is one of New Rome's leading lights. Cesar wins the Nobel Prize for inventing the revolutionary building material Megalon. In addition, he can secretly stop time. Despite Cesar's worldly success, he has fallen into alcoholism. Years earlier, his wife disappeared, and District Attorney Franklyn Cicero prosecuted him for murdering her. Although Cesar was acquitted, he remains crushed by guilt, believing his wife committed suicide because he was too focused on his work. Cesar pines for his wife, prompting his jealous mistress, TV presenter Wow Platinum, to leave him. At a televised event, Cesar and now-Mayor Cicero offer different visions for the city's future. Cesar proposes using Megalon to build \"Megalopolis\", a utopian urbanist community, while Cicero argues that a casino will provide immediate tax revenue. Cesar meets Cicero's well-read but purposeless daughter Julia. Earlier, she watched Cesar stop time while a building was being demolished but was still able to move. Initially, they dislike each other, but Cesar impresses Julia with his vision for Megalopolis, explaining that New Rome needs a grand artistic vision to free itself from its political inertia and unlock its full potential. Later, when Cesar cannot stop time as he once could, Julia encourages him to do so for her. They discover they can stop time when together, and the two become lovers. Wow marries Cesar's uncle Hamilton Crassus III, the world's richest man. Although Crassus likes his nephew, his mind and health are in decline, and he is easily manipulated by individuals like his other nephew, Clodio Pulcher, who wants to inherit the Crassus bank. Crassus and Wow throw a decadent wedding reception. The headliner is teenage pop star Vesta Sweetwater, who appeals to New Rome's puritanical sensibilities by promising to remain chaste until marriage. To neutralize Cesar, Pulcher leaks a paparazzi video of Cesar having sex with Vesta, prompting Cicero to condemn Cesar in a speech drawn from the real-life Catilinarian orations. Although Cicero arrests Cesar for statutory rape, Julia exonerates Cesar by discovering that Vesta faked her age and is actually in her twenties. Soviet satellite Carthage crashes to Earth, destroying much of New Rome. Cesar begins building Megalopolis in the ruins, financing the project with his family fortune. In a press conference, he makes the case for bold artistic projects that show people that a better world is possible. However, the cost of building Megalopolis contrasts with poverty on the streets. Pulcher becomes a populist politician, encouraging ordinary Romans to oppose Megalopolis as an expensive folly. The allure of power draws Pulcher from populism to fascist demagoguery. A pregnant Julia tries to broker peace between Cesar and Cicero by taking her father to see the Megalopolis construction site, but Cicero is unimpressed with Cesar's utopianism, and he begs Cesar to leave Julia. In exchange, he offers Cesar valuable blackmail material: a confession that Cicero knew Cesar's wife committed suicide and maliciously prosecuted Cesar anyway. Cesar declines. Pulcher's right-hand man hires an assassin to kill Cesar, but Cesar's doctors use Megalon to rebuild his skull. Wow tries to force Cesar to leave Julia and marry her by freezing Cesar's account at the Crassus bank. She enlists Pulcher to manipulate Crassus into handing over control of the bank. When Crassus learns of Pulcher's duplicity, he has a stroke and collapses. Pulcher and Wow taunt the bedridden Crassus, but Crassus kills Wow and injures Pulcher with a hidden bow and arrow. Rioting Pulcher supporters attempt to storm Megalopolis and City Hall. Cesar confronts the rioters, pleading with them to believe in his vision of a better future, while Cicero watches. Cesar's speech inspires the crowd, who go on to hang Pulcher upside down, mirroring the death of Benito Mussolini. With renewed financial support from Crassus, Cesar finally completes Megalopolis. Cicero, holding Julia and Cesar's baby daughter, Sunny Hope, promises to help Cesar build a better future. On New Year's Eve, Julia stops time, but only the baby seems unaffected, leaving her the only one moving.",

    "film_title": "Oh, Canada (film)",
    "Synopsis": "Filmmaker Leonard \"Leo\" Fife is dying of cancer. He is a hero to Canadian progressives, who revere his award-winning muckraking documentaries and are fascinated by his life story. According to legend, Leo fled America for Montreal to dodge the Vietnam War draft, and went on a Kerouac-style road trip to Castro's communist Cuba. In his last days, he agrees to sit for a CBC documentary filmed by his former students Malcolm and Diana. Malcolm promises that he is making an admiring retrospective of Leo’s career. Over the years, Leo has lied to the public many times and abandoned many women. He sees the documentary as an opportunity to confess his sins to his wife Emma, another former student of his. Although Malcolm initially wants to focus on Leo's films, Leo dismissively explains that he became a filmmaker by accident and often drifts into remembering his early life. Before moving to Canada, Leo, an aspiring novelist, lives in Virginia with his pregnant wife Alicia and son Cornel. His wife's wealthy parents live nearby. Although Alicia prefers to stay in Virginia, he feels stifled by his in-laws’ gentility and traditional values, and hopes a change of scenery will revitalize his writing. As such, although the University of Virginia wants him to stay, he accepts a job at Goddard College in Vermont, hiding the UVA offer from Alicia. To get him to stay in Virginia, his father-in-law offers to train him to run the family business and gives him a week to decide. In the meantime, Leo travels to Vermont to buy a house near the college, which Alicia's parents are paying for. It becomes clear that Leo abandoned his wife and son when fleeing to Canada. In voiceover, presumably recorded by Malcolm for his documentary, an adult Cornel explains that he did not see his father for 30 years. To save her husband's reputation, Emma tries to stop the interview, explaining that Leo is mentally unstable due to his illness and use of prescription fentanyl. However, Leo and Malcolm—who realizes he has a Leo-style exposé on his hands—both insist on continuing. Leo recalls more embarrassing moments from his past: he stole from a family friend who gave him a job after he dropped out of college; seduced both Diana and Emma while teaching them; cheated on his first wife while she was pregnant; and lied to the public about visiting Cuba. Emma recalls that when an adult Cornel introduced himself to his father at a film festival, Leo harshly told him that he had no son to avoid embarrassment. Emma met with Cornel privately, but declined his request to stay in touch, preferring to avoid reminders of her husband's past. Leo revisits his final drive to the Canadian border. He visits his old friend Stanley, and is dismayed to hear that moving to Vermont did not revitalize Stanley’s painting career. That evening, Leo is informed that Alicia miscarried. Even so, he accepts when Stanley's wife Gloria (whom Stanley admits cheating on) sexually propositions him that night. Emma ends the interview when Leo begins to die. Malcolm's assistant plants a hidden camera to record his last words: \"Oh, Canada,\" after the national anthem. Leo remembers dodging the draft by pretending to be gay, meaning that he left America for other reasons. His mind flickers to the moment he crossed the Canadian border. His younger self raises his arms to the sun and walks to a new life.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1950, the affluent Di Sangro family awaits the birth of their daughter in the waters of Posillipo. The birth is attended by her wealthy godfather Achille Lauro, her older brother Raimondo, and Sandrino, the son of the family's housekeeper. Achille gives her the name Parthenope in honour of the city of Naples. In 1968, Sandrino is obsessed with Parthenope, and Raimondo is incestuously attached to her. Parthenope attends an anthropology course taught by Professor Devoto Marotta, known for his severity. She challenges Marotta during an evaluation of her knowledge and they develop mutual respect. In 1973, Raimondo suggests to Parthenope and Sandrino that they go to Capri. Parthenope’s carefree behaviour attracts the attention of many people, including the writer John Cheever, whose work she has read. Raimondo ingratiates himself with an heiress, but cannot kiss her and realises he loves only Parthenope. After seeing Sandrino seduce Parthenope, Raimondo throws himself from the cliffs of Capri. In 1974, Parthenope's mother blames her for Raimondo's death and her father becomes completely detached. She asks Marotta to advise her on an anthropology dissertation about suicide. He instead suggests researching the cultural impact of miracles. Parthenope briefly interrupts her studies and tries to become an actress. First, she sees the acting teacher Flora Malva, an elderly diva who directs her to Greta Cool, an actress who shares Parthenope's Neapolitan origins. At a party in Greta's honour, Parthenope meets Roberto Criscuolo, a mafioso who takes her to a family ritual, in which the heirs of two Camorra families conceive a child to mark unity. Parthenope then becomes pregnant by Criscuolo, but privately procures an illegal abortion. Sandrino later arrives to bid her farewell before moving to Milan, and she lashes out, blaming him for Raimondo's death. In 1982, Parthenope is a university scholar. She receives an invitation from an anthropology journal to write an article on the liquefaction of the blood of San Gennaro. Marotta warns her about Cardinal Tesorone, who oversees the miracle, calling him a \"scoundrel\". Tesorone asks her to have sex with him and Parthenope agrees. Marotta tells Parthenope that he aims to retire, and suggests that she apply for a teaching position at the University of Trento. At first Parthenope refuses, because of her love for Naples. Marotta introduces her to his severely disabled son. Parthenope seems compelled by his son, but remains in Trento. In 2023, as she is retiring from academia, Parthenope discusses with two students the profound impact she had on their lives and briefly answers some of their questions about her personal life. She visits Capri, remembering her youth, then returns to Naples. Parthenope smiles as a passing group of fans celebrate SSC Napoli’s third Serie A championship.",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. --> In 1973, the young Donald Trump, after pointing out various wealthy people to his date, meets Roy Cohn, notorious at the time as former chief counsel to Joseph McCarthy, at a New York City social club. Trump complains that the federal government is investigating his real-estate mogul father, Fred Trump, for discrimination against African-American tenants; Cohn offers to help. After Cohn blackmails the lead prosecutor with photos of him with a cabana boy, the prosecutor settles the case for little, despite evidence of racial discrimination. Trump eventually descends further into Cohn's orbit, seeing him as a better mentor than his father. Cohn teaches Trump about dressing well and media relations, and offers his \"three rules\": always attack, never admit wrongdoing, and always claim victory, even if defeated. Trump attends a decadent Cohn party, where he walks in on Cohn (whose homosexuality is an open secret) having an orgy. Trump wants to develop the derelict midtown Commodore Hotel, near Grand Central Terminal, into a Hyatt. Cohn, using blackmail audiotapes of officials, helps Trump obtain a $160 million tax abatement for the project, outraging advocates for the poor. Trump does not ask Fred, with whom he has a tense relationship, for permission to build. Trump develops the luxurious Trump Tower, belittling Fred's smaller achievements, and the media begins to treat him as a successful mogul. Cohn criticizes unions and welfare queens, presenting himself as a guardian of the American spirit, while attacking rules, morals, and truth. During the Reagan era, Trump says the United States needs to be stronger instead of disrespected by foreign nations. Trump and Roger Stone approve of one of Reagan's slogans, \"Let's Make America Great Again\". Against Cohn's advice, Trump proceeds with some real estate developments, such as the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, causing losses. Fred is ashamed of his eldest son, Fred Jr., for becoming an airline pilot with TWA, considering it akin to being \"a bus driver with wings\". Fred Jr. spirals into alcoholism, derailing his career, while the Trump family distances themselves from his self-destruction, and he eventually dies, devastating the family. His mother, Mary Anne, is agonized by this, and by Donald's attempts to manipulate his father's dementia to gain control of his siblings' inheritance to pay off mounting debts. Trump meets Czech model Ivana Zelníčková, gets her admitted to his club after she is turned away, pays for her expenses, then pursues her to Aspen, Colorado, to ask her on a date. They eventually wed. She becomes an influential figure in the success of The Trump Organization. However, Trump grows resentful of Ivana overshadowing his fame and tells her he is no longer attracted to her (though not mentioning his various affairs). She complains of her breast enlargement he requested and calls him fat and bald, so he rapes her. Now addicted to amphetamines to help control his weight, Donald is discouraged from using them by his doctor, with whom he discusses his obesity and baldness. Trump has contentious relations with the new mayor, Ed Koch. While facing disbarment, Cohn develops AIDS but publicly denies it. His lover Russell also develops AIDS, and Cohn asks Trump to put Russell up at the Hyatt. Trump eventually evicts Russell, claiming that guests complained, and refuses to approach Cohn, who berates Trump on the street, calling him an ungrateful fraud. After Russell dies, Trump takes Cohn to Mar-a-Lago in Florida and celebrates his birthday. He gives Cohn Trump-branded diamond cufflinks, but Ivana informs Cohn during dinner that the diamonds are zirconium knockoffs. When the cake arrives, Cohn weeps and excuses himself from the table. Cohn dies in 1986. Trump undergoes liposuction and scalp-reduction surgeries. He meets with Tony Schwartz, the ghostwriter of his autobiography, The Art of the Deal, and appropriates Cohn's three rules as his own. Trump muses about becoming President of the United States, talks about the genetic superiority of winners, and expatiates his greatness while looking out toward an American flag waving against the backdrop of the New York skyline.",

    "Synopsis": "Copenhagen, 1919: Karoline is unable to apply for widow's compensation because her husband Peter, who has not written back to her since being deployed, has not been officially declared dead. She is forced to move into squalid conditions, working as a seamstress with her friend Frida at a local factory. Peter, who has been brutally mutilated in battle, returns after Karoline has begun a romantic relationship with her boss Jørgen and fallen pregnant. Karoline, disgusted by Peter and optimistic about a life of better conditions with Jørgen, rejects him, but Jørgen's mother forbids the two to be married. Alone and without prospects, Karoline attempts a shoddy abortion with a large needle at the local baths but is stopped by a woman called Dagmar and 7-year-old Erena. Dagmar treats Karoline's wounds and instructs her to bring the baby to her sweets shop, where she secretly runs a business finding homes for unwanted babies. Karoline soon discovers Peter working at a local circus, and the two begin living together again. Meanwhile, Peter is besieged with violent psychotic episodes. Karoline gives birth to a daughter. While Peter wants to keep the baby, sharing he can no longer have any of his own, Karoline takes her to Dagmar's sweets shop. Unable to pay Dagmar's fee, Karoline offers herself up as a wet nurse and begins living at the shop. Karoline settles into her new life, befriending Erena, who she occasionally breastfeeds, and bonding with Dagmar, who seems to share similar feelings of loneliness and guilt. The two women begin recreationally abusing ether together. Dagmar accepts an abandoned baby boy, who she allows Karoline to care for until he can be found a home. As Karoline enjoys her time with him, Frida remains suspicious of Dagmar's operations. One evening, Erena asks to breastfeed. When Karoline rejects her, committed to breastfeeding the baby boy, Erena attempts to smother him, narrowly stopped by Karoline. The next day, Dagmar takes the baby away, claiming to have found him a family. Concerned this is in retaliation for her treatment of Erena, Karoline follows Dagmar and is horrified to witness her throttling the baby to death before dumping his body in a sewer drain. At the sweets shop, Karoline confronts Dagmar, who admits to killing all the babies she has collected, including Karoline's daughter, claiming she does not want to bring up something so innocent in a cruel world. Dagmar begins heavily dosing Karoline with ether. Frida, having learned of Dagmar's services from Karoline, attends a friend dropping her unwanted baby off at the shop but grows ever more uneasy when she glimpses a disoriented Karoline. Dagmar tries to convince Karoline to kill the baby and the two brawl, accidentally smothering the baby to death. Later, the woman returns for her baby, regretting giving it up and threatening to call the police if it isn't returned. As Dagmar panics, Karoline jumps out of a window. Police apprehend Dagmar and send Erena to an orphanage. Karoline, having survived her fall, goes to the traveling circus that Peter now lives with. The two reconcile and Karoline is weaned off of ether with Peter's support. She lies about the fate of her child. Later, Dagmar is tried in court for her crimes, where it is revealed that doctors believe it unlikely that she is young enough to be Erena's biological mother. Dagmar protects Karoline from association and defends her decision to spare the unwanted babies’ lives of poverty. Sometime later, Karoline adopts Erena from the orphanage.",

    "Synopsis": "Iman, a devout and honest lawyer, lives with his wife, Najmeh, and their two daughters, Rezvan and Sana. Iman has recently been appointed as an investigating judge in the Revolutionary Court in Tehran. The position provides him a higher salary and a larger apartment for his family, which his wife wants. As the nationwide political protests against the authoritarian government unfold, Iman discovers that he was not hired to use his legal expertise to investigate cases. He is expected to approve judgments presented to him by his superiors without assessing the evidence, including death sentences, and he learns his predecessor was fired for refusing. The position requires Iman to remain anonymous. He is ordered to withhold information from friends and family who could be targeted as a means of pressuring him. The government issues Iman a handgun for his family's protection, but he is woefully unprepared to handle the gun and fails to properly store it in a secure compartment in the house. When Sadaf, a good friend of Rezvan's, is shot in the face on the street during a demonstration against compulsory hijab, Najmeh and her daughters provide first aid in their apartment. They decide to keep the incident secret from Iman. A short time later, Sadaf is arrested. Najmeh, who is just as devout as Iman, advises her daughters to stay away from their revolutionary friends, putting a strain on the family. As nationwide political protests intensify, Iman becomes mistrustful and paranoid. The protests force him to sign several hundred sentences a day. Meanwhile, Rezvan and Sana follow the protests in horror on social media. Rezvan eventually rebels against her father at dinner, causing Iman to berate her for her feminist sensibilities, which he dismisses as enemy propaganda. At the same time, Iman's handgun mysteriously disappears and he becomes suspicious, believing that someone in his family has taken it and is lying to him. He forces both daughters and his wife to meet with a colleague, Alireza, for interrogation. Iman justifies this treatment by saying that he no longer feels safe in his own home since he can no longer trust his family. Iman's name, photo and address are eventually posted on social media. For their own protection, Iman decides to drive with his family to his childhood home in the mountains. Before he leaves, a colleague gives him a firearm for protection to make up for the one that has disappeared. During the car ride, the family encounters a couple who recognize Iman. A chase ensues, as Iman runs them off the road and threatens them. Inside the car, Sana reveals to Rezvan that she has taken the gun, and Rezvan takes it from her and stows it in the back seat. Upon reaching his childhood home, Iman puts the entire family on trial. He interrogates and tries to force them to confess on a camcorder. Both the girls continue to deny involvement, so Najmeh takes the blame to protect them, but then, to try and protect her mother and sister. Rezvan says that she has the gun, however, when she takes Iman to retrieve it, she discovers that it is missing from the car. Iman locks Rezvan and Najmeh up in separate rooms in the basement, but Sana escapes with the gun. After setting a trap, she is able to lock Iman in a shed and free her sister and mother before he breaks out. Following a lengthy chase scene in the ruins of a town, Iman eventually catches Najmeh, and her screams lead Sana and Rezvan to them. Sana raises her gun at her father, but she hesitates to fire. When her father moves toward her, his second gun in his hand, she panics and shoots the ground beneath him. The ground collapses and Iman falls to his presumed death. The film ends with real footage captured on mobile phones depicting women protesting in the streets of Tehran, hair uncovered, waving their headscarves in the air.",

Several tombstones in the GraveTech cemetery including Becca's are destroyed, and the technology's network is encrypted by hackers, leaving the shrouds unviewable. Terry's ex-husband, Maury, who coded GraveTech's security and created a virtual assistant in Becca's image for Karsh named Hunny, determines the hack originated in Iceland, one of the countries where Karsh plans to expand his business. Viewing screenshots of Becca's corpse, Maury notices strange protrusions on the bones that Karsh believes were caused by her cancer. At the same time, Karsh is accosted by Soo-Min, the blind wife of a CEO who wants to sponsor a GraveTech in Budapest. He begins sleeping with her. Karsh's relationship with Terry turns sexual, with Terry aroused by Karsh's description of sex with Soo-Min and his growing fascination with the conspiracy around GraveTech. As Karsh learns that the hack did not come from Iceland, Maury notices that the destroyed tombstones had their data lines bugged. Soo-Min warns Karsh that Hunny's code was found to be unstable, and the AI takes on Becca's naked, dismembered form as it taunts Karsh about his supposed sexual inferiority to Eckler. Terry shows him a video she covertly took of Maury, whose jealousy of Karsh's relationship with her has caused his schizophrenia to resurface. In the video, he claims to be in full control of Hunny and implies that he was in some way behind the attack on GraveTech. After being called to talk, Karsh meets Maury in the woods, who shows him the bloody remains of his hand after losing two fingers. He claims that he hired a pair of Russian hackers to take over GraveTech's network, which convinced a group working under the CCP, investors in GraveTech who supposedly tapped the data lines, that he could be used as a mole. They tortured him for info on the Russian \"operation\". Terry later claims that he lost the fingers in high school and hides them from everyone. While GraveTech's network is brought back online and the tombstones are repaired, a doctor examining the protrusions on Becca's body informs Karsh that they are artificial. Karsh is shocked to find Eckler's murdered body buried in his spot next to Becca. Terry theorizes about what could have happened to put Eckler there, and when Karsh pretends he hired a hitman to kill and bury Eckler, she becomes aroused. Believing that Becca now has someone to keep her company in death, Karsh willingly gives up his spot and goes with Soo-Min on a jet to Budapest. As they kiss, she suddenly appears to him with identical scars to Becca and, speaking in her voice, offers to be buried with him in Budapest, which he accepts.",

    "film_title": "The Substance",
    "Synopsis": "On her 50th birthday, faded Hollywood film star Elisabeth Sparkle is dismissed from her long-running aerobics TV show by its producer, Harvey, due to her age. Elisabeth crashes her car while distracted by a billboard of herself being taken down. At the hospital, a young male nurse gives her a flash drive advertising \"The Substance\", a black market drug that promises a \"younger, more beautiful, more perfect\" version of oneself. Elisabeth orders The Substance and injects the single-use serum. She convulses as a younger woman named Sue emerges from a slit in her back. The two bodies must switch consciousness every seven days without exception, with the inactive body remaining unconscious and fed intravenously. Daily injections of stabilizer fluid, extracted from the original body, are required to prevent Sue from deteriorating. Sue becomes an overnight sensation after auditioning as Elisabeth's replacement, and Harvey offers her the chance to host the New Year's Eve show. While Sue lives a confident and hedonistic life, Elisabeth becomes a self-hating recluse. Near the end of one weekly cycle, Sue brings a man home for casual sex; she delays the switch by extracting additional stabilizer fluid, causing Elisabeth's right index finger to rapidly age. Elisabeth contacts the supplier, who warns that delaying the switching schedule will lead to irreversible, rapid aging of the original body. Elisabeth and Sue gradually become separate personalities and begin to hate each other; Elisabeth resents Sue's frequent disregard of the switching schedule, causing further aging, while Sue is appalled by Elisabeth's descent into unhealthy binge-eating. Following a particularly destructive episode as Elisabeth, Sue stockpiles stabilizer fluid and refuses to switch back. Three months later, on the day before the New Year's Eve show, Sue runs out of stabilizer fluid and contacts the supplier, who informs her she must switch back to replenish the fluid. When they switch, Elisabeth finds herself transformed into a deformed, hag-like hunchback. To stop Sue aging her further, Elisabeth orders a serum designed to terminate her. However, Elisabeth, still craving Sue's celebrity status, stops before fully injecting the serum and resuscitates Sue, leaving both of them conscious. Realizing Elisabeth's initial intent, Sue beats Elisabeth to death before leaving to host the New Year's Eve show. Without Elisabeth, Sue's body rapidly deteriorates. She attempts to create a new version of herself using the leftover serum, despite the single-use warning. This results in the creation of a grotesque mutated body, \"Monstro Elisasue\", with both Elisabeth and Sue's faces. Wearing a mask cut from a poster of Elisabeth, Monstro Elisasue attempts to host the show, but the audience erupts into chaos when her disguise falls off. An audience member decapitates her, only for an even more mutated head to grow back, and one of her arms to break and drench the audience and studio in blood. Fleeing the studio, Monstro Elisasue collapses and explodes into viscera. Elisabeth's original face detaches from the gore, crawling onto her neglected star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She smiles as she hallucinates being admired before melting into a puddle of blood, which is cleaned up by a floor scrubber the next day.",

    "film_title": "Die My Love",
    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 to 700 words. --> Jackson's uncle leaves his Montana home to him after his death. Jackson decides to move there from New York with his pregnant girlfriend, Grace. Soon after the couple moves in, Grace gives birth to a baby boy. While initially happy and playful in their rural abode, Grace and Jackson begin to have problems, not long after the baby's birth. He is away at work for long periods, while she feels stuck at home; her feelings of boredom, loneliness, and abandonment worsen when she believes that Jackson is sleeping with other women while he is on the road for work, due to finding condoms in his car that he says were left there by a male friend (Greg, whom we only see in the film once briefly, later, at a party). Sexually and emotionally frustrated, Grace masturbates at home and in the woods surrounding her house. It is revealed that in the months leading up to the baby's birth, Jackson's father Harry passed away. Grace visits Jackson's mother, Pam, now a widow, seeking company and support. The two women talk over iced tea about the challenges Pam has faced, navigating the world without Harry, but when the conversation turns to Grace's mood swings and trouble coping with her current circumstances, Grace leaves. Grace is also disturbed to learn from Pam that Jackson's uncle who died and left them the house had died by suicide inside of it by shooting himself up his rectum. Grace is incredulous, asking why he committed suicide in such an unusual way. Jackson brings home a dog without checking in with Grace, but she does not welcome this new addition, especially as it constantly barks and cannot be calmed. One night, after the dog is injured in a car accident, she demands that Jackson shoot it, asserting, \"Something you love is suffering. Put it out of its misery.\" When Jackson refuses to shoot the dog, saying he will take it to the vet the next day, Grace shoots it herself. As time goes on, Grace's behavior grows increasingly erratic. She walks around with knives, begins an affair with a stranger who drives by the house on a motorcycle and, on one occasion, throws herself through a glass door when particularly upset. In the midst of all this, Grace and Jackson fight continuously, leading Grace to spin out and react more and more intensely. Despite their constant fighting, Jackson asks Grace to marry him one afternoon when the two are playing in the grass as they used to. The wedding and reception start off well, but by the end of the night, Jackson rebuffs Grace when she continues to ask him repeatedly to kiss her and leaves her to dance on her own. She eventually heads to the bridal suite alone. Waiting for Jackson, Grace asks the receptionist to bring her ice for a bottle of champagne; when the receptionist refuses, it is implied that she asks him to come sing for her in her hotel room. She dances to the music and, suddenly, bashes her head into a mirror, drawing blood. Grace returns home on foot with the baby in a stroller and, along the way, is spotted by Jackson, who silently admonishes her and guides mother and child into the car. Jackson commits Grace to a psychiatric institution. Here, a psychiatrist talks to her about her relationship with her parents and suggests that she has abandonment issues that stem from their death when she was a child. When Grace is released, she seems to be doing better, but her world has changed markedly during her brief time in the hospital. Jackson has bought a new car and cleaned, remodeled, and repainted the house in her absence. He has also come into possession of a new vehicle, which he says was a gift from the same male friend (Greg) whom he claims left the condoms in his old car. Grace is incredulous as to why Greg would give such an extravagant gift, asking the same question — “why?” — that she asked earlier about Jackson’s uncle’s unusual form of suicide. It is left to the audience to wonder about the gender of the person with whom Jackson may have been cheating on Grace. When the family hosts a welcome-back party for Grace, she snaps after hearing how \"healthy\" and \"well\" she looks and tries to leave. Jackson takes her on a drive, during which she finds more condoms in the glove box and expresses that she does not want to go back and that Jackson does not see her. When they reach a stopping point, they sit in silence for some time, before Grace kisses Jackson and says, \"Enough,\" walking into the nearby forest. Jackson continues to smoke a cigarette pensively while Grace sets fire to the journal she kept in the psychiatric ward. She leaves the journal to burn while she removes her dress. Jackson realizes that something is wrong and runs into the forest just in time to see Grace walk into the rapidly spreading fire.",

    "Synopsis": "In late May 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mayor Ted Garcia of Eddington, New Mexico, implements a lockdown and enforces mask mandates based on the governor's orders at the state level. Local sheriff Joe Cross disapproves, arguing the mandates violate freedom of choice. Joe lives with his emotionally unstable wife, Louise, and her conspiracy-theorist mother, Dawn. After confrontations with Ted, who is running for re-election with a tech-friendly campaign that would allow building a data center, Joe decides to run against him, much to the reclusive Louise's disapproval. He recruits deputies Guy and Michael as campaign aides. Louise and Dawn invite radical cult leader Vernon Jefferson Peak for dinner, and during a discussion about their conspiratorial beliefs about pedophilia and child trafficking, Louise hints that her father abused her. Joe expresses disbelief in Vernon's professed backstory, which is based on recovered memories. Meanwhile, Ted's son Eric gets involved in Black Lives Matter protests with his friend Brian and social justice-minded Sarah. Sarah unsuccessfully tries to persuade Michael to join their cause. To sway the election in his favor, Joe claims during a campaign event that Ted sexually assaulted Louise. She leaves town with Vernon after denying the allegations in an online video. The next day, Joe confronts Ted under the pretext of a noise complaint at his residence during a fundraiser. Ted slaps Joe in front of campaign fundraiser guests. That evening, Joe shoots a vagrant dead and dumps his body in a nearby river. He next shoots Ted and Eric in their home with a scoped rifle and stages the scene as an Antifa attack. Meanwhile, a mysterious private jet carrying heavily armed terrorists heads toward Eddington. Officer Butterfly Jimenez of the Pueblo tribe gets involved in the investigation of the deaths since Joe shot his rifle on Pueblo land. Joe frames Michael as the killer and jails him to divert attention, but Butterfly makes connections pointing to the sheriff. Eddington is attacked by the terrorists who kidnap Michael from the sheriff's office holding cell and set several fires during their escape. Joe and Guy find Michael in the desert, where he tries to warn them not to get close. An explosive detonates when the officers approach, killing Guy and severely wounding Michael. Joe heads back to Eddington, where he is targeted by snipers. After evading them in the desert and his home, he breaks into a gun store to arm himself. He fires his weapons haphazardly, accidentally shooting Butterfly's leg off who is then killed by a sniper moments later. Joe is eventually cornered and stabbed in the head by a terrorist, causing significant brain damage. He is saved by Brian, who guns down Joe's attacker while filming on his phone. One year later, Brian has become a prominent conservative influencer, having capitalized on his filmed rescue of Joe from the terrorists. Joe was elected as the Mayor of Eddington, despite the fact that he is now paralyzed and brain damaged as a result of his attack. Dawn serves as his caregiver, and speaks on Joe's behalf during public appearances. After returning from the grand opening of the newly constructed data center, Joe and Dawn watch news coverage of Vernon and a pregnant Louise at a rally. Michael, who also survived and is now undersheriff, practices target shooting on the outskirts of town.",

    "Synopsis": "A man with a prosthetic leg is driving his car at night with his wife and daughter when he accidentally hits and kills a dog. To repair his car, he visits a nearby garage where Vahid, an ethnic Azerbaijani auto mechanic, recognizes him from the sound his prosthetic leg makes after he speaks to his mother on the phone. The next day, Vahid follows the man, kidnaps him, and attempts to bury him in the desert. He tells him that he recognized his voice and stumbling walk as that of Eghbal (nicknamed \"peg leg\"), his former tormentor in an Iranian prison. The man denies being Eghbal and begs Vahid not to kill him, saying that the scars on his leg are recent, unlike Eghbal's. Doubting the man's identity, Vahid puts his unconscious body into the van and visits Salar at a bookshop. Salar refuses to help him identify the man but directs him to a woman named Shiva, a photographer in the middle of taking wedding photos of Goli and Ali, an engaged couple to be married the next day. Reluctant to help him, Shiva recognizes the smell of the man as that of Eghbal but is also unsure of his identity due to the fact that they were blindfolded during their torture/interrogations. Goli reveals that she was also tortured by Eghbal but cannot confirm his identity either, so they seek out the help of Hamid, Shiva's former partner, drugging their captive first and plugging his ears. Hamid instantly identifies the man as Eghbal after touching his legs and insists on killing him right away, but Vahid and Shiva hold him back, as they wish to hear him testify first. At that time, a cellphone rings from the man's body. Vahid picks it up and hears the man's daughter, who claims that her pregnant mother has fainted. The group visit the man's house and drive his daughter with her mother to a hospital, where the mother gives birth to a son. Hamid, Goli, and Ali grow frustrated and decide to leave Vahid and Shiva behind. The two then drive the man to a quiet location at night, tie him up to a tree, wake him up, and demand that he testify. The man first claims mistaken identity again, but then caves in and acknowledges that he is Eghbal, saying that his actions were justified for the good of the Iranian regime and that killing him would merely make him a martyr. Vahid and Shiva recount the torment they experienced in detail to Eghbal and tell him that his wife has given birth to a son. Shiva demands that Eghbal apologize and after a back-and-forth he says that he is sorry, claiming that he was only trying to make a living. Vahid then sets Eghbal free and drives away with Shiva. Later, Vahid and his mother prepare the van for his sister. A white car, similar to Eghbal's car, is seen entering the area while Vahid enters the house to retrieve something. He suddenly stops in his tracks. The sound of Eghbal's squeaky prosthetic leg is heard, first slowly approaching, then slowly moving away.",

    "Synopsis": "<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be 400 to 700 words. --> In 1959, Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut and Claude Chabrol—film critics for Cahiers du Cinéma—along with Suzanne Schiffman attend the film premiere of La Passe du diable, produced by Georges de Beauregard. At the afterparty, Godard harshly criticizes the film and pledges to become a film director, as his other colleagues have. Godard attends the Cannes Film Festival where Truffaut's film The 400 Blows becomes a resounding success, paving the way for aspiring young filmmakers. Godard decides to direct a film based on Truffaut's short outline, inspired by Michel Portail, a petty criminal who had stolen a car, and his American journalist girlfriend Beverly Lynette. Meanwhile, Godard casts Jean-Paul Belmondo, who has completed his military service, for the lead role as Michel Poiccard. Back at the office of Cahiers du Cinéma, Italian director Roberto Rossellini encourages the staff to avoid artistic artifice and shoot efficiently. Godard hires Pierre Rissient as the film's assistant director, and receives advice from Jean-Pierre Melville. Elsewhere, Jean Seberg promotes her latest film Bonjour Tristesse. Godard meets with Seberg through her husband François Moreuil, and decides to cast her as Patricia. Godard next hires cameraman Raoul Coutard and expresses his creative vision, desiring a guerilla filmmaking style and to shoot in the Academy ratio. On the first day of production, Godard films only a single scene. As production continues, Godard's continual script rewrites, continued emphasis on spontaneity, disregard for continuity, and the exceptionally short shooting days bewilders the cast and crew members. As Godard shoots scenes between her and Belmondo, Seberg becomes frustrated by Godard's directorial style and briefly considers leaving the production. Belmondo is told his career will be ruined. After a week of filming, Godard converses with Truffaut and Schiffman over drinks, where he is eager to cast Truffaut as an informant in the film. By the second week, Godard phones Coutard that he has suspended filming for the day, claiming he is not feeling well. Shortly after, Beauregard confronts Godard, angered that production has fallen behind schedule and threatens to cancel the film. Under pressure, Godard expedites the production and films further scenes between Seberg and Belmondo. During the middle of the second week, Godard casts himself as the informant after Truffaut has declined the role. He subsequently films a cameo of Jean-Pierre Melville near an airport. Later, Godard films the scene where Belmondo's character dies on the street. He and Seberg have a brief disagreement when Godard wants Seberg's character Patricia to search through the dying Michel's pockets, but Seberg refuses to play the scene that way. Instead, Seberg's Patricia questions what \"dégueulasse\" (disgusting) means. When Seberg finishes her last scene, she is relieved and heads back to Hollywood to film her next film, Let No Man Write My Epitaph. After 23 days of filming, Godard wraps the production. During post-production, Godard urges editor Cécile Decugis to make jump cuts, much to her disagreement. Godard then screens his film Breathless for Truffaut, Chabrol, Schiffman, and Beauregard who eagerly dismiss the film. However, Breathless became one of the most influential films ever made. An epilogue states Belmondo became an international star while Seberg divorced her husband, appeared in 35 films, and died at the age of 40. Godard's filmmaking career continued for more than 60 years.",

    "Synopsis": "In a world where humanity has given up dreaming in exchange for longevity, individuals known as \"The Other Ones\" seek out \"Deliriants\", beings who have retained such capacity. One monstrous Deliriant is tracked down by Miss Shu, an Other One. Moved by his dedication to the dream life, Shu decides to grant him a gentle death by installing a film projector inside him, and experiences the cinematic dreams he is projected into. The Deliriant resurfaces in the mid-20th century as Qiu, who is accused of murdering a man by stabbing him with a fountain pen. The Commander, seeking a mysterious suitcase the man carried that could end the ongoing war, tortures Qiu into revealing its location in a mirror shop. At the shop, he discovers a theremin within the suitcase. Utilizing the disorienting layout of the shop, Qiu stabs the Commander in one ear and escapes, but not before stating that he is in fact \"the suitcase\". The Commander later stabs himself in the other ear, and plays Bach's \"Come, Sweet Death\" on the theremin. He subsequently tracks down Qiu on a train and kills him; both burst into flames in the aftermath. Thirty years later, the Deliriant is now Mongrel, an art thief stranded in a ruined Buddhist temple. Breaking a bad tooth using a piece of a Buddha statue, he releases a trickster-like Spirit of Bitterness who had been reincarnated into the tooth. Mongrel confesses that he killed his father, whose appearance the Spirit has taken on, in order to spare him an agonising death from rabies. Despite their initial antagonism, the two eventually conduct a Buddhist ritual together. The Spirit achieves Enlightenment in the end, but the thief is turned into a dog. Some decades later, the Deliriant becomes Jia, a con artist who recruits an orphan girl as his sidekick. The girl's father abandoned her when she was little, leaving her a banknote with a riddle that she believes, once solved, would bring him back. Jia teaches the girl a series of elaborate tricks that allow her to supposedly recognise cards by smell, and the two later successfully swindle a mob boss. Jia plans to leave the girl behind but stumbles upon the banknote with a simple though profane answer to the riddle written on it. Before he can return to the girl, he is robbed and stabbed to death. Meanwhile, the mob boss asks the girl to figure out the final message his estranged daughter left him on a burnt piece of paper before her death. The girl smells the paper and does it successfully. In a port city on New Year's Eve, 1999, the Deliriant, now the young hoodlum Apollo, becomes smitten with a young singer and moll named Tai Zhaomei. He claims to have never kissed a girl, while she claims to have never bitten anyone. Wandering through the streets of the city, the two become separated, and Tai is dragged back to her karaoke bar by her boss, Mr. Luo. Apollo breaks into the bar and is severely beaten by Luo's henchmen, but Luo ultimately allows the couple to leave in peace and sail away on a boat. Tai reveals herself to be a vampire and bites Apollo in the neck with his consent. They kiss passionately as the sun rises, after which Apollo succumbs to his injuries and Tai is overwhelmed by the sunlight. The Deliriant dies after the final dream. Shu dresses him in his monster garbs, performs a funeral rite for him, and attempts to communicate with him one last time through the language of cinema. The film concludes in a wax movie theater, slowly filled up by bright figures that eventually melt away.",

    "Synopsis": "After film director Gustav Borg and psychotherapist Sissel end their troubled marriage, Gustav uses the divorce as an excuse to leave Norway and focus on his career. Sissel raises daughters Nora and Agnes in their Oslo home, which Gustav's family has owned for generations. In adulthood, Agnes works as a historian and is married with a son. Nora becomes a fairly successful actress, although she suffers from crippling bouts of stage fright. She is having an affair with her married colleague Jakob. After Sissel dies, Gustav returns to Norway to reclaim the house. His daughters have grown to resent him for his extended absences and his drinking problem, although Agnes is more sympathetic to him. He tries to reconcile with his daughters, but their conversations are frequently derailed by his microaggressions and lack of emotional intelligence. He has a better relationship with Agnes' young son Erik, but even then, he primarily connects with Erik through movies. Gustav's career is on the decline. He has trouble getting financing for his projects. His latest script was inspired by his mother Karin, a member of the Norwegian resistance movement who was tortured during the Nazi occupation. Karin died of suicide in the family home when Gustav was seven. Gustav proposes to film the movie in the actual home and to recreate Karin's suicide in the movie's climactic scene. He asks Nora to play the character inspired by her grandmother. Nora refuses to read the script. To replace Nora, Gustav hires American actress Rachel Kemp. Rachel's stardom convinces Netflix to finance the project. The production grows troubled. Gustav resents working with Netflix. Rachel, unable to speak Norwegian, grows self-conscious about the fact that Gustav had to translate the script into English for her. Nora is put off by the fact that Gustav treats Rachel with more empathy than his daughters. Jakob divorces his wife but refuses to commit to Nora, and Gustav infuriates Nora by suggesting that her internal rage prevents her from finding love. Nora loses interest in work. Agnes has a row with Gustav after he casts her son in the movie without her permission. She is reminded of Gustav casting her in a movie to connect with her, and bitterly remarks that the film did not make up for his general failure to spend time with her. Rachel realizes that the role is not right for her and that Gustav is still preoccupied with Nora. To restore Gustav's creative freedom, Rachel quits the film. That evening, Gustav goes outside and drunkenly throws a middle finger at the house before collapsing and being hospitalized. To understand her father better, Agnes visits the National Archives of Norway to read her grandmother's statement to the post-war government about her torture, which she otherwise refused to discuss with anyone. Sensing that Karin passed on her generational trauma to Gustav, she reads Gustav's script. She realizes that while the film's plot is inspired by Karin, its emotional arc reflects his sincere regrets about his broken relationship with Nora. Agnes is particularly struck by the final scene, which mirrors Gustav's mother's suicide, but in a present day setting. Moved, Nora agrees to join the film. Gustav finds the money to make the film without Rachel. Sometime later, production moves forward, now changed to a modern setting and filmed on a sound stage. Nora performs the climactic scene with Erik as her son. After the final take, she exchanges an understanding look with her father.",

    "Synopsis": "Luis, along with his son Esteban, travels to a rave held in the deserts of southern Morocco in search of his missing daughter, Mar. A subgroup of ravers tell them that another rave is taking place deeper in the desert afterwards, and that Mar could be there. When a group of soldiers arrive to stop the rave and order European ravers to be evacuated, the subgroup break away in two vans, with Luis, Esteban and their dog Pipa following suit in their compact van. Radio reports that armed conflict between two countries have commenced, which soon escalates into a World War III-like event. The ravers, consisting of Stef, Jade, Tonin, Bigui, and Josh, attempt to dissuade Luis and Esteban to no avail. Heading south to a location \"close to Mauritania\", the group encounter mishaps and grow closer. They share food and fuel, cross a river together in their vehicles, nurse Pipa back to health when she falls ill after eating the ravers' LSD-contaminated feces, and Tonin does a musical number while improvising a puppetry show using his leg stump. While crossing a mountain pass, one of the vans is stuck in a rut. The group manages to free the vehicle, but amid their celebration Luis's van rolls backwards off a cliff with Esteban and Pipa inside, killing them both. The remaining group members drive further into the desert looking for help, coming across a nomadic herder who runs off when approached. A grief-stricken Luis walks into the desert alone; he is rescued by Jade and Stef. Looking to lift the group's spirits, Jade asks them to use a psychoactive drug and improvises a rave in the desert with two loudspeakers. While in a trance, she dies in an explosion after stepping on a land mine. Trying to reach Jade, Tonin steps on another mine and is killed. Realising that they are in the middle of a minefield, the survivors are determined to reach a presumably mine-free rocky area some 60 metres away. They send one empty van forward, trying to secure a safe path; the van explodes after hitting a mine. They repeat the operation with the second van, but the van veers off course when it activates a second mine and is destroyed after hitting a third, failing to create the path they intended. Unfazed, Luis walks straight forward and reaches the area successfully. Bigui attempts to do the same but dies after stepping on a mine. With great hesitation, Stef and Josh follow suit with their eyes shut and safely reach Luis. They are later seen crossing the desert on the roof of a train along with other people.",

As the two become closer, America gets involved in World War I, David is drafted and Lionel, who is ineligible due to his eyesight, returns to his home state of Kentucky when the conservatory closes. He sets music aside to tend to his family's farm after his father dies suddenly. In 1919, Lionel receives a letter from David notifying him of his return from Europe, his employment in a Maine college and a department-funded trip across the state to collect folk songs on wax cylinders before inviting Lionel to accompany and assist him. The two reunite and travel around, capturing various folk songs from various walks of life and renewing their relationship. Eventually, they part ways again as David must return to work and Lionel plans to travel to Europe. Lionel corresponds with David via letters, only to stop writing after a year as he never receives a response. In 1923, Lionel, now living in Rome, tells his male lover Luca of his dissatisfaction singing in a local choir and of his taking a job at the University of Oxford, ending their relationship on bad terms. A year later, Lionel serves as conductor for the school's choir and is involved with student socialite Clarissa Roux, who invites him to meet her family at their country manor. During the trip, Lionel becomes overwhelmed with memories of David. The relationship with Clarissa also abruptly ends when Lionel must suddenly return to the United States due to his mother's grave illness. After putting his family's affairs in order, Lionel travels to Maine to find David, only to learn from a colleague that David had died some time after their trip and that his department never actually commissioned the trip, leaving the location of the wax cylinders unknown, before recommending Lionel get in touch with David's widow Belle. After meeting her family, Belle reveals she knows who Lionel is, how she and David became involved and how David's death was a suicide as a result of shell shock from the war, returns his letters and tells him she will send him the cylinders if they can be found. Lionel mourns David by visiting his favorite locations from youth and recounting a number of songs that endeared him to music, particularly \"The Unquiet Grave\". In 1980, Lionel, now an ethnomusicologist, is promoting his newest book when a package containing the wax cylinders arrives on his doorstep, including one made on the day of David's death. On the recording, David apologizes to Lionel and thanks him for their time together before singing \"Silver Dagger,\" the song Lionel sang to David when they first met.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1970 Framingham, Massachusetts, unemployed carpenter James Blaine \"J.B.\" Mooney schemes to steal four Arthur Dove paintings from the local art museum. Despite already having borrowed money from his parents, he borrows money from his mother under the pretense of using it for work so he can pay three men to pull off the heist, though the getaway driver backs out after stealing a car for the job. J.B. drives the two thieves, Guy Hickey and Ronnie Gibson, to the museum, where they successfully steal the paintings while Gibson pulls a gun on a student doing a homework assignment and beats up a security guard. J.B. proudly displays one of the stolen paintings in his living room, only to take it down when his father, a local judge, criticizes the thieves for their lack of ambition. He assembles a container for the paintings and hides them in the loft of a barn, returning home to find local police and the FBI questioning his family. They inform him that Gibson named him as the mastermind of the heist after being arrested while robbing a bank. J.B. denies his involvement and asks his furious wife Terri to take their sons Carl and Tommy to his parents' house, though Tommy refuses to go with her. Guy calls J.B. to press him for more money. When J.B. takes Tommy along to meet him, the meeting is revealed to be a setup when an organized crime outfit abducts J.B. and forces him to take them to the paintings' location. As his role in the robbery is made public, J.B. goes into hiding with Fred and Maude, his friends from art school. While Fred is excited by J.B.'s story, Maude privately confronts him, having deduced that J.B.'s plan was to use their old professor, a admirer of Dove, as a fence to sell the paintings. She asks him to leave, and J.B. rejects Fred's suggestion to hide out at his brother's Toronto commune in favor of traveling to Cleveland to stay with other friends. Upon arrival, he learns that they left town the day before, and hitchhikes to Cincinnati. After learning that the paintings were recovered and returned to the museum, J.B. calls Terri and attempts to rationalize his actions, but she hangs up when he asks for money. Unable to afford the bus fare to Toronto, he steals an elderly woman's pocketbook and escapes into a crowd of anti-Vietnam War protesters. The police violently break up the rally and arrest J.B. along with several protesters, ignoring his objections as he is put in the back of a police van and driven away.",

    "Synopsis": "In 1950, arms dealer and industrialist Anatole \"Zsa-Zsa\" Korda narrowly survives an assassination attempt. While unconscious, he enters the afterlife, where a divine court judges his worthiness to enter Heaven. Knowing he cannot run from assassins forever, Korda tries to mend his relationship with his only daughter, Catholic novice Sister Liesl. He asks Liesl to quit the Church and take over his business. Liesl's adoptive parents sent her away to a convent at the age of five. Korda and Liesl have a testy relationship; he is rumored to have murdered Liesl's mother, although he denies this. Liesl also meets Bjørn, a Norwegian entomologist and Korda's tutor for his nine sons, though he soon takes on the position of Korda's administrative assistant as the other one was blown in half during the previous assassination attempt. Governments around the world seek to curb Korda’s unethical business practices and his tendency to manipulate global conflict and peace to suit his own interests. An opportunity arises when Korda stakes his fortune on a risky scheme to overhaul the infrastructure of Phoenicia with slave labor. Government agent Excalibur conspires to drive up the price of building materials, which threatens to bankrupt Korda. With Liesl and Bjørn in tow, Korda meets with and attempts to swindle his investors. He deceitfully asks Californians Leland and Reagan to sign a contract increasing their financial contribution without telling them about the change, blackmails French nightclub owner Marseille Bob, and threatens to kill East Coast businessman Marty in a suicide bombing. Although his investors are enraged, Korda worms his way out of each scenario. However, the investors agree to cover only 50% of the budget shortfall. During the trip, Liesl and Korda explore their odd relationship. After taking a bullet for Marseille Bob, Korda meets Liesl's mother in the afterlife; she tells him that he is not Liesl's father. Korda realizes that all he had to offer his family was money, not love. In addition, during his confrontation with Marty, a guilt-ridden Korda admits he knew Liesl's mother was having an affair with his estranged half-brother Nubar. To get back at her, he faked a story that she was also having an affair with Nubar's assistant, which prompted Nubar to kill her. He also admits he still does business with Nubar, who has also invested in the Phoenician scheme. Liesl is outraged at her father's amorality but agrees to continue helping him so that she can send Nubar to jail. In a last-ditch attempt to avoid asking Nubar for help, Korda offers to marry his cousin Hilda, an heiress to the Korda armaments fortune. She accepts his proposal but refuses to increase her investment. On the flight back home, saboteurs destroy Korda's plane. The wreckage reveals evidence that Bjørn is a spy working for Excalibur's consortium. However, he agrees to switch sides, as he has fallen in love with Liesl. Korda explains to Liesl that their family has been dysfunctional for generations. Disturbed, Liesl resolves to quit the family business and return to the Church. A group of guerillas rescue the party and take them home, where Liesl's mother superior dismisses her from the order, explaining that she is too materialistic for the religious life. Korda, Liesl, and Bjørn finally meet with Nubar, who denies being Liesl's real father and announces that he is withdrawing his entire investment. Having failed to meet the budget shortfall with Nubar's withdrawal, Korda decides to change his ways: he converts to Catholicism, pays his workers, and throws his entire fortune into completing the Phoenician scheme, reasoning that finishing a worthy project will give his life meaning. Korda's investors gather at the Desert Oasis Palace hotel to witness a presentation of his scheme, where Nubar returns and reveals that he was the one trying to kill Korda all along, reasoning that life is a game of \"who could lick whom\". Nubar tries to kill Korda in a brawl, but Korda defeats him. Although Korda is bankrupted, Liesl is impressed and agrees to accept him as her father. The two retire to a simpler life running a small bistro. Hilda has her brief marriage to Korda annulled and gives back her wedding ring. Korda loans the ring to Bjørn, who proposes to Liesl; she accepts. At the end of the day, Liesl and Korda play cards together as a family.",

Nearby, since the passing of his wife Fátima, Armando's son Fernando is being raised by his grandfather Sr. Alexandre, a projectionist at . Meanwhile, corrupt chief of police Euclides and his sons Sergio and Arlindo are called during the holiday after a human leg is found inside a captured tiger shark. Armando is located at the city's social registration archive under the alias of Marcelo, and is welcomed by Euclides, who offers him protection. Euclides' arrogant behavior visibly annoys Armando, which includes harassing Hans, a Jewish Holocaust survivor who is mistakenly assumed to be a Nazi fugitive. Meanwhile, in São Paulo, hitmen Bobbi and Augusto are hired by a former Eletrobras executive director to kill Armando, with whom he has a political and personal vendetta. Sergio and Arlindo dispose of the human leg in the Capibaribe River, where it suddenly revives and attacks gay men cruising in a public park at night; the story, presumably a newspaper cover-up for the political corruption and violence during the carnival week, creates a public frenzy. Contacted by Elza, the leader of a political resistance movement in the Brazilian northeast, Armando is instructed to flee the country in the following days and informed of the imminent danger. Augusto and Bobbi hire a local impoverished gunman, Vilmar, to find Armando. Anticipating an escape, Armando bids farewell to Dona Sebastiana and the other refugees. The next morning, he relentlessly searches for any documents of his late mother, \"India\", of whom he has few memories. Vilmar identifies Armando but fails to kill him, shooting Arlindo and a fellow police officer. Bobbi, watching from afar, chases a bleeding Vilmar through Recife's downtown and is later killed in a barbershop by Vilmar. In the present day, history student Flavia researches Elza's resistance network through her audio recordings and newspaper archives, learning that Armando was assassinated and framed as a corrupt professor. Traveling to Recife, Flavia meets with Fernando, now a middle-aged doctor, who agrees to be interviewed in the hospital where he works after Flavia donates blood. Discussing Armando's political past and murder, Fernando states he does not have a single memory of his father, but fondly recalls watching Jaws with his grandfather at a movie theater which has since become the hospital where he works.",

    "film_title": "Two Prosecutors",
    "Synopsis": "In 1937, amid Joseph Stalin's Great Purge, Kornyev, a young Soviet prosecutor who recently graduated from law school, comes across a letter written by a prisoner in Bryansk. Believing the man to be the victim of NKVD corruption, he attends the prison and obtains a visit through his oversight role in the local prosecutor's office. Kornyev meets Stepniak, an imprisoned Old Bolshevik and local party stalwart. He earns the old man's trust by recounting how he had attended one of Stepniak's speeches about truth and Bolshevism at his law school. Stepniak shows Kornyev torture wounds received after refusing to falsely confess and begs him to tell Stalin or members of the Politburo about the wrongful convictions and illegal actions taken against loyal citizens who learn of or resist the NKVD's corruption. As Kornyev leaves, a prison official observing him makes a phone call while insulting his intelligence. Kornyev travels to Moscow by train and tries to sleep. However, he is constantly woken up by a peglegged World War I veteran of the Battle of Kowel telling a story about how he had visited Vladimir Lenin in Smolny and had eventually gotten alms and was now seeking the same from Stalin. At the Procurator General's office, Kornyev struggles to navigate the Soviet bureaucracy but is given a chance at an appointment after an earnest plea to Procurator General Andrey Vyshinsky's secretary. After enduring a long wait, Kornyev meets Vyshinsky, tells him about the conditions in Bryansk, and shows him Stepniak's bloody letter. Kornyev also explains that he came directly to Vyshinsky because he fears the local prosecutor's office is cowed by the local NKVD. Vyshinsky tells him that without strong documentary evidence, his office cannot open an inquiry into the NKVD and sends him back to Bryansk with documents authorizing him to conduct further investigations. On the train back, Kornyev is seated with Vasily and Petya, who introduce themselves as engineers before giving toasts to Soviet law and playing the counterplan song on guitar for him. In Bryansk, the three share a ride out of the train station and Petya aggressively questions Kornyev about his virginity before they drive past Kornyev's destination. Vasily tells Kornyev that he is under arrest and the car enters the prison facility.",
