            Identify the discrepancy between box-office performance and

          <h2>LLM Data Collection</h2>
          <p>
            This study differs from the previous one only in how the Comedy
            variable is constructed. Because LLM-based annotation is
            computationally expensive, we limited the analysis to 500 films,
            selecting the most popular titles according to TMDB’s dynamic
            popularity score. This choice increases the likelihood that the
            model has prior knowledge of the films.

              Qwen2.5-7B model </a
            >, a large language model (LLM), meaning an
            <strong>artificial intelligence system</strong> trained on vast
            amounts of text to analyze and generate language, chosen as a
            compromise between performance and computational feasibility.

          <p>
            Comedy scores, justifications, and self-reported knowledge levels
            were generated for all films. After removing uncertain or
            low-confidence cases through post-processing filters, the final
            dataset consists of <strong>N = 440 films</strong>.

          <h2>Comedy Classification</h2>
          <p>
            For this analysis, we chose to classify comedy based on the prior
            knowledge of an LLM.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            The LLM assigned each film a <strong>Comedy Score (1–10)</strong>
            based on the movie’s intent to provoke laughter, distinguishing pure
            comedy (10) from genre hybrids (8–9), balanced dramedy/action (5–7),
            and mostly serious films with only comic relief (1–4). To avoid
            overestimation and guessing, it returned 0 when it lacked sufficient
            knowledge, along with a self-reported knowledge level and a brief
            justification.

          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>
            The regression shows that the level of comedy in a film increases
            slightly with its log box-office revenue (b = 0.004, R² = 0.000),
            but the result is not significant (p = 0.698). The level of comedy
            also decreases with its press rating (b = -0.378, R² = 0.002),
            although this effect is not significant (p = 0.359). In contrast,
            <strong
              >the level of comedy decreases significantly with audience
              rating</strong
            >
            (b = -0.560, p &lt; 0.05, R² = 0.009).

          Each point corresponds to a unique film, and its position depends on
          its level of comedy and (1) revenue, (2) audience rating, (3) press
          rating.
